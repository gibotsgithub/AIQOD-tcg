gaining any real benefit from such a switch;

benefit at a higher cost or same cost to the client, or the same 
level of benefit at a higher cost; and

ANNEX 4 - RISK WARNING STATEMENT FOR OVERSEAS- 
LISTED INVESTMENT PRODUCTS 
 
OVERSEAS-LISTED INVESTMENT PRODUCTS 
 
RISK WARNING 
 
An overseas-listed investment product* is subject to the laws and 
regulations of the jurisdiction it is listed in. Before you trade in an overseas- 
listed investment product or authorise someone else to trade for you, you 
should be aware of: 
 
• The level of investor protection and safeguards that you are afforded 
in the relevant foreign jurisdiction as the overseas-listed investment 
product would operate under a different regulatory regime. 
• The differences between the legal systems in the foreign jurisdiction 
and Singapore that may affect your ability to recover your funds. 
• The tax implications, currency risks, and additional transaction costs 
that you may have to incur. 
• The counterparty and correspondent broker risks that you are exposed 
to. 
• The political, economic and social developments that influence the 
overseas markets you are investing in. 
 
These and other risks may affect the value of your investment. You should 
not invest in the product if you do not understand or are not comfortable 
with such risks. 
 
*An “overseas-listed investment product” in this statement refers to a 
capital markets product that is approved in-principle for listing and 
quotation only on, or listed for quotation or quoted only on, one or more 
overseas exchange(s). 
 
1. 
This statement is provided to you in accordance with paragraph 41C of 
the Notice on Recommendations on Investment Products [FAA-N16]. 


Notice on Recommendations On Investment Products 
55 
 
 
2. 
This statement does not disclose all the risks and other significant 
aspects of trading in an overseas-listed investment product. You should 
undertake such transactions only if you understand and are comfortable 
with the extent of your exposure to the risks. 
 
3. 
You should carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you 
in light of your experience, objectives, risk appetite, financial resources 
and other relevant circumstances. In considering whether to trade or to 
authorise someone else to trade for you, you should be aware of the 
following: 
 
Differences in Regulatory Regimes 
 
(a) 
Overseas markets may be subject to different regulations, and may 
operate differently from approved exchanges in Singapore. For 
example, there may be different rules providing for the safekeeping 
of securities and monies held by custodian banks or depositories. This 
may affect the level of safeguards in place to ensure proper 
segregation and safekeeping of your investment products or monies 
held overseas. There is also the risk of your investment products or 
monies not being protected if the custodian has credit problems or 
fails. Overseas markets may also have different periods for clearing 
and settling transactions. These may affect the information available 
to you regarding transaction prices and the time you have to settle 
your trade on such overseas markets. 
 
(b) 
Overseas markets may be subject to rules which may offer different 
investor protection as compared to Singapore. Before you start to trade, 
you should be fully aware of the types of redress available to you in 
Singapore and other relevant jurisdictions, if any. 
 
(c) 
Overseas-listed investment products may not be subject to the same 
disclosure standards that apply to investment products listed for 
quotation or quoted on an approved exchange in Singapore. Where 
disclosure is made, differences in accounting, auditing and financial 
reporting standards may also affect the quality and comparability of 
information provided. It may also be more difficult to locate up-to-date 
information, and the information published may only be available in a 
foreign language. 


Notice on Recommendations On Investment Products 
56 
 
 
Differences in legal systems 
 
(d) In some countries, legal concepts which are practiced in mature legal 
systems may not be in place or may have yet to be tested in courts. This 
would make it more difficult to predict with a degree of certainty the 
outcome of judicial proceedings or even the quantum of damages 
which may be awarded following a successful claim. 
 
(e) The Monetary Authority of Singapore will be unable to compel the 
enforcement of the rules of the regulatory authorities or markets in 
other jurisdictions where your transactions will be effected. 
 
(f) The laws of some jurisdictions may prohibit or restrict the repatriation 
of funds from such jurisdictions including capital, divestment 
proceeds, profits, dividends and interest arising from investment in 
such countries. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the funds you have 
invested and the funds arising from your investment will be capable of 
being remitted. 
 
(g) Some jurisdictions may also restrict the amount or type of investment 
products that foreign investors may trade. This can affect the liquidity 
and prices of the overseas-listed investment products that you invest 
in. 
 
Different costs involved 
 
(h) There may be tax implications of investing in an overseas-listed 
investment product. For example, sale proceeds or the receipt of any 
dividends and other income may be subject to tax levies, duties or 
charges in the foreign country, in Singapore, or in both countries. 
 
(i) Your investment return on foreign currency-denominated investment 
products will be affected by exchange rate fluctuations where there is 
a need to convert from the currency of denomination of the investment 
products to another currency, or may be affected by exchange controls. 
 
(j) You may have to pay additional costs such as fees and broker’s 
commissions for transactions in overseas exchanges. In some 
jurisdictions, you may also have to pay a premium to trade certain 


Notice on Recommendations On Investment Products 
57 
 
 
listed investment products. Therefore, before you begin to trade, you 
should obtain a clear explanation of all commissions, fees and other 
charges for which you will be liable. These charges will affect your net 
profit (if any) or increase your loss. 
 
Counterparty and correspondent broker risks 
 
(k) Transactions on overseas exchanges or overseas markets are generally 
effected by your Singapore broker through the use of foreign brokers 
who have trading and/or clearing rights on those exchanges. All 
transactions that are executed upon your instructions with such 
counterparties and correspondent brokers are dependent on their 
respective due performance of their obligations. The insolvency or 
default of such counterparties and correspondent brokers may lead to 
positions being liquidated or closed out without your consent and/or 
may result in difficulties in recovering your monies and assets held 
overseas. 
 
Political, Economic and Social Developments 
 
(l) Overseas markets are influenced by the political, economic and social 
developments in the foreign jurisdiction, which may be uncertain and 
may increase the risk of investing in overseas-listed investment 
products.
