Assets Pledged 
“Assets Pledged” is a booking concept. As such, only pledged assets 
booked in Singapore should be reported for foreign banks. Pledged 
assets booked outside of Singapore would not fall within the reporting 
scope. For the Overseas Bank Subsidiaries and Overseas Branches of 
local banks, assets which are booked and pledged in the respective 
entities are reportable. 
 
Assets pledged in Intra-group (head office, other branches of head 
office, subsidiaries) entities that are used for centralized collateral 
pledging should not be reported. 
Appendix B3 
Annex 6 
2 
Assets Under 
Management 
("AUM") 
The assets listed in the Instructions are non-exhaustive. Banks or 
Merchant Banks should also report any other assets that are counted as 
part of assets under management. 
 
AUM of unit trust should be determined by multiplying the latest NAV 
(Net Assets Value) of the unit trust fund with the number of units as of 
the reporting date. 
Appendix B3 
Annex 5

Borrower 
The "Immediate Borrowers" concept is applicable throughout the 
reporting forms except for Appendix D1.

Business Lines 
Banks or Merchant Banks should first map their business functions into 
the 7 categories of Business Lines.  If one product is marketed by two or 
more business lines, the classification should be based on the business 
line where the activity took place.  Banks or Merchant Banks are 
discouraged from categorising revenue-generating functions in "Others" 
as much as possible. 
Appendix J 
5 
Business Lines 
Part I Description of Business Activities: The business activities are not 
limited to those recorded in the local book, i.e. it should include all the 
activities performed by Banks or Merchant Banks including those carried 
out for their related corporations or head office etc.   
  
For items VI, VII and VIII in Selected Statistics, the “Outstanding 
Amounts” refer to the amounts booked by Banks or Merchant Banks in 
their Singapore accounting records. 
 
For items II, III, IV and V, Banks or Merchant Banks should report so long 
as there is a Singapore nexus. 
 
For example: 
 - “Operational losses and number of incidents” include scenarios where 
operational losses were incurred and booked in the Banks or Merchant 
Banks; operational losses took place in Hong Kong branch but booked in 
the Banks or Merchant Banks; and operational incidents that took place 
in Singapore but were booked outside of Singapore. 
 - “Customer complaints” include complaints against Singapore 
relationship managers by customers of the Banks or Merchant Banks, 
and complaints against relationship managers of the Banks or Merchant 
Banks by overseas branch's customers. 
Appendix J

Business Lines - 
Retail Banking  
Complaints relating to corporate actions, bonds custodian charges, 
alleged mis-selling or product mis-representation of investment 
advisory services related to FAA related products, online securities 
trading and funds transfers should be reported under Retail Banking 
Business activity.

Capital Markets 
Services Licence 
Entities 
For the purpose of Appendix C1 Annex 3 reporting, Capital Markets 
Services Licence entities should not be included in "Banking Group". 
Appendix C1 
Annex 3 
8 
Classified Assets 
The outstanding amounts comprise principal and accrued interest 
receivable for revolving credit facilities where the interest is capitalised.  
For credit facilities where the interest accruals are separately accounted 
for such as term loans, the outstanding amount is just the principal 
amount.  
Appendix F 
9 
Collateral 
For the purpose of reporting, in determining the secured portion of 
credit facilities, only tangible assets should be considered.  As such, the 
fixed and floating charges on assets are considered “unsecured” for the 
purpose of reporting, unless the said assets are held under the custody 
of the Banks or Merchant Banks. 
All relevant 
reporting 
forms
