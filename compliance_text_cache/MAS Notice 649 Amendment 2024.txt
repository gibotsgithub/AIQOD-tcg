For the purposes of paragraph 8(f), (g)(ii) and (g)(iii), where the debt security or sukuk 
is issued by a sovereign or central bank, and the debt security or sukuk does not have any 
 
7 
To avoid doubt, where an issue of such debt securities or sukuk is partially redeemed such that the 
outstanding issue size falls below S$200 million, those debt securities or sukuk would no longer be eligible 
as Liquid Assets under paragraph 8(g)(i) and (ii).

credit rating assigned to it by Fitch Ratings, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services or Moody’s 
Investor Services, the Reporting Bank may –

Ratings, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services or Moody’s Investor Services as

Services, treat the credit rating of the sovereign of the country or jurisdiction 
of the central bank assigned by Fitch Ratings, Standard & Poor’s Ratings 
Services or Moody’s Investor Services as that assigned to the debt security or 
sukuk. 
 
Valuation of Liquid Assets 
 
10 
When computing the amount of Liquid Assets held by a Reporting Bank on any 
maintenance day, the Reporting Bank must use – 
 
(a) 
in the case of its bills of exchange, the book value of those bills of exchange; 
and 
 
(b) 
in the case of its Liquid Assets other than bills of exchange, the marked-to-
market value of those Liquid Assets as of the computation day to which that 
maintenance day relates, multiplied by the following relevant percentage: 
 
(i) 
where the Liquid Asset is a debt security or sukuk set out in paragraph 
8(g)(i) to (iv), and the Reporting Bank holds more than 20% of the total 
market of the particular issue of the debt security or sukuk (including 
issues from different tranches), 50%; 
 
(ii) 
where the Liquid Asset is a debt security or sukuk set out in paragraph 
8(g)(i), and the Reporting Bank does not hold more than 20% of the 
total market of the particular issue of the debt security or sukuk 
(including issues from different tranches), 90%; 
 
(iii) 
where the Liquid Asset is a debt security or sukuk set out in paragraph 
8(g)(ii), and the Reporting Bank does not hold more than 20% of the 
total market of the particular issue of the debt security or sukuk 
(including issues from different tranches), the percentage determined 
in accordance with Appendix 3; 
 


10 
 
(iv) 
for all other Liquid Assets not set out in sub-paragraphs (b)(i) to (b)(iii), 
100%. 
 
11 
Despite paragraph 10(b), a Reporting Bank may, upon giving prior written notice of at 
least one month to the Authority, use the marked-to-market value of its Liquid Assets other 
than bills of exchange as of a maintenance day when computing the amount of Liquid Assets 
held by the Reporting Bank on the maintenance day. A Reporting Bank that has adopted the 
treatment in this paragraph must obtain the Authority’s prior written approval to adopt the 
treatment in paragraph 10(b) subsequently.8 
 
Computation of Qualifying Liabilities 
 
12 
A Reporting Bank must compute its Qualifying Liabilities as the sum of9 – 
 
(a) 
all liabilities of the Reporting Bank denominated in the relevant currency or 
currencies, as the case may be, due to non-bank customers other than the 
Authority and merchant banks in Singapore, computed on a gross basis; 
 
(b) 
all liabilities of the Reporting Bank denominated in the relevant currency or 
currencies, as the case may be, due to the Authority, that – 
 
(i) 
are due within one month from the computation day; and 
 
(ii) 
are computed on a net basis after the deduction of all claims 
denominated in the relevant currency or currencies, as the case may 
be, by the Reporting Bank on the Authority, that – 
 
(A) 
are maturing within one month from the computation day; 
 
(B) 
are not Liquid Assets10; and 
 
(C) 
are not cash receivables from the Authority arising from reverse 
repurchase agreements of Liquid Assets transacted with the 
Authority, 
 
and where this is a net asset, the Reporting Bank may deduct the net asset 
amount from Qualifying Liabilities; 
 
 
8 
The Authority will not ordinarily grant such an approval except in exceptional circumstances. 
9 
To avoid doubt, this excludes any contingent liability of the Reporting Bank. 
10 
To avoid doubt, as MAS Bills held by the Reporting Bank, including those held under a reverse repurchase 
agreement, are Liquid Assets, cash receivables from MAS Bills cannot be deducted when computing the 
liabilities of the Reporting Bank due to the Authority on a net basis under paragraph 12(b)(ii). 


11 
 
(c) 
all liabilities of the Reporting Bank denominated in the relevant currency or 
currencies, as the case may be, due to Relevant Entities, that – 
 
(i) 
are due within one month from the computation day; and 
 
(ii) 
are computed on a net basis after the deduction of all claims 
denominated in the relevant currency or currencies, as the case may 
be, by the Reporting Bank on Relevant Entities, that – 
 
(A) 
are maturing within one month from the computation day; 
 
(B) 
are not Liquid Assets11; 
 
(C) 
are not cash receivables from convertible debt securities or 
sukuk, issued by Relevant Entities; and 
 
(D) 
are not cash receivables from Relevant Entities arising from 
reverse repurchase agreements of Liquid Assets transacted 
with Relevant Entities, 
 
and where this is a net asset, the Reporting Bank must not deduct the net asset 
amount from Qualifying Liabilities and must treat the net asset amount as zero; 
 
(d) 
15% of all undrawn commitments of the Reporting Bank denominated in the 
relevant currency or currencies, as the case may be. For the purposes of the 
Singapore Dollar MLA requirement, where the undrawn commitment is a 
multi-currency facility involving the Singapore dollars as a component currency, 
the Reporting Bank must include the entire facility amount as its undrawn 
commitment for its computation of its Singapore Dollar Qualifying Liabilities. 
However, if there is a sub-limit for the Singapore dollars in the facility, the 
Reporting Bank may use the sub-limit amount for its computation of its 
Singapore Dollar Qualifying Liabilities; 
 
 
11 
Claims on Relevant Entities that are not Liquid Assets include – 
(a) deposits placed with any Relevant Entity; 
(b) certificates of deposit issued by any Relevant Entity; 
(c) loans extended to any Relevant Entity; 
(d) cash receivables from debt securities or sukuk which are not Liquid Assets and are issued by any 
Relevant Entity (“Relevant Debt Securities or Sukuk”). To avoid doubt, claims on Relevant Entities that 
are not Liquid Assets include cash receivables from Relevant Debt Securities or Sukuk that are posted 
as collateral by the Reporting Bank in a repurchase agreement but does not include cash receivables 
from Relevant Debt Securities or Sukuk that are held by the Reporting Bank under a reverse repurchase 
agreement; and 
(e) cash receivables from any Relevant Entity, other than arising from (a) to (d) above. 


12 
 
(e) 
all liabilities of the Reporting Bank denominated in the relevant currency or 
currencies, as the case may be, arising from the issue of bills of exchange, other 
than a bill of exchange which satisfies the requirements set out in Appendix 1; 
and 
 
(f) 
all liabilities of the Reporting Bank denominated in the relevant currency or 
currencies, as the case may be, arising from – 
 
(i) 
the provision of any e-money issuance service as defined in section 2(1) 
of the Payment Services Act 2019; and 
 
(ii) 
the issuance of any limited purpose e-money; 
 
but does not include any liability of the Reporting Bank arising from – 
 
(g) 
any funds received through repurchase agreements of Liquid Assets; 
 
(h) 
any funds received through currency, interest rate and foreign exchange swaps; 
 
(i) 
any issue of subordinated debt, the terms of which comply with the criteria for 
the treatment of the liabilities as capital in its computation of its capital 
adequacy ratio under section 10(2) of the Act, whether or not the entire 
amount of such liabilities is in fact treated in such computation as capital; and 
 
(j) 
any funds raised through the discounting of any bill of exchange which satisfies 
the requirements set out in Appendix 1, with other banks, merchant banks in 
Singapore or finance companies (as defined in section 2 of the Finance 
Companies Act 1967). 
 
MLA Framework 
 
13 
A Reporting Bank must hold, at all times12 – 
 
(a) 
Liquid Assets denominated in any currency amounting to no less than 16% of 
the value of its Qualifying Liabilities denominated in any currency (“all currency 
MLA requirement”); and 
 
(b) 
Liquid Assets denominated in Singapore dollars amounting to no less than 16% 
of the value of its Singapore Dollar Qualifying Liabilities (“Singapore Dollar MLA 
requirement”). 
 
12 
A Reporting Bank should ensure its liquidity risk management is sound and commensurate with the size, 
nature and complexity of its activities, and observe the guidelines in Appendix 8. 


13 
 
 
14 
A Reporting Bank must treat every business day as a computation day. On a 
maintenance day, a Reporting Bank must hold the Singapore Dollar MLA requirement and the 
all currency MLA requirement, respectively, that was computed on the relevant computation 
day. Where a day is not a business day, a Reporting Bank must hold for that day, the Singapore 
Dollar MLA requirement and the all currency MLA requirement of the immediately preceding 
maintenance day which is a business day. Appendix 4 sets out the computation and 
maintenance schedules for a Reporting Bank determining its Singapore Dollar MLA 
requirement and all currency MLA requirement. 
 
Minimum Amount of Tier-1 Liquid Assets 
 
15 
A Reporting Bank must hold, at all times – 
 
(a) 
Tier-1 Liquid Assets denominated in any currency amounting to no less than 8% 
of the value of its Qualifying Liabilities denominated in any currency; and 
 
(b) 
Tier-1 Liquid Assets denominated in Singapore dollars amounting to no less 
than 8% of the value of its Singapore Dollar Qualifying Liabilities. 
 
Utilisation of Liquid Assets 
 
16 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
give prior written notification to the Authority of its intent to utilise its Liquid 
Assets in a liquidity stress situation, where such utilisation will cause the 
Reporting Bank’s MLA to fall below the prevailing minimum requirements as 
described in paragraphs 13 and 15; and 
 
(b) 
ensure that the notification is signed by its chief executive, chief financial 
officer or any equivalent senior management. 
 
17 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
provide its justification for the utilisation of Liquid Assets; 
 
(b) 
set out the cause of the liquidity stress situation and provide supporting 
documents, where available; and 
 
(c) 
detail the steps which it has taken and is going to take to resolve the liquidity 
stress situation, 
 
to the Authority within one business day after the utilisation of its Liquid Assets. 


14 
 
 
18 
A Reporting Bank must keep the Authority informed of material developments during 
the liquidity stress situation. 
 
Submission of liquidity returns 
 
19 
A Reporting Bank must prepare the appropriate liquidity returns set out at Appendix 
5 as at the last day of each month. 
 
20 
A Reporting Bank must submit all returns prepared in accordance with paragraph 19 
to the Authority electronically through MASNET not later than 14 days after the last day of 
each month. 
 
21

is not a business day, the Reporting Bank may submit the return on the next business day.

LCR Framework 
 
24 
A Reporting Bank must maintain at all times19 –

a Singapore Dollar LCR of at least 100% and an all currency LCR of at least 100%; 
and 
 
(b) 
in all other cases, a Singapore Dollar LCR of at least 100% and an all currency 
LCR of at least 50%. 
 
25 
Pursuant to section 65(2) of the Act, a Reporting Bank referred to in paragraph 24(a) 
must comply with the requirements on Singapore Dollar LCR and all currency LCR on a 
consolidated (“Group”) level, which consolidates the assets and liabilities of all its banking 
group entities, other than those of the following banking group entities, if any: 
 
19 
A Reporting Bank should ensure its liquidity risk management is sound and commensurate with the size, 
nature and complexity of its activities, and observe the guidelines in Appendix 8. 


21 
 
 
(a) 
an insurance subsidiary; 
 
(b) 
any other entity, where such non-consolidation of assets and liabilities of the 
entity is expressly permitted under the Accounting Standards. To avoid doubt, 
the exemption for an entity that is a parent from presenting consolidated 
financial statements in paragraph 4(a) of Singapore Financial Reporting 
Standards 110 (“SFRS 110”) Consolidated Financial Statements does not apply 
to the Reporting Bank for the purposes of complying with this paragraph.

27 
A Reporting Bank must only use HQLA denominated in Singapore dollars to fulfil the 
requirements on Singapore Dollar LCR. To avoid doubt, the total net cash outflows for the 
Singapore Dollar LCR only include total net cash outflows denominated in Singapore dollars. 
 
HQLA

of including the liquid assets as Level 2 HQLA, subject to the requirements 
specified in paragraph 149. 
 
[MAS Notice 649 (Amendment) 2024] 
 
29 
For the purposes of determining the eligibility of a security or sukuk as a liquid asset 
under paragraph 28(f)(i)(A), (i)(iii)(A), (j)(iii)(A), (k)(iii)(A) and (l)(ii), – 
 
(a)

the Reporting Bank must use the poorer credit rating for that particular issue 
of the security or sukuk; and 
 
(b) 
where there are more than 2 credit ratings for a particular issue of the security 
or sukuk, the Reporting Bank must use the higher of the 2 poorest credit 
ratings for that particular issue of the security or sukuk. 
 
30 
Despite paragraph 28(f)(i)(A), (i)(iii)(A), (j)(iii)(A), (k)(iii)(A) and (l)(ii), a Reporting Bank 
may recognise local rating scales (rather than international ratings) of a recognised ECAI if the 
corporate debt securities or covered bonds relevant securities, covered bonds or sukuk are 
held by the Reporting Bank for local currency liquidity needs arising from its operations in that 
local country or jurisdiction. 
 
[MAS Notice 649 (Amendment) 2024] 
 
Operational requirements 
 
31 
A Reporting Bank must treat a liquid asset as HQLA only if the liquid asset complies 
with the following operational requirements27: 
 
(a) 
the liquid asset is unencumbered28 and is not pledged whether explicitly or 
implicitly, to secure, collateralise or credit-enhance any transaction, nor be 
designated to cover operational costs29; 
 
 
27 
A Reporting Bank should periodically monetise a representative proportion of the assets in the stock 
through repo or outright sale, in order to test its access to the market, the effectiveness of its processes for 
monetisation, the availability of the assets, and to minimise the risk of negative signalling during a period of 
actual stress. 
28 
To avoid doubt, all assets maintained and held by the Reporting Bank for the purposes of section 40 of the 
Act are encumbered. For the purposes of Part II – LCR, cash balances maintained by the Reporting Bank for 
the purposes of section 39 of the Act are considered unencumbered. 
29 
For example, rents and salary. 


30 
 
(b) 
the liquid asset is under the control of the function30 charged with managing 
the liquidity of the Reporting Bank. In this regard, an asset would only be 
considered to be under the control of the function if the asset is maintained in 
a separate pool managed by the function with the sole intent for use as a 
source of contingent funds or if the Reporting Bank is able to demonstrate that 
the function has the authority and legal and operational capability to monetise 
the asset at any point in the 30-day LCR horizon and that the proceeds of doing 
so are available to the function throughout the 30-day LCR horizon without 
directly conflicting with a stated business or risk management strategy31; 
 
(c) 
in the case of a liquid asset received in reverse repo and securities financing 
transactions, the liquid asset has not been rehypothecated and is legally and 
contractually available for the Reporting Bank to sell or deal with such assets; 
 
(d) 
in the case of a liquid asset deposited with, or pledged to, a central bank or a 
PSE, the liquid asset has not been used to generate liquidity; 
 
(e) 
in the case of a liquid asset held by a banking group entity of the Reporting 
Bank to meet statutory liquidity requirements imposed on the banking group 
entity by the laws and regulations of any country or jurisdiction to which the 
banking group entity is subject to, the Reporting Bank includes the cash 
outflows and cash inflows of the banking group entity in its computation of its 
LCR, and the liquid asset in surplus of the statutory liquidity requirements, if 
any, is freely available to the banking group in times of stress; 
 
(f) 
in the case of a liquid asset received as collateral for derivatives transactions, 
the liquid asset is not segregated, has not been rehypothecated and is legally 
and contractually available for the Reporting Bank to sell or deal with such 
assets, and the Reporting Bank records an appropriate cash outflow for the 
associated risks in accordance with paragraph 88; 
 
(g) 
in the case of a liquid asset received as part of a basket of collateral as security 
for a transaction, the liquid asset can be monetised separately; 
 
(h) 
in the case of a liquid asset pledged as collateral, the liquid asset is unused as 
at the end of the day and is not intended to collateralise derivatives 
transactions. If the Reporting Bank is unable to determine which assets are 
unused, it must assume that the assets are encumbered in the following order: 
 
30 
For example, the treasurer. 
31 
For example, a Reporting Bank must exclude an asset which it is impeded from selling, such as an asset, 
which, if sold at large fire-sale discounts would cause the Reporting Bank to breach minimum solvency 
requirements, or an asset which the Reporting Bank is required to hold, including, but not limited to, an 
asset to meet statutory minimum inventory requirements for market making, from the stock of HQLA. 


31 
 
 
(i) 
firstly, assets that are not HQLA; 
 
(ii) 
secondly, Level 2B(II) HQLA; 
 
(iii) 
thirdly, Level 2B(I) HQLA; 
 
(iv) 
fourthly, Level 2A HQLA; 
 
(v) 
fifthly, Level 1 HQLA; 
 
(i) 
in the case of a liquid asset received as part of a securities borrowing 
transaction that is not a reverse repo or collateral swap, the liquid asset cannot 
be returned or recalled within the 30-day LCR horizon. 
 
Composition of HQLA 
 
32 
A Reporting Bank must measure its Level 1 HQLA at an amount not greater than the 
current market value. 
 
33 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that – 
 
(a) 
its Level 2A HQLA are subject to a 15% haircut on the current market value of 
each Level 2A HQLA; and 
 
(b) 
its Level 2B HQLA are subject to – 
 
(i) 
a 25% haircut on the current market value of RMBS; and 
 
(ii) 
a 50% haircut on the current market value of corporate debt securities 
(including commercial papers), sovereign debt securities, PSE debt 
securities and ordinary shares. 
 
34 
Where a liquid asset can be categorised into different categories of HQLA, a Reporting 
Bank must categorise the liquid asset into the HQLA category with the highest haircut, except 
where expressly provided otherwise or where the Reporting Bank has obtained the approval 
of the Authority to do otherwise.32 
 
35 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cap on its Level 2 HQLA, Level 2B HQLA and Level 2B(II) 
HQLA, to ensure that they do not exceed 40%, 15% and 5% of total HQLA respectively. The 
 
32 
A Reporting Bank may apply to the Authority for such approval with evidence supporting the less 
conservative treatment. 


32 
 
Reporting Bank must compute the cap on its Level 2 HQLA, Level 2B HQLA and Level 2B(II) 
HQLA after the application of the required haircuts, and after taking into account the 
unwinding of short-term securities financing transactions and collateral swap transaction 
maturing within the 30-day LCR horizon that involve the exchange of HQLA. 
 
36 
If a liquid asset no longer qualifies as HQLA33, a Reporting Bank is permitted to keep 
such liquid assets as HQLA for an additional 30 days. This would allow the Reporting Bank 
additional time to adjust its HQLA as needed or replace the liquid asset. 
 
37 
A Reporting Bank must compute HQLA in accordance with the formula in Appendix 6. 
 
Total net cash outflows 
 
38 
Total net cash outflows is defined as total expected cash outflows minus the lower of 
– 
 
(a) 
total expected cash inflows; and 
 
(b) 
75% of total expected cash outflows. 
 
39 
Except where otherwise stated, a Reporting Bank must compute – 
 
(a) 
total expected cash outflows as the sum of cash outflows of outflow items; and 
 
(b) 
total expected cash inflows as the sum of cash inflows of inflow items. 
 
40 
For the purposes of computing the total net cash outflows in paragraph 38, a 
Reporting Bank that is complying with Part II – LCR on a country-level group basis must 
exclude cash outflows and cash inflows arising from transactions between entities in a 
country-level group. 
 
41 
Except where otherwise stated, a Reporting Bank must compute cash outflows and 
cash inflows of outflow and inflow items by multiplying the cash outflow and cash inflow rates 
respectively to the outstanding balances of the outflow and inflow items due within the 30-
day LCR horizon. For the purposes of such computation, the Reporting Bank must apply the 
cash outflow and cash inflow rates in paragraphs 44 to 147 and Appendix 7 to each category 
of cash outflows and cash inflows. 
 
42 
A Reporting Bank must not double count assets and liabilities in its computation of its 
LCR. If a liquid asset is included as part of HQLA, the Reporting Bank cannot count the cash 
inflows associated with that liquid asset as part of the total expected cash inflows. 
 
33 
For example, due to a rating downgrade. 


33 
 
 
43 
Where transactions can be categorised into multiple categories with different cash 
inflow or cash outflow rates, a Reporting Bank must apply the higher cash outflow rate or 
lower cash inflow rate, as the case may be, except where expressly provided otherwise or 
where the Reporting Bank has obtained the approval of the Authority to do otherwise. 
 
Cash outflows 
 
(A) 
Retail deposit cash outflows 
 
44 
Retail deposits are deposits placed by a natural person. Deposits from legal entities, 
sole proprietorships or partnerships are captured in the wholesale funding categories. A 
Reporting Bank must include cash outflows from all retail deposits, including demand deposits 
and term deposits, in its computation of its LCR, unless otherwise excluded under the criteria 
set out in paragraphs 54 and 56. 
 
45 
Retail deposits are divided into “stable” and “less stable” as described in paragraphs 
46 and 52. 
 
(I) 
Stable deposits 
 
46 
Stable deposits are those which are fully insured by the Singapore Deposit Insurance 
Corporation Limited (“SDIC”), or an effective government deposit insurance scheme in a 
foreign country or jurisdiction, where – 
 
(a) 
the depositors have established relationships with the Reporting Bank such 
that the deposits are highly unlikely to be withdrawn (“established 
relationships”); or 
 
(b) 
the deposits are in transactional accounts34. 
 
47 
Fully insured deposits means the amount of deposits that will be fully paid out by an 
effective deposit insurance scheme. To avoid doubt, in the case of deposits that are in excess 
of the deposit insurance limit of the effective deposit insurance scheme, a Reporting Bank 
must treat only the amount of deposits up to the deposit insurance limit as fully insured and 
must not treat the amount of deposits in excess of the deposit insurance limit as fully insured. 
 
48 
Effective deposit insurance scheme means a scheme – 
 
(a) 
that has the ability to make prompt payouts; 
 
 
34 
For example, an account where salaries are automatically credited. 


34 
 
(b) 
that has a clearly defined coverage; 
 
(c) 
that has high public awareness; and 
 
(d) 
where the deposit insurer of the insurance scheme has formal legal powers to 
fulfil its mandate and is operationally independent, transparent and 
accountable. 
 
49 
A Reporting Bank may consider an explicit and legally binding sovereign deposit 
guarantee that effectively functions as deposit insurance as an effective deposit insurance 
scheme. 
 
50 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash outflow rate of 5% to stable deposits that are fully 
insured by SDIC. 
 
51 
Where a Reporting Bank has stable deposits that are fully insured by an effective 
government deposit insurance scheme in a foreign country or jurisdiction, the Reporting Bank 
must follow the relevant treatment adopted by the bank regulatory agency in the foreign 
country or jurisdiction. 
 
(II) 
Less stable deposits 
 
52 
Less stable deposits are deposits that are not stable deposits. 
 
53 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash outflow rate of 10% to less stable deposits. 
 
(III) 
Retail term deposits 
 
54 
Subject to paragraphs 55 and 56, a Reporting Bank must exclude the cash outflow 
from a retail term deposit with a residual maturity or withdrawal notice period of greater than 
30 days from the total expected cash outflows, if the depositor has no legal right to withdraw 
the deposit within the 30-day LCR horizon, or if early withdrawal results in a significant penalty 
that is materially greater than the loss of interest. 
 
55 
If a Reporting Bank allows a depositor to withdraw a retail term deposit referred to in 
paragraph 54 within the 30-day LCR horizon without applying any penalty that is materially 
greater than the loss of interest, or despite a clause that says the depositor has no legal right 
to withdraw, the Reporting Bank must include the cash outflow from all retail term deposits 
referred to in paragraph 54 in the total expected cash outflows as computed in accordance 
with paragraphs 46 to 53. 
 


35 
 
56 
Despite paragraph 55, if a Reporting Bank allows a depositor that is undergoing 
exceptional circumstances that would qualify as hardship35 to withdraw a retail term deposit 
referred to in paragraph 54 within the 30-day LCR horizon without applying any penalty that 
is materially greater than the loss of interest, or despite a clause that says the depositor has 
no legal right to withdraw, the Reporting Bank may continue to exclude the cash outflow from 
all retail term deposits referred to in paragraph 54 from the total expected cash outflows. 
 
57 
Where a Reporting Bank has a branch or subsidiary 36 that is approved, licensed, 
registered or otherwise regulated by a bank regulatory agency in a foreign country or 
jurisdiction to carry on banking business under the laws of the foreign country or jurisdiction, 
the Reporting Bank must apply the cash outflow and cash inflow rates outlined in Part II – LCR 
in its computation of its LCR, except for deposits from retail and small business customers 
where the Reporting Bank must follow the relevant treatment adopted in that country or 
jurisdiction, subject to the requirements in paragraph 148. 
 
(B) 
Unsecured wholesale funding cash outflows 
 
58 
Unsecured wholesale funding are liabilities and general obligations (excluding 
liabilities and obligations related to derivative contracts) of persons who are not natural 
persons and such liabilities and general obligations are not secured by legal rights to 
specifically designated assets owned by the person in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, 
liquidation or resolution of the person. 
 
59 
A Reporting Bank must include the cash outflow from an unsecured wholesale funding 
in the total expected cash outflows, if the funding is callable within the 30-day LCR horizon, 
has its earliest possible contractual maturity date situated within the 30-day LCR horizon37, 
has an undetermined maturity, or has options that are exercisable at the discretion of the 
counterparty to the unsecured wholesale funding transaction within the 30-day LCR horizon. 
For options exercisable at the Reporting Bank’s discretion, the Reporting Bank must consider 
reputational factors that may limit its ability not to exercise the option and its impact on 
unsecured wholesale funding cash outflows. 
 
60 
A Reporting Bank must not include unsecured wholesale funding that is callable by the 
counterparty to the unsecured wholesale funding transaction subject to a contractually 
defined and binding notice period surpassing the 30-day LCR horizon in the total expected 
cash outflows. 
 
 
35 
For example, loss of employment, entering into a serious accident or illness. 
36 
To avoid doubt, this includes a branch of the subsidiary. 
37 
For example, maturing term deposits and debt securities. 


36 
 
(I) 
Unsecured wholesale funding provided by small business customers 
 
61 
A Reporting Bank must treat unsecured wholesale funding provided by small business 
customers in the same way as retail deposits. 
 
(II) 
Operational deposits generated by clearing, custody and cash management 
services 
 
62 
Subject to paragraphs 63, 64, 65 and 68, a Reporting Bank may, with the Authority’s 
approval – 
 
(a) 
apply a cash outflow rate that is the same as the cash outflow rate applied to 
stable deposits, to the portion of operational deposits from customers 
receiving qualifying clearing, custody and cash management services from the 
Reporting Bank (“qualifying operational deposits”) that is fully covered by a 
deposit insurance scheme; and 
 
(b) 
apply a cash outflow rate of 25% to other qualifying operational deposits. 
 
63 
For the purposes of paragraph 62, a Reporting Bank must ensure that qualifying 
clearing, custody or cash management services meet the following criteria: 
 
(a) 
the customer is reliant on the Reporting Bank to perform these services as an 
independent third party intermediary in order to fulfil its normal banking 
activities over the 30-day LCR horizon38; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank is providing these services under a legally binding 
agreement to customers; 
 
(c) 
the customer may only terminate the agreement referred to in sub-paragraph 
(b) by giving prior notice of at least 30 days or paying significant switching 
costs 39  if the operational deposits are withdrawn within the 30-day LCR 
horizon. 
 
64 
For the purposes of paragraph 62, a Reporting Bank must ensure that qualifying 
operational deposits generated from the qualifying clearing, custody and cash management 
services meet the following criteria: 
 
 
38 
For example, this condition would not be met if the Reporting Bank is aware that the customer has adequate 
back-up arrangements. 
39 
For example, those related to transaction, information technology, early termination or legal costs. 


37 
 
(a) 
the deposits are by-products of the underlying services provided by the 
Reporting Bank and not sought out in the wholesale market in the sole interest 
of offering interest income; 
 
(b) 
the deposits are held in specifically designated accounts and priced without 
giving an economic incentive to the customer40 to leave any excess balances 
on these accounts. In the case that interest rates in a country or jurisdiction 
are close to zero, such accounts are likely to be non-interest bearing.41 
 
65 
For the purposes of paragraph 62, a Reporting Bank must not treat any excess 
balances that may be withdrawn while still leaving sufficient funds to fulfil the qualifying 
clearing, custody and cash management services as qualifying operational deposits. 
 
66 
For the purposes of paragraph 65, a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
determine the methodology for identifying excess balances that are excluded 
from this category; and 
 
(b) 
conduct an assessment based on the methodology at a sufficiently granular 
level to adequately assess the risk of withdrawal in an idiosyncratic stress. 
 
67 
For the purposes of the methodology referred to in paragraph 66(a), a Reporting Bank 
must ensure that the methodology takes into account relevant factors 42, and consider 
appropriate indicators43 to identify those customers that are not actively managing account 
balances efficiently. 
 
68 
For the purposes of paragraph 62, a Reporting Bank must not treat any deposit arising 
out of correspondent banking or from the provision of prime brokerage services as qualifying 
operational deposits. 
 
69 
Correspondent banking means any arrangement under which a bank or merchant 
bank (correspondent) holds deposits owned by another bank or merchant bank (respondent) 
and provides payment or other services to the respondent in order to settle foreign currency 
transactions.44 
 
40 
To avoid doubt, paying market interest rates for the deposits is not sufficient for the Reporting Bank to 
determine that the deposits are priced without giving an economic incentive to the customer. 
41 
The Reporting Bank should be particularly aware that during prolonged periods of low interest rates, excess 
balances could be significant. 
42 
For example, the likelihood that wholesale customers have above average balances in advance of specific 
payment needs. 
43 
For example, ratios of account balances to payment or settlement volumes or to assets under custody. 
44 
For example, nostro and vostro accounts used to settle transactions in a currency other than the domestic 
currency of the respondent bank or merchant bank for the provision of clearing and settlement of payments. 


38 
 
 
70 
Prime brokerage services is a package of services45 offered to large active investors46. 
 
(III) 
Deposits in institutional networks of cooperative banks 
 
71 
An institutional network of cooperative (or otherwise named) banks is a group of 
legally autonomous banks with a statutory framework of cooperation with common strategic 
focus and brand where specific functions are performed by central institutions or specialised 
service providers. Subject to paragraph 72, a Reporting Bank that is a central institution or a 
specialised service provider of an institutional network of cooperative banks, may, with the 
Authority’s approval, apply a cash outflow rate of 25% to the amount of deposits that 
members of the institutional network have placed with the Reporting Bank arising from 
statutory minimum deposit requirements or in the context of common task sharing and legal, 
statutory or contractual arrangements, so long as both the Reporting Bank that has received 
the deposits and the member of the institutional network that has placed the deposits 
participate in the same institutional network’s mutual protection scheme against illiquidity 
and insolvency of its members. 
 
72 
Despite paragraph 71, a Reporting Bank that is a central institution or a specialised 
service provider of an institutional network of cooperative banks, must apply a cash outflow 
rate of 100% to the amount of deposits that members of the institutional network have placed 
with the Reporting Bank for – 
 
(a) 
correspondent banking services; and 
 
(b) 
clearing, custody or cash management services. 
 
(IV) 
Deposits contractually pledged to a Reporting Bank as collateral to secure 
other transactions 
 
73 
Despite paragraphs 44 to 72, if a deposit is contractually pledged to a Reporting Bank 
as collateral to secure a credit facility or loan granted by the Reporting Bank (“pledged 
deposit”) that will not mature or settle within the 30-day LCR horizon, the Reporting Bank 
may exclude the pledged deposit from its computation of its LCR only if the following 
conditions are met: 
 
(a) 
the loan or credit facility is not maturing within the 30-day LCR horizon; 
 
 
45 For example, clearing, settlement and custody, consolidated reporting, financing (margin, repo or synthetic), 
securities lending, capital introduction, and risk analytics. 
46 
For example, institutional hedge funds. 


39 
 
(b) 
there is a legally enforceable contract disallowing withdrawal of the pledged 
deposit before the loan is fully settled or repaid; 
 
(c) 
the amount of deposit that is excluded from its computation of its LCR does 
not exceed the outstanding balance of the loan or drawn portion of the credit 
facility. 
 
74 
Paragraph 73 does not apply to a deposit that is pledged against an undrawn facility, 
in which case the Reporting Bank must apply the higher of the cash outflow rate applicable 
to the undrawn facility and the pledged deposit. 
 
(V) 
Unsecured wholesale funding provided by non-financial corporates and 
sovereigns, central banks, multilateral development banks and PSEs 
 
75 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash outflow rate of 20% to unsecured wholesale 
funding provided by corporate customers which are not financial institutions, sovereigns, 
central banks, multilateral development banks, and PSEs, that also do not qualify as 
operational deposits, if the entire amount of the deposit is fully covered by an effective 
deposit insurance scheme or by a public guarantee that provides equivalent protection. 
Otherwise, the Reporting Bank must apply a cash outflow rate of 40% to such unsecured 
wholesale funding. 
 
(VI) 
Unsecured wholesale funding provided by other customers that are not 
natural persons 
 
76 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash outflow rate of 100% to all unsecured wholesale 
funding that are not included in paragraphs 58 to 7547. Subject to paragraph 77, a Reporting 
Bank may compute cash outflows from unsecured wholesale funding provided by relevant 
intragroup banking entities on a net basis with cash inflows from unsecured wholesale 
funding provided to such entities. 
 
77 
Despite paragraph 76, a Reporting Bank that is an internationally active bank must not, 
in its computation of its LCR at the Group level, compute cash outflows from unsecured 
wholesale funding provided by relevant intragroup banking entities on a net basis with cash 
inflows from unsecured wholesale funding provided to such entities. 
 
78 
A Reporting Bank must include all notes, bonds and other debt securities issued by the 
Reporting Bank in this category regardless of the holder, unless the bond is sold exclusively in 
the retail market and held in retail accounts (including small business customer accounts), in 
 
47 
For example, deposits and other funding, that are not qualifying operational deposits, from banks, securities 
firms, insurance companies, fiduciaries, beneficiaries, conduits and special purpose vehicles, affiliated 
entities of the Reporting Bank and other entities. 


40 
 
which case the Reporting Bank may include the notes, bonds or debt securities in the 
appropriate retail or small business customer deposit category provided that limitations are 
placed on the instrument by the Reporting Bank such that those instruments cannot be 
bought and held by parties other than retail or small business customers. 
 
79 
A Reporting Bank must separate customer cash balances arising from the provision of 
prime brokerage services, including but not limited to the cash arising from prime brokerage 
services, from any required segregated balances related to customer protection regimes 
imposed on the Reporting Bank or its banking group entities by the laws and regulations of 
any country or jurisdiction to which the Reporting Bank or its banking group entities is subject 
and the Reporting Bank must not net such cash balances against other customer exposures 
included in its computation of its LCR. A Reporting Bank must treat segregated balances 
related to customer protection regimes imposed by the laws and regulations of any country 
or jurisdiction to which the Reporting Bank or its banking group entities is subject as cash 
inflows in accordance with paragraph 133 and must exclude these segregated balances from 
HQLA. 
 
(C) 
Unsecured precious metals liabilities cash outflows 
 
80 
Unsecured precious metals liabilities are liabilities and general obligations (excluding 
liabilities and obligations related to derivative contracts) in precious metals and are not 
secured funding.48 
 
81 
A Reporting Bank must treat unsecured precious metals liabilities in the same way as 
retail deposits and unsecured wholesale funding, and apply the appropriate cash outflow 
rates in accordance with paragraphs 44 to 79. 
 
82 
Despite paragraph 81, a Reporting Bank may apply a cash outflow rate of 0% to an 
unsecured precious metals liability if – 
 
(a) 
contractual arrangements require the unsecured precious metals liability to be 
settled by physical delivery and the Reporting Bank is able to supply the 
precious metals from its own inventories; or 
 
(b) 
contractual arrangements allow the Reporting Bank to choose cash settlement 
or physical delivery and there are no market practices or reputational factors 
that may limit the Reporting Bank’s ability to choose physical delivery if the 
Reporting Bank is able to supply the precious metals from its own inventories. 
 
 
48 
For example, deposits in precious metals received by a Reporting Bank. 


41 
 
(D) 
Secured funding cash outflows 
 
83 
Secured funding are liabilities and general obligations that are collateralised by legal 
rights to specifically designated assets owned by the borrowing institution in the case of 
bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or resolution of the borrowing institution. 
 
84 
A Reporting Bank must include forward repurchase transactions and collateral swaps 
that start prior to, but mature within, the 30-day LCR horizon in this category. 
 
85 
A Reporting Bank must treat collateral swaps and any other transaction which involves 
an exchange of non-cash assets as a combination of a repurchase and reverse repurchase 
agreement. The Reporting Bank must compute the cash outflow for collateral swaps based 
on the net cash outflow that will result from an equivalent repurchase and reverse repurchase 
transaction, floored at zero. The Reporting Bank must treat any collateral lent to its customers 
to effect short positions as a form of secured funding. 
 
86 
If a pool of assets is used as collateral for a secured funding transaction, and a 
Reporting Bank is unable to determine specifically which assets are used to collateralise the 
transaction, it must assume that the assets are encumbered in the following order: 
 
(a) 
firstly, assets which are not HQLA; 
 
(b) 
secondly, Level 2B(II) HQLA; 
 
(c) 
thirdly, Level 2B(I) HQLA; 
 
(d) 
fourthly, Level 2A HQLA; 
 
(e) 
fifthly, Level 1 HQLA. 
 
87 
A Reporting Bank must apply the relevant cash outflow rates in “Cash Outflows – C. 
Secured funding” section of Appendix 7 to the amount of funds raised through an outstanding 
secured funding transaction that matures within the 30-day LCR horizon or that arises from 
collateral lent to customers to effect short positions without a specified contractual maturity. 
 
(E) 
Additional requirements 
 
(I) 
Cash outflows from derivative contracts 
 
88 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
apply a cash outflow rate of 100% to the sum of all cash outflows from 
derivative contracts; and 


42 
 
 
(b) 
compute the amounts of cash outflows from derivative contracts by doing the 
following: 
 
(i) 
compute such amounts in accordance with its existing valuation 
methodologies; 
 
(ii) 
exclude from such computations those liquidity requirements that 
would result from increased collateral needs due to market value 
movements or fall in value of collateral posted by the Reporting Bank; 
 
(iii) 
assume that options are exercised at the point when they are ‘in the 
money’ to the option buyer. 
 
89 
A Reporting Bank may – 
 
(a) 
where the Reporting Bank has entered into a valid master netting agreement 
with its counterparty, compute the cash outflows from derivative contracts 
with that counterparty on a net basis with cash inflows from derivative 
contracts with the same counterparty; and 
 
(b) 
for the purposes of its computation of its all currency LCR, compute the cash 
outflows from a foreign exchange derivative contract not covered by a master 
netting agreement, where the foreign exchange derivative contract involves a 
full exchange of principal amounts within the same day, on a net basis with 
cash inflows from the foreign exchange derivative contract. 
 
90 
Where derivative contracts are collateralised by HQLA, a Reporting Bank must 
compute the cash outflows from derivative contracts net of any corresponding cash or 
collateral inflows that would result, all other things being equal, from contractual obligations 
for cash or collateral to be provided to the Reporting Bank, if the Reporting Bank is legally 
entitled to, and is operationally capable of, re-using the collateral in new cash raising 
transactions once the collateral is received. 
 
91 
A Reporting Bank must treat options which must be settled by physical delivery as 
secured borrowing transactions, where the assets to be delivered are treated as collateral in 
secured transactions or collateral swaps, and apply the appropriate cash outflow rates in 
accordance with paragraphs 83 to 87. The Reporting Bank may assume cash settlement, if 
contractual arrangements allow for both physical delivery and cash settlement. Where 
contractual arrangements require physical delivery as the mode of settlement, the Reporting 
Bank may assume that the security of lowest value will be delivered, unless the derivative 
contract provides otherwise. 
 


43 
 
(II) 
Increased liquidity needs related to downgrade triggers embedded in 
financing transactions, derivatives and other contracts 
 
92 
For each contract in which downgrade triggers exist, a Reporting Bank must include, 
in its computation of its total expected cash outflows, 100% of the additional collateral or 
cash outflow as stated in the governing contract to be posted for any downgrade during the 
30-day LCR horizon up to and including a 3-notch downgrade of the Reporting Bank’s long-
term credit rating. For the purposes of this paragraph, where a downgrade trigger is linked to 
the Reporting Bank’s short-term rating, the Reporting Bank must map such short-term rating 
to the corresponding long-term rating in accordance with published ratings criteria. The 
Reporting Bank must consider impacts on all types of margin collateral and contractual 
triggers which change rehypothecation rights for non-segregated collateral for the impact of 
the downgrade. 
 
93 
For the purposes of paragraph 92, downgrade triggers are clauses that require the 
posting of additional collateral, drawdown of contingent facilities, or early repayment of 
existing liabilities, upon a downgrade of the Reporting Bank’s credit rating by a recognised 
ECAI. 
 
(III) 
Increased liquidity needs related to the potential for valuation changes on 
posted collateral securing derivative and other transactions49 
 
94 
Where a Reporting Bank posts Level 1 HQLA as collateral in respect of a derivative 
transaction, the Reporting Bank is not required to maintain additional HQLA for potential 
valuation changes. If however, the Reporting Bank posts other forms of collateral to cover the 
potential loss of market value on those securities, the Reporting Bank must include, in its 
computation of its total expected cash outflows, a cash outflow equivalent to 20% of the value 
of all such posted collateral, net of collateral received on a counterparty basis (provided that 
the collateral received is not subject to restrictions on reuse or rehypothecation). The 
Reporting Bank must compute the 20% based on the notional amount required to be posted 
as collateral after any other haircuts have been applied that may be applicable to the 
collateral category. The Reporting Bank must only use collateral that is in a segregated margin 
account to offset collateral outflows that are associated with payments that are eligible to be 
offset from that same account. The Reporting Bank must compute the notional amount to be 
collateralised based on the contractual terms of the transaction. The Reporting Bank must 
not net collateral inflows and collateral outflows across counterparties. The Reporting Bank 
must compute the amount of collateral to be posted in accordance with the relevant contract 
governing the respective transactions. 
 
 
49 
Counterparties in derivatives and other transactions are typically required to post collateral to secure the 
marked-to-market valuations of their positions. These counterparties are then required to post additional 
collateral should the value of the posted collateral fall. 


44 
 
(IV) 
Increased liquidity needs related to excess non-segregated collateral held by 
the Reporting Bank that could contractually be called at any time by the 
counterparty 
 
95 
A Reporting Bank must include, in its computation of its total expected cash outflows, 
a cash outflow equivalent to 100% of the amount of non-segregated collateral that could 
contractually be recalled by the counterparty because the collateral is in excess of the 
counterparty’s current collateral requirements, and compute the amount that can be recalled 
in accordance with the relevant contract governing the transactions. 
 
(V) 
Increased liquidity needs related to contractually required collateral on 
transactions for which the counterparty has not yet demanded the collateral 
be posted 
 
96 
A Reporting Bank must include, in its computation of its total expected cash outflows, 
a cash outflow equivalent to 100% of the amount of collateral that is contractually due but 
where the counterparty has not yet demanded the posting of such collateral, and compute 
the amount of collateral in accordance with the relevant contract governing the transactions. 
 
(VI) 
Increased liquidity needs related to contracts that allow collateral 
substitution to assets that are not HQLA or lower-quality HQLA 
 
97 
Where a Reporting Bank has received HQLA collateral that is – 
 
(a) 
not segregated; and 
 
(b) 
can be substituted with lower-quality HQLA or assets that are not HQLA 
without the Reporting Bank’s consent in accordance with the relevant contract 
governing the transactions, including for secured lending transactions 
maturing beyond the 30-day LCR horizon that allows such collateral 
substitution, 
 
the Reporting Bank must include, in its computation of its total expected cash outflows, 
a cash outflow equivalent to the market value of the received HQLA collateral 
multiplied by the difference in haircuts (as defined in paragraph 33) of the received 
HQLA collateral and the potential substitute collateral. 
 


45 
 
(VII) 
Increased liquidity needs related to market valuation changes on derivative 
or other transactions50 
 
98 
A Reporting Bank must include, in its computation of its total expected cash outflows, 
a cash outflow equivalent to the largest absolute net 30-day collateral flow realised during 
the preceding 24 months. 
 
99 
For the purposes of paragraph 98, the Reporting Bank must compute the absolute net 
30-day collateral flow for a 30-day period by doing the following: 
 
(a) 
compute the absolute net 30-day collateral flow based on both realised 
collateral outflows and collateral inflows during the 30-day period, including 
payments and receipts which are deemed to settle outstanding exposures 
from exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives structured as 
“settled-to-market”; 
 
(b) 
assess the absolute net 30-day collateral flow on a portfolio level. 
 
(VIII) Loss of funding on asset-backed securities, covered bonds and other 
structured financing instruments 
 
100 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash outflow rate of 100% to all asset-backed securities, 
covered bonds and other structured financing instruments issued by the Reporting Bank that 
are maturing within the 30-day LCR horizon. For the purposes of this computation, the 
Reporting Bank may offset inflows from Level 1 or Level 2 HQLA used as collateral for these 
issuances against the redemption payment of these issuances. The Reporting Bank must 
consider any net inflow as other contractual cash inflows in paragraph 118 146. 
 
[MAS Notice 649 (Amendment) 2024] 
 
(IX) 
Loss of funding on asset-backed commercial papers, conduits, securities 
investment vehicles and other such financing facilities 
 
101 
A Reporting Bank that has structured financing facilities that include the issuance of 
short-term debt instruments51, must fully consider the potential liquidity risk52 arising from 
 
50 
As market practice requires collateralisation of marked-to-market exposures on derivative and other 
transactions, a Reporting Bank faces potentially substantial liquidity risk exposures to these valuation 
changes. 
51 
For example, asset backed commercial papers. 
52 
These risks include the inability of the Reporting Bank to refinance maturing debt, and the existence of 
derivatives or derivative-like components contractually written into the documentation associated with the 
structure that would allow the “return” of assets in a financing arrangement, or that require the original 
 


46 
 
these structures. Where the structured financing activities of the Reporting Bank are 
conducted through a special purpose entity53, the Reporting Bank must look through to the 
maturity of the debt instruments issued by the entity and any embedded options in financing 
arrangements that may potentially trigger the “return” of assets or the need for liquidity, 
irrespective of whether or not the SPV is consolidated. 
 
Table 1: Cash outflow rates from potential risk elements

(X) 
Drawdowns on committed credit and liquidity facilities 
 
102 
Committed facilities are defined as explicit contractual agreements or obligations to 
extend funds at a future date to retail or wholesale counterparties, which are contractually 
irrevocable or conditionally revocable agreements. 
 
103 
A Reporting Bank must compute the undrawn portion of the committed facilities net 
of any HQLA that have already been posted as collateral by the counterparty to secure the 
facilities or that are contractually obliged to be posted when the counterparty draws down 
the facility54. This is provided that the Reporting Bank is legally entitled to and operationally 
capable of, re-using the collateral in new cash raising transactions once the facility is drawn, 
and there is no undue correlation between the probability of drawing the facility and the 
market value of the collateral. The Reporting Bank may net the collateral against the 
outstanding amount of the facility to the extent that this collateral is not already counted in 
the stock of HQLA. 
 
104 
A committed liquidity facility is defined as any committed, undrawn back-up facility 
that would be utilised to refinance the debt obligations of a customer in situations where such 
a customer is unable to rollover that debt in financial markets55. A Reporting Bank must treat 
the amount of commitment that backs currently outstanding debt issued by the customer (or 
proportionate share, if a syndicated facility) maturing within the 30-day LCR horizon as a 
committed liquidity facility. 
 
 
asset transferor to provide liquidity, effectively ending the financing arrangement (“liquidity puts”) within 
the 30-day LCR horizon. 
53 
For example, a special purpose vehicle (“SPV”), conduit or structured investment vehicle (“SIV”). 
54 
For example, a liquidity facility structured as a repo facility. 
55 
For example, pursuant to commercial paper programmes, secured financing transactions or obligations to 
redeem units. 


47 
 
105 
Subject to paragraph 106, a Reporting Bank must treat the following as committed 
credit facilities: 
 
(a) 
any additional capacity of a committed facility that is not meant to be utilised 
to refinance the debt obligations of a customer in situations where such a 
customer is unable to rollover that debt in financial markets; and 
 
(b) 
general working capital facilities for corporate entities56. 
 
106 
Despite paragraphs 104 and 105, a Reporting Bank must treat any committed facility 
provided to hedge funds, money market funds and special purpose funding vehicles or 
conduits, or other vehicles used to finance the Reporting Bank’s own assets as a committed 
liquidity facility to other legal entities. 
 
107 
For the portion of financing programs issued by a Reporting Bank that are captured 
under paragraphs 100 and 101 (i.e. are maturing or have liquidity puts that may be exercised 
within the 30-day LCR horizon), the Reporting Bank that is the provider of the associated 
liquidity facilities does not need to double count the maturing financing instrument and the 
liquidity facility for consolidated programs. 
 
108 
A Reporting Bank must apply the following cash outflow rates to any contractual and 
estimated loan drawdowns from a committed facility within the 30-day LCR horizon, 
regardless of the maturity of the facility57: 
 
(a) 
committed credit and liquidity facilities to retail and small business customers: 
5% of the undrawn portion of these facilities; 
 
(b) 
committed credit facilities to non-financial corporates, sovereigns and central 
banks, PSEs and multilateral development banks: 10% of the undrawn portion 
of these credit facilities; 
 
(c) 
committed liquidity facilities to non-financial corporates, sovereigns and 
central banks, PSEs, and multilateral development banks: 30% of the undrawn 
portion of these liquidity facilities; 
 
 
56 
For example, revolving credit facilities in place for general corporate or working capital purposes. 
57 
Committed facilities can have long-term or short-term maturities, with short-term facilities frequently 
renewing or automatically rolling-over. In a stressed environment, it will likely be difficult for customers 
drawing on committed facilities of any maturity, even short-term maturities, to be able to quickly pay back 
the borrowings. Therefore, any contractual and estimated loan drawdowns from a committed facility within 
the 30-day LCR horizon are assumed to remain outstanding throughout the 30-day LCR horizon without any 
repayment, regardless of the maturity of the facility. 


48 
 
(d) 
committed credit and liquidity facilities extended to banks, and merchant 
banks in Singapore, subject to prudential supervision: 40% of the undrawn 
portion of these facilities; 
 
(e) 
committed credit facilities to other financial institutions including securities 
firms, insurance companies, fiduciaries, and beneficiaries: 40% of the undrawn 
portion of these credit facilities; 
 
(f) 
committed liquidity facilities to other financial institutions including securities 
firms, insurance companies, fiduciaries, and beneficiaries: 100% of the 
undrawn portion of these liquidity facilities; 
 
(g) 
committed credit and liquidity facilities to other legal entities (including SPEs, 
conduits and special purpose vehicles, and other entities not included in the 
prior categories): 100% of the undrawn portion of these facilities. 
 
(XI) 
Contractual obligations to extend funds within the 30-day LCR horizon 
 
109 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash outflow rate of 100% to any contractual lending 
obligation to financial institutions not captured elsewhere in Part II – LCR. 
 
110 
If the total of all contractual obligations to extend funds to customers that are not 
financial institutions within the 30-day LCR horizon not captured elsewhere in Part II – LCR 
exceeds 50% of the total contractual cash inflows due in the 30-day LCR horizon from these 
customers, a Reporting Bank must report the difference at a cash outflow rate of 100%. 
 
(XII) 
Other contingent funding obligations58 
 
111 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash outflow rate of 100% to the full amount of the 
contingent funding obligations that is expected to materialise within the 30-day LCR horizon 
under stressed conditions. 
 
112 
A Reporting Bank must treat all of the following as contingent funding obligations:  
 
 
58 
Contingent funding obligations may be either contractual or non-contractual and are not lending 
commitments. Non-contractual contingent funding obligations include associations with, or sponsorship of, 
products sold or services provided that may require the support or extension of funds in the future under 
stressed conditions. Non-contractual obligations may be embedded in financial products and instruments 
sold, sponsored, or originated by the institution that can give rise to unplanned balance sheet growth arising 
from support given for reputational risk considerations. These include products and instruments for which 
the customer or holder has specific expectations regarding the liquidity and marketability of the product or 
instrument and for which failure to satisfy customer expectations in a commercially reasonable manner 
would likely cause material reputational damage to the institution or otherwise impair ongoing viability. 


49 
 
(a)  
facilities that are unconditionally revocable by the Reporting Bank (in 
particular, those without a precondition of a material change in the credit 
condition of the borrower); 
 
(b) 
debt instruments issued by the Reporting Bank that mature if a pre-
determined market-based event occurs at a pre-determined date58A as 
contingent funding obligations. 
 
[MAS Notice 649 (Amendment) 2024] 
 
113 
Where a Reporting Bank has identified any contingent funding obligations that are 
explicitly contingent upon an event that is not related to a liquidity event, including debt 
instruments issued by the Reporting Bank that mature if a pre-determined market-based 
event occurs at a pre-determined date58B, the Reporting Bank must inform the Authority not 
later than the last day of the calendar year in which such contingent funding obligation is 
identified. 
 
[MAS Notice 649 (Amendment) 2024] 
 
114 
A Reporting Bank must treat non-contractual contingent funding obligations related 
to potential liquidity draws from joint ventures or investments in entities, which are not 
consolidated, as contingent funding obligations where there is the expectation that the 
Reporting Bank will be the main liquidity provider when the entity is in need of liquidity. The 
Reporting Bank must seek the Authority’s approval for the methodology for quantifying such 
potential liquidity draws, in particular, those arising from the need to support investments in 
times of stress out of reputational concerns. 
 
115 
For contingent funding obligations stemming from trade finance instruments59 that 
are not lending commitments, a Reporting Bank must apply a cash outflow rate of 3%. 
 
116 
For contingent funding obligations stemming from trade finance instruments that are 
lending commitments60, a Reporting Bank must apply the cash outflow rates specified in 
paragraph 108 for such commitments. 
 
 
58A  For example, autocallable notes. 
[MAS Notice 649 (Amendment) 2024] 
58B  For example, autocallable notes. 
[MAS Notice 649 (Amendment) 2024] 
59 
Trade finance instruments consist of trade-related obligations, directly underpinned by the movement of 
goods or the provision of services, such as – 
(a) documentary trade letters of credit, documentary and clean collection, import bills and export bills; and 
(b) guarantees directly related to trade finance obligations, such as shipping guarantees. 
60 
For example, direct import or export financing for non-financial corporates. 


50 
 
117 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash outflow rate of 50% to contingent obligations 
where the Reporting Bank has covered customers’ short positions using other customers’ 
collateral which does not qualify as Level 1 or Level 2 HQLA, and the Reporting Bank may be 
obligated to find additional sources of funding for these positions in the event of customers’ 
withdrawals. 
 
(F) 
Other contractual cash outflows 
 
118 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash outflow rate of 100% to all other contractual cash 
outflows within the 30-day LCR horizon, where such cash outflows are not captured 
elsewhere in Part II – LCR61, except for cash outflows related to operating costs. The Reporting 
Bank must, if called upon at any time by the Authority, explain to the Authority, what these 
cash outflows are. 
 
Cash inflows 
 
119 
When considering its available cash inflows, a Reporting Bank must only include 
contractual cash inflows (including interest payments) from outstanding exposures that are 
fully performing and for which the Reporting Bank has no reason to expect a default within 
the 30-day LCR horizon. The Reporting Bank must not include contingent inflows in total net 
cash inflows. 
 
(A) 
Cap on total expected cash inflows 
 
120 
A Reporting Bank must, in its computation of its total net cash outflows, cap the 
amount of total expected cash inflows that can offset the amount of total expected cash 
outflows at 75% of the amount of total expected cash outflows, in accordance with paragraph 
38. 
 
(B) 
Secured lending, including reverse repos, securities borrowing and margin loans 
 
121 
Subject to paragraph 123, for reverse repurchase or securities borrowing agreements 
that are maturing within the 30-day LCR horizon, a Reporting Bank must apply the following 
cash inflow rates: 
 
(a) 
if the agreement is secured by Level 1 HQLA, 0%; 
 
(b) 
if the agreement is secured by Level 2 HQLA, the relevant haircut for the 
specific HQLA as set out in paragraph 33; or 
 
 
61 
For example, cash outflows to cover unsecured collateral borrowings, uncovered short positions, dividends 
or contractual interest payments. 


51 
 
(c) 
if the agreement is secured by assets that are not HQLA, 100%. 
 
122 
Subject to paragraph 123, a Reporting Bank must treat collateralised loans extended 
to customers for the purposes of taking leveraged trading positions (“margin loans”) as 
secured lending, and must apply the cash inflow rates in paragraph 121 to margin loans 
maturing within the 30-day LCR horizon, except in the case of margin loans secured by assets 
that are not HQLA, to which the Reporting Bank must apply a cash inflow rate of 50%. 
 
123 
Despite paragraphs 121 and 122, if the collateral obtained through reverse repurchase, 
securities borrowing, margin loans or collateral swaps is used to cover short positions that 
could be extended beyond the 30-day LCR horizon, a Reporting Bank must assume that such 
reverse repurchase or securities borrowing arrangements will be rolled-over and apply a cash 
inflow rate of 0%, reflecting the need to continue to cover the short position or to re-purchase 
the relevant securities.

124 
Where a Reporting Bank’s short position is being covered by an unsecured security 
borrowing, the Reporting Bank must assume the unsecured security borrowing of collateral 
from financial market participants would run-off in full, leading to a 100% outflow of either 
cash or HQLA to secure the borrowing, or cash to close out the short position by buying back 
the security, and apply a cash outflow rate of 100% in accordance with paragraph 118 to the 


52 
 
short position. Where the Reporting Bank’s short position is being covered by a collateralised 
securities financing transaction, the Reporting Bank must assume the short position will be 
maintained throughout the 30-day LCR horizon and apply a cash inflow rate of 0% to the short 
position. 
 
125 
If a pool of assets is used as collateral for a secured lending transaction, and a 
Reporting Bank is unable to determine specifically which assets are used to collateralise the 
transaction, the Reporting Bank must assume that the assets are encumbered in the following 
order: 
 
(a) 
firstly, assets that are not HQLA; 
 
(b) 
secondly, Level 2B(II) HQLA; 
 
(c) 
thirdly, Level 2B(I) HQLA; 
 
(d) 
fourthly, Level 2A HQLA; 
 
(e) 
fifthly, Level 1 HQLA. 
 
126 
Despite paragraphs 121 to 123, a Reporting Bank must manage its collateral such that 
it is able to fulfil obligations to return collateral whenever the counterparty decides not to 
roll-over any reverse repo or securities lending transaction. 
 
127 
A Reporting Bank must include forward reverse repurchase transactions and collateral 
swaps that start prior to, but mature within, the 30-day LCR horizon in this category. 
 
128 
Paragraphs 121 to 127 do not apply to any transaction where there is a possibility of 
the cash inflow occurring after the 30-day LCR horizon. 
 
(C) 
Committed facilities 
 
129 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash inflow rate of 0% to credit facilities, liquidity 
facilities or other contingent funding facilities that the Reporting Bank holds at other 
institutions for its own purposes. 
 
(D) 
Other cash inflows by counterparty 
 
130 
A Reporting Bank must, in relation to loan payments, include, in its computation of its 
total expected cash inflows, only cash inflows from fully performing loans. A Reporting Bank 
must include, in its computation of its total expected cash inflows, only cash inflows at the 
latest possible date based on the contractual rights available to counterparties. A Reporting 
Bank must, in relation to revolving credit facilities, assume that the existing loan will be rolled 


53 
 
over and any remaining balances are treated as a committed facility in accordance with 
paragraph 108. 
 
131 
A Reporting Bank must not include, in its computation of its total expected cash 
inflows, cash inflows from loans that have no specific maturity, except for minimum payments 
of principal, fee or interest associated with open maturity loans that are contractually due 
within the 30-day LCR horizon. The Reporting Bank must capture these minimum payment 
amounts as cash inflows at the cash inflow rates in paragraphs 132 and 133. 
 
(I) 
Retail and small business customer cash inflows 
 
132 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
assume that all payments (including interest payments and instalments) from 
retail and small business customers that are fully performing and contractually 
due within the 30-day LCR horizon will be received in full; 
 
(b) 
assume that it will continue extending loans to retail and small business 
customers at a rate of 50% of contractual cash inflows; and 
 
(c) 
apply a cash inflow rate of 50% to the contractual cash inflows from retail and 
small business customers as a result of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b). 
 
(II) 
Other wholesale cash inflows 
 
133 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
assume that all payments (including interest payments and instalments) 
received from wholesale customers that are fully performing and contractually 
due within the 30-day LCR horizon will be received in full; 
 
(b) 
assume that it will continue extending loans to wholesale customers at a rate 
of 0% of contractual cash inflows from financial institutions and central banks, 
and at a rate of 50% of contractual cash inflows from other wholesale 
customers62; and 
 
(c) 
apply a cash inflow rate of 100% to the contractual cash inflows from financial 
institutions and central bank counterparties, and 50% to the contractual cash 
inflows from other wholesale customers, as a result of sub-paragraphs (a) and 
(b). 
 
 
62 
This includes non-financial corporates, sovereigns, multilateral development banks, and PSEs. 


54 
 
134 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash inflow rate of 100% to cash inflows from securities 
maturing within the 30-day LCR horizon that are not HQLA. 
 
135 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash inflow rate of 0% to operational deposits of the 
Reporting Bank placed with other financial institutions for operational purposes. A Reporting 
Bank that is a member of an institutional network of cooperative banks must apply a cash 
inflow rate of 0% to deposits placed with a central institution or a specialised service provider 
in the institutional network arising from statutory minimum deposit requirements or in the 
context of common task sharing and legal, statutory or contractual arrangements, so long as 
both the Reporting Bank that has placed the deposits and the central institution or the 
specialised service provider of the institutional network that has received the deposits 
participate in the same institutional network’s mutual protection scheme against illiquidity 
and insolvency of its members. Where a Reporting Bank has placed a deposit with a bank or 
financial institution (the “receiving financial institution”), the Reporting Bank must apply the 
methodology in paragraphs 62 to 70 to determine if these deposits are operational deposits.63 
 
136 
Subject to paragraph 137, where a Reporting Bank has elected to compute the cash 
outflows from unsecured wholesale funding provided by relevant intragroup banking entities 
on a net basis with cash inflows from unsecured wholesale funding provided to such entities 
in accordance with paragraph 76, the Reporting Bank must compute cash inflows from 
unsecured wholesale funding provided to the same relevant intragroup banking entities on a 
net basis with cash outflows from unsecured wholesale funding provided by such entities. 
 
137 
Despite paragraph 136, a Reporting Bank that is an internationally active bank must 
not, in its computation of its LCR at the Group level, compute cash inflows from unsecured 
wholesale funding provided to relevant intragroup banking entities on a net basis with cash 
outflows from unsecured wholesale funding provided by such entities. 
 
(E) 
Unsecured precious metals assets cash inflows 
 
138 
Unsecured precious metals assets are assets (excluding assets related to derivative 
contracts) in precious metals and are not secured lending.64 
 
139 
A Reporting Bank must treat cash inflows from unsecured precious metals assets that 
must be settled by cash settlement in the same way as loans to retail customers and 
wholesale customers, and apply the appropriate cash inflow rates in accordance with 
paragraphs 132 and 133. 
 
 
63 
As a general principle, if the deposit has been classified by the receiving financial institution as an 
operational deposit, the Reporting Bank should also consider the deposit as an operational deposit. 
64 
For example, unsecured loans in precious metals extended by a Reporting Bank or deposits in precious 
metals placed by a Reporting Bank. 


55 
 
140 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash inflow rate of 0% to unsecured precious metals 
assets that must be settled by physical delivery or where contractual arrangements allow the 
Reporting Bank to choose cash settlement or physical delivery. 
 
141 
Despite paragraph 140, a Reporting Bank may treat cash inflows from an unsecured 
precious metals asset referred to in paragraph 140 in the same way as loans to retail 
customers and wholesale customers, and apply the appropriate cash inflow rates in 
accordance with paragraphs 132 and 133, if – 
 
(a) 
contractual arrangements allow the Reporting Bank to choose between cash 
settlement and physical delivery and – 
 
(i) 
physical delivery results in a significant penalty; or 
 
(ii) 
both parties expect cash settlement; and 
 
(b) 
there are no market practices or reputational factors that may limit the 
Reporting Bank’s ability to choose cash settlement. 
 
(F) 
Other cash inflows 
 
(I) 
Cash inflows from derivative contracts 
 
142 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
apply a cash inflow rate of 100% to the sum of all cash inflows from derivative 
contracts; and 
 
(b) 
compute the amounts of cash inflows from derivative contracts by doing the 
following: 
 
(i) 
compute such amounts in accordance with its existing valuation 
methodologies; 
 
(ii) 
assume that options are exercised at the point when they are ‘in the 
money’ to the option buyer. 
 
143 
Where – 
 
(a) 
a Reporting Bank has entered into a valid master netting agreement with its 
counterparty and elected to compute the cash outflows from derivative 
contracts with that counterparty on a net basis with cash inflows from 
derivative contracts with the same counterparty in accordance with paragraph 


56 
 
89(a), the Reporting Bank must compute the cash inflows from such derivative 
contracts on a net basis with cash outflows from such derivative contracts; and 
 
(b) 
a Reporting Bank has, for the purposes of its computation of its all currency 
LCR, elected to compute the cash outflows from a foreign exchange derivative 
contract not covered by a master netting agreement, where the foreign 
exchange derivative contract involves a full exchange of principal amounts 
within the same day, on a net basis with cash inflows from the foreign 
exchange derivative contract, in accordance with paragraph 89(b), the 
Reporting Bank must compute the cash inflows from the foreign exchange 
derivative contract on a net basis with cash outflows from the foreign 
exchange derivative contract. 
 
144 
Where derivative contracts are collateralised by HQLA, a Reporting Bank must 
compute the cash inflows from the derivative contracts net of any corresponding cash or 
contractual collateral outflows. 
 
145 
A Reporting Bank must treat options which must be settled by physical delivery as a 
secured lending transaction, and apply the appropriate cash inflow rates in accordance with 
paragraphs 121 to 128. The Reporting Bank may assume cash settlement, if the contractual 
arrangements allow for both physical delivery and cash settlement. Where contractual 
arrangements require physical delivery as the mode of settlement, the Reporting Bank may 
assume that the security of lowest value will be delivered, unless the derivative contract 
provides otherwise. 
 
(II) 
Other contractual cash inflows 
 
146 
A Reporting Bank must apply a cash inflow rate of 0% to all other contractual cash 
inflows within the 30-day LCR horizon, where such cash inflows are not captured in 
paragraphs 121 to 145, or excluded in paragraph 147. The Reporting Bank must, if called upon 
at any time by the Authority, explain to the Authority, what these cash inflows are. 
 
147 
A Reporting Bank must not include the following items as contractual cash inflows: 
 
(a) 
any cash inflow related to non-financial revenues; 
 
(b) 
any forward repurchase agreement, forward reverse repurchase agreement or 
forward collateral swap that starts and matures within the 30-day LCR horizon; 
 
(c) 
any forward repurchase agreement, forward reverse repurchase agreement or 
forward collateral swap that starts prior to and matures after the 30-day LCR 
horizon; 
 


57 
 
(d) 
any forward sale of HQLA. 
 
Scope of Application 
 
148 
Where a Reporting Bank has a branch or subsidiary 65 that is approved, licensed, 
registered or otherwise regulated by a bank regulatory agency in a foreign country or 
jurisdiction to carry on banking business under the laws of the foreign country or jurisdiction 
and the foreign country or jurisdiction does not apply the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision’s global framework for liquidity risk, the Reporting Bank must apply the 
parameters outlined in Part II – LCR for its computation of its LCR for deposits from retail and 
small business customers of that branch or subsidiary. Where a Reporting Bank has a branch 
or subsidiary 66 that is approved, licensed, registered or otherwise regulated by a bank 
regulatory agency in a foreign country or jurisdiction to carry on banking business under the 
laws of the foreign country or jurisdiction and the foreign country or jurisdiction applies the 
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s global framework for liquidity risk, the Reporting 
Bank must interpret paragraphs 44 to 57 and the definition of “small business customers” in 
paragraph 22 (read with paragraph 23) in accordance with the foreign country’s or 
jurisdiction’s equivalent LCR rules for its computation of its LCR for deposits from retail and 
small business customers of that branch or subsidiary. 
 
149 
Where a Reporting Bank has a branch or subsidiary 67 that is approved, licensed, 
registered or otherwise regulated by a bank regulatory agency in a foreign country or 
jurisdiction to carry on banking business under the laws of the foreign country or jurisdiction 
and the foreign country or jurisdiction adopts the Alternative Liquidity Approaches, the 
Reporting Bank may include the HQLA recognised in the foreign country or jurisdiction for its 
computation of its LCR, up to the amount of the Reporting Bank’s total net cash outflows 
stemming from the operations of the Reporting Bank or its branch or subsidiary in the foreign 
country or jurisdiction, and in the domestic currency of the foreign country or jurisdiction. 
 
150 
The Authority may, by notice in writing to a Reporting Bank, impose stricter 
parameters than that set out in Part II – LCR, on the Reporting Bank, under section 38(1) read 
with section 38(2A) of the Act. 
 
Utilisation of HQLA 
 
151 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
give prior written notification to the Authority of its intent to utilise its HQLA

61 
 
Appendix 1 
 
Exclusion as Qualifying Liabilities 
 
1 
Subject to paragraph 2 of this Appendix, a Reporting Bank may exclude a bill of 
exchange as its Qualifying Liabilities if – 
 
(a) 
the bill of exchange is denominated in Singapore dollars. Where the underlying 
transaction referred to the bill of exchange is denominated in a foreign 
currency, the bill must be substituted for the first time into a Singapore dollar 
usance bill; 
 
(b) 
the bill of exchange relates to a trade transaction and reference to such a 
transaction appears on the face of the bill. The trade transaction must be in 
respect of imports into or exports from, Singapore and includes trade 
transactions between foreign exporters and foreign importers arranged by 
companies in Singapore. The Reporting Bank must verify that the first 
discounting bank or first discounting merchant bank in Singapore has 
ascertained that the bill of exchange is in fact related to trade transactions by 
examining the appropriate documents and obtaining written declarations from 
their customers that they have not sought or obtained other means of 
financing; and 
 
(c) 
the outstanding period to maturity of the bill of exchange is 3 months or less. 
 
2 
Despite paragraph 1 of this Appendix, a Reporting Bank must not exclude the following 
bills of exchange from its Qualifying Liabilities: 
 
(a) 
any bill which originates from a “switch transaction” where the transaction is 
solely between a foreign exporter and a foreign importer and the foreign 
currency trade bill is “switched” into a Singapore dollar bill and financed here; 
 
(b) 
any bill which is a bill drawn for a trade transaction in Singapore where all 
parties are in Singapore; 
 
(c) 
any bill which is a bill relating to services; 
 
(d) 
any bill which relates to a trade transaction where the supporting invoice has 
been paid by the customer prior to presentation of the bill to the first 
discounting bank or first discounting merchant bank in Singapore for 
discounting; 
 


62 
 
(e) 
any bill which is overdue or been extended beyond the maturity date and a 
new bill has been drawn to substitute or roll-over the matured bill, regardless 
of whether the original bill had 3 months or less to maturity at the time it was 
discounted by the first discounting bank or first discounting merchant bank in 
Singapore; 
 
(f) 
any bill which is drawn for imports where the importer is also receiving credit 
from the seller for the same period, as the imports would effectively be 
financed by the seller and not from proceeds of the bill. 
 


63 
 
Appendix 2 
 
Bill of Exchange eligible as Liquid Assets 
 
1 
A Reporting Bank that purchases a bill of exchange denominated in Singapore dollars 
from a bank in Singapore or a merchant bank in Singapore may include such a bill as Liquid 
Assets if – 
 
(a) 
the bill has been endorsed by one or more banks in Singapore or merchant 
banks in Singapore; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank has obtained a written confirmation from the first 
discounting bank or first discounting merchant bank in Singapore that – 
 
(i) 
the first discounting bank or first discounting merchant bank in 
Singapore has taken necessary and sufficient steps to ascertain that the 
bills are in fact related to trade transactions as evidenced on the bills; 
 
(ii) 
the bill does not originate from a “switch transaction” where the 
transaction is solely between a foreign exporter and a foreign importer 
and the foreign currency trade bill is “switched” into a Singapore dollar 
bill and financed in Singapore; 
 
(iii) 
the bill is not drawn for a trade transaction in Singapore where all 
parties are in Singapore; 
 
(iv) 
the bill does not relate to services; 
 
(v) 
the bill does not relate to a trade transaction where the supporting 
invoice has been paid by the customer prior to presentation of the bill 
to the first discounting bank or first discounting merchant bank in 
Singapore for discounting; 
 
(vi) 
the bill has not become overdue or been extended beyond the maturity 
date and no new bill has been drawn to substitute or roll-over the 
matured bill, regardless of whether the original bill had 3 months or 
less to maturity at the time it was discounted by the first discounting 
bank or first discounting merchant bank in Singapore; and 
 
(vii) 
the bill is not drawn for imports where the importer is also receiving 
credit from the seller for the same period (as the imports would 
effectively be financed by the seller and not from proceeds of the bills); 
and 


64 
 
 
(c) 
the outstanding period to maturity of the bill is 3 months or less. A bill originally 
drawn for more than 3 months is only eligible as Liquid Asset when there is 3 
months or less to maturity.

are significant currencies on a Group level, country-level group level, entity level or Singapore 
Operations level, as the case may be. The Reporting Bank may, with the Authority’s approval, 
determine an alternate methodology to determine its significant currencies if the default 
methodology, which is based on whether the aggregate liabilities of the Reporting Bank 
denominated in the currency as at the end of the month amounts to 5% or more of the 
Reporting Bank’s total liabilities, does not properly reflect the funding structure of the 
Reporting Bank. The forms to submit are given in the table below. 
 
Country-level compliance 
 
2 
In accordance with paragraph 6 of the Notice, a Reporting Bank on the LCR framework 
may elect to comply with Part II – LCR on a country-level group basis, by consolidating the 
balance sheets of related corporations of the Reporting Bank that are Reporting Banks or 
merchant banks in Singapore. Each Reporting Bank within the country-level group must 
submit the same set of forms as if they were complying with Part II – LCR on an entity level. 
 
3 
Each Reporting Bank within a country-level group must select an entity to perform the 
country-level submission, and this choice has to be made known to the Authority. The 
Reporting Bank must follow the same steps as the entity level submission for the country-
level submission, except that the Reporting Bank must indicate the details of the entities in

Appendix 6 
 
Computation of the cap on Level 2 HQLA with regard to short-term securities financing 
transactions 
 
1 
A Reporting Bank must apply the method described in this Appendix for its 
computation of the cap on Level 2A, Level 2B and Level 2B(II) HQLA with regard to short-term 
securities financing transactions. 
 
2 
As stated in paragraph 35 of the Notice, a Reporting Bank must, in its computation of 
the 40% cap on Level 2 HQLA, take into account the impact on the stock of HQLA of the 
amounts of Level 1 and Level 2 HQLA involved in secured funding, secured lending and 
collateral swap transactions maturing within the 30-day LCR horizon. The Reporting Bank 
must ensure that the maximum amount of adjusted Level 2 HQLA in the stock of HQLA is equal 
to two-thirds of the adjusted amount of Level 1 HQLA after haircuts have been applied. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that its computation of the 40% cap on Level 2 HQLA takes into 
account any reduction in eligible Level 2B HQLA on account of the 15% cap on Level 2B HQLA. 
 
3 
A Reporting Bank must, in its computation of the 15% cap on Level 2B HQLA, take into 
account the impact on the stock of HQLA of the amounts of HQLA involved in secured funding, 
secured lending and collateral swap transactions maturing within the 30-day LCR horizon. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the maximum amount of adjusted Level 2B HQLA in the 
stock of HQLA is equal to 15/85 of the sum of the adjusted amounts of Level 1 and Level 2A 
HQLA, or, in cases where the 40% cap is binding, up to a maximum of 1/4 of the adjusted 
amount of Level 1 HQLA, both after haircuts have been applied. 
 
4 
A Reporting Bank must, in its computation of the 5% cap on Level 2B(II) HQLA, take 
into account the impact on the stock of HQLA of the amounts of HQLA involved in secured 
funding, secured lending and collateral swap transactions maturing within the 30-day LCR 
horizon. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the maximum amount of adjusted Level 2B(II) 
HQLA in the stock of HQLA is equal to 5/95 of the sum of the adjusted amounts of Level 1, 
Level 2A and Level 2B(I) HQLA, or in cases where the 15% cap is binding, up to a maximum of 
5/85 of the adjusted amount of Level 1 and Level 2A HQLA, or in cases where the 40% cap is 
binding, up to a maximum of 5/60 of the adjusted amount of Level 1 and, after haircuts have 
been applied. 
 
5 
The adjusted amount of Level 1, Level 2A, Level 2B(I) and Level 2B(II) HQLA is defined 
as the amount of Level 1, Level 2A, Level 2B(I) and Level 2B(II) HQLA that would result after 
unwinding secured funding, secured lending and collateral swap transactions maturing within 
the 30-day LCR horizon involving the exchange of any HQLA for any Level 1, Level 2A, Level 
2B(I) and Level 2B(II) HQLA (including cash) that meet, or would meet if held unencumbered, 
the operational requirements for HQLA set out in paragraph 31 of the Notice. Relevant 


74 
 
haircuts would be applied prior to the computation of the caps on Level 2 HQLA, Level 2B 
HQLA and Level 2B(II) HQLA set out in paragraphs 2 to 4 of this Appendix respectively. 
 
6 
A reference to “unadjusted” in this Appendix refers to the value of the relevant 
category of HQLA, after accounting for the haircuts as specified in paragraph 33 of the Notice 
and before accounting for the exchange of assets in secured funding, secured lending and 
collateral swap transactions maturing within the 30-day LCR horizon. 
 
7 
A reference to “adjusted” in this Appendix refers to the value of the relevant category 
of HQLA, after accounting for the haircuts as specified in paragraph 33 of the Notice and the 
exchange of assets in secured funding, secured lending and collateral swap transactions 
maturing within the 30-day LCR horizon. 
 
8 
The formula for the computation of HQLA is as follows: 
 
HQLA = Unadjusted Level 1 HQLA + Unadjusted Level 2A HQLA + Unadjusted Level 2B(I) 
HQLA + Unadjusted Level 2B(II) HQLA – Adjustment for 5% Level 2B(II) HQLA cap – 
Adjustment for 15% Level 2B HQLA cap – Adjustment for 40% Level 2 HQLA cap, 
 
where – 
 
(a) 
Adjustment for 5% Level 2B(II) HQLA cap = MAX (Adjusted Level 2B(II) HQLA – 
(5/95)*(Adjusted Level 1 HQLA + Adjusted Level 2A HQLA + Adjusted Level 2B(I) 
HQLA), Adjusted Level 2B(II) HQLA – (5/85)*(Adjusted Level 1 HQLA + Adjusted 
Level 2A HQLA), Adjusted Level 2B(II) HQLA – (5/60)*Adjusted Level 1 HQLA,0); 
 
(b)

Appendix 8 
 
Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management 
 
1 
The guidelines referred to in footnotes 12 and 19 of the Notice are as follows: 
 
(a) 
a Reporting Bank should actively monitor and control liquidity risk exposures 
and funding needs at the level of individual legal entities, foreign branches and 
subsidiaries, and the banking group as a whole, taking into account legal, 
regulatory and operational limitations to the transferability of liquidity; 
 
(b) 
where a Reporting Bank has a branch or subsidiary68 in a foreign country or 
jurisdiction, the Reporting Bank should have processes in place to capture all 
existing liquidity transfer restrictions to the extent practicable, and to monitor 
the rules and regulations in the foreign countries or jurisdictions and assess 
their liquidity implications for the banking group as a whole; 
 
(c) 
a Reporting Bank should conduct their own stress tests to assess the level of 
liquidity they should hold, and construct their own scenarios that could cause 
difficulties for their specific business activities. Such internal stress tests should 
incorporate time horizons longer than 30 days. A Reporting Bank that is an 
internationally active bank or that has been notified by the Authority that it is 
a D-SIB should share the results of these additional stress tests with the 
Authority; 
 
(d) 
a Reporting Bank should monitor the legal entity and physical location where 
collateral is held and how it may be mobilised in a timely manner. Specifically, 
it should have a policy in place that identifies legal entities, geographical 
locations, currencies and specific custodial or bank accounts where liquid 
assets are held; 
 
(e) 
a Reporting Bank should actively manage its intraday liquidity positions and 
risks to meet payment and settlement obligations on a timely basis under both 
normal and stressed conditions and thus contribute to the smooth functioning 
of payment and settlement systems; 
 
(f) 
a Reporting Bank should meet their liquidity needs in each currency and 
maintain liquid assets consistent with the distribution of their liquidity needs 
by currency. The Reporting Bank should be able to use the liquid assets to 
generate liquidity in the currency and in the country or jurisdiction in which 
the net cash outflows arise. In managing foreign exchange liquidity risk, the 
 
68

Reporting Bank should take into account the risk that its ability to swap 
currencies and access the relevant foreign exchange markets may erode 
rapidly under stressed conditions. The Reporting Bank should be aware that 
sudden, adverse exchange rate movements could sharply widen existing 
mismatched positions and alter the effectiveness of any foreign exchange 
hedges in place; 
 
(g) 
a Reporting Bank should ensure that liquid assets held are well diversified 
within the asset classes themselves (except for sovereign debt from Singapore 
or from a foreign country or jurisdiction where the Reporting Bank has a 
branch or subsidiary 69 that is approved, licensed, registered or otherwise 
regulated by a bank regulatory agency in the foreign country or jurisdiction to 
carry on banking business under the laws of the foreign country or jurisdiction, 
central bank reserves, central bank debt securities, and cash). The Reporting 
Bank should have policies and limits in place in order to avoid concentration 
with respect to asset types, issue and issuer types, and currency (consistent 
with the distribution of net cash outflows by currency) within asset classes; 
 
(h) 
a Reporting Bank should monitor the concentration of cash inflows across 
wholesale customers in the context of the Reporting Bank’s liquidity 
management in order to limit overreliance on the arrival of cash inflows from 
one or a limited number of wholesale customers.

In this Appendix, “liquid assets” means – 
 
(a) 
in relation to a Reporting Bank that has chosen to comply with Part I – MLA of 
the Notice, any Liquid Asset as defined in paragraph 7 of the Notice; and 
 
(b) 
in relation to a Reporting Bank that must comply with or has chosen to comply 
with Part II – LCR of the Notice, any high quality liquid asset or HQLA as defined 
in paragraph 22 of the Notice.
