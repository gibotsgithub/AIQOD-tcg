A Reporting Bank must –  
  
(a)  not consolidate the assets and liabilities of an insurance subsidiary; and 
  
(b)  account for the investment in such a subsidiary at cost,  
 
when preparing the consolidated financial statements of the banking group for the 
purposes of calculating its capital adequacy ratio requirements at the Group level.  
 
3.1.3 
Subject to paragraph 3.1.2 and Part VI, a Reporting Bank may exclude from 
consolidation the assets and liabilities of any other subsidiary when preparing the 
consolidated financial statements of the banking group for the purposes of calculating its 
capital adequacy ratio requirements at the Group level only where such non-consolidation 
is expressly permitted under the Accounting Standards. Despite the provisions set out in 
this paragraph, the exemption for an entity that is a parent from presenting consolidated 
financial statements in paragraph 4(a) of FRS 110 does not apply to the Reporting Bank 
for the purposes of complying with paragraph 3.1.1(b).  
 
3.1.4  
Pursuant to paragraphs 3.1.1(b), 3.1.2 and 3.1.3, and for the purposes of the 
capital adequacy ratio requirements at the Group level in this Notice (other than 
paragraphs 3.1.1(b), 3.1.2 and 3.1.3), a Reporting Bank must deem –  
 
(a) 
all assets, liabilities, equity, transactions, exposures and operations of a 
banking group entity of a Reporting Bank to be that of the Reporting Bank 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

(per the scope of consolidation in paragraphs 3.1.1(b), 3.1.2 and 3.1.3); 
and  
 
(b) 
all collateral held by a banking group entity of a Reporting Bank to be 
collateral held by the Reporting Bank (per the scope of consolidation in 
paragraphs 3.1.1(b), 3.1.2 and 3.1.3). 
 
 
Issuers of covered bonds 
 
3.1.5 
Where the Reporting Bank issues covered bonds, the Reporting Bank must 
continue to hold capital against its exposures in respect of the assets included in a cover 
pool in accordance with this Notice.  Where the Reporting Bank uses an SPV to issue 
covered bonds or to hold the cover pool, the Reporting Bank must apply a “look through” 
approach for the purposes of computing capital requirements under this Notice. Under the 
“look through” approach, the Reporting Bank must treat the Reporting Bank and the SPV 
as a single entity for the purposes of this Notice by –  
 
(a)  deeming the assets of the cover pool held in the SPV (if any) as assets of 
the Reporting Bank, at both the Solo and Group levels; and  
 
(b)  eliminating transactions between the Reporting Bank and the SPV. 
 
  
 
Division 2:  Leverage Ratio Requirements 
 
 
Requirements to Apply at both the Solo and Group Levels 
 
3.2.1 
A Reporting Bank must comply with the leverage ratio requirements in this 
Notice at 2 levels: 
 
(a) 
the bank standalone (“Solo”) level, which measures the leverage ratio of 
a Reporting Bank based on its standalone capital strength;  
 
(b) 
the consolidated (“Group”) level, which measures the leverage ratio of a 
Reporting Bank based on its capital strength after consolidating the assets 
and liabilities of its banking group entities, taking into account –  
 
(i) 
any exclusions of certain banking group entities provided for under 
paragraphs 3.2.2 and 3.2.3; and 
 
(ii) 
any adjustments pursuant to Division 6 of Part VII. 
 
 
 
Non-consolidation of Certain Subsidiaries at the Group Level 
 
3.2.2 
A Reporting Bank must –  
  
(a)  not consolidate the assets and liabilities of an insurance subsidiary; and 
  
(b)  account for the investment in such a subsidiary at cost,

when preparing the consolidated financial statements of the banking group for the 
purposes of calculating its leverage ratio at the Group level.  
 
3.2.3 
Subject to paragraph 3.2.2 and Part VI, a Reporting Bank may exclude from 
consolidation the assets and liabilities of any other subsidiary when preparing the 
consolidated financial statements of the banking group for the purposes of calculating its 
leverage ratio at the Group level only where such non-consolidation is expressly permitted 
under the Accounting Standards. Notwithstanding the provisions set out in this paragraph, 
the exemption for an entity that is a parent from presenting consolidated financial 
statements in paragraph 4(a) of FRS 110 does not apply to the Reporting Bank for the 
purposes of complying with paragraph 3.2.1(b). 
 
3.2.4 
Pursuant to paragraphs 3.2.1(b), 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, and for the purposes of the 
leverage ratio requirements at the Group level in this Notice (other than paragraphs 
3.2.1(b), 3.2.2 and 3.2.3), a Reporting Bank must deem – 
 
(a) 
all assets, liabilities, equity, transactions, exposures and operations of a 
banking group entity of a Reporting Bank to be that of the Reporting Bank 
(per the scope of consolidation in paragraphs 3.2.1(b), 3.2.2 and 3.2.3); 
and  
 
(b) 
all collateral held by a banking group entity of a Reporting Bank to be 
collateral held by the Reporting Bank (per the scope of consolidation in 
paragraphs 3.2.1(b), 3.2.2 and 3.2.3).

Credit RWA + Market RWA + Operational RWA 
4.1.4 
A Reporting Bank must determine37 the denominators for CET1 CAR, Tier 1 CAR 
and Total CAR by taking the higher of – 
(a)
the sum of credit RWA, market RWA, and operational RWA, calculated
using the Reporting Bank’s nominated approaches; and
(b)
its output floor calculated in accordance with Part V.
Minimum ratios

4.1.7  
In addition to complying with the applicable minimum ratios in paragraph 4.1.5 
or 4.1.6, as the case may be, a Reporting Bank must, at all times, maintain at both the 
Solo and Group levels, a capital conservation buffer comprising CET1 Capital of 2.5% of 
total RWA (sum of Credit RWA, Market RWA and Operational RWA). 
 
4.1.8  
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its CET1 Capital is first used to meet the 
applicable minimum ratios in paragraph 4.1.5 or 4.1.6, as the case may be, before the 
remainder can count towards its capital conservation buffer.  
 
4.1.9 
For the purposes of paragraphs 4.1.10, 4.1.11, 4.1.12, 4.1.13, 4.1.14 and 
4.1.25 – 
 
(a) 
“CET1 CAR” in Tables 4-3 and 4-4, calculated as at the date of each 
distribution of an item subject to the restriction on distributions 
(“calculation date”), includes CET1 Capital used to meet the applicable 
minimum CET1 CAR in paragraph 4.1.5 or 4.1.6, as the case may be, but 
excludes any additional CET1 Capital needed to meet the applicable 
minimum Tier 1 CAR and applicable minimum Total CAR in paragraph 
4.1.5 or 4.1.6, as the case may be;  
 
 
(b) 
“buffer” refers to the capital conservation buffer set out in paragraph 
4.1.7; 
 
(c) 
“distribution payment period” refers to the 12 months starting from the 
calculation date referred to in sub-paragraph (a); 
 
(d) 
“minimum capital conservation ratios” refer to the percentage of a 
Reporting Bank’s earnings, as defined in sub-paragraph (f), that a 
Reporting Bank is required to conserve in the distribution payment period;  
  
(e) 
“item subject to the restriction on distributions” refers to any distribution 
in the form of dividends, share buybacks, discretionary payments on AT1 
capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments to staff, but 
excludes the following: 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 
4-3 
(i) 
a payment that does not result in a depletion of CET1 Capital by the 
Reporting Bank39;  
 
(ii) 
a dividend which satisfies all of the following conditions:  
 
(A) 
the dividend cannot legally be cancelled by the Reporting Bank; 
 
(B) the dividend has already been removed from CET1 Capital prior 
to the distribution of the dividend;  
 
(C) the dividend was declared in line with the applicable capital 
conservation ratios set out in paragraph 4.1.11 at the date of 
declaration; and 
 
(f) 
“earnings” refers to the Reporting Bank’s distributable profits in the 4 
quarters preceding the calculation date, calculated gross of the deduction 
of items subject to the restriction on distributions and less the tax which 
would have been payable had none of the items subject to the restriction 
on distributions been paid40.  
 
4.1.10 
For the purposes of this Part, the capital conservation buffer range refers to –  
 
(a) 
for a Reporting Bank that is designated by the Authority as a D-SIB, a 
CET1 CAR as defined in paragraph 4.1.9(a) of between 6.5% and the sum 
of 6.5% and the capital conservation buffer as defined in paragraph 4.1.7; 
and 
 
(b) 
for a Reporting Bank that is not designated by the Authority as a D-SIB, 
a CET1 CAR as defined in paragraph 4.1.9(a) of between 4.5% and the 
sum of 4.5% and the capital conservation buffer as defined in paragraph 
4.1.7.  
 
4.1.11 
Despite paragraph 4.1.7, where the CET1 CAR as defined in paragraph 4.1.9(a) 
of a Reporting Bank is within the capital conservation buffer range41 as at the date of each 
distribution of an item subject to the restriction on distributions – 
 
(a) 
a Reporting Bank that is designated by the Authority as a D-SIB must 
meet the minimum capital conservation ratios corresponding to the ranges 
of CET1 CAR, as defined in paragraph 4.1.9(a), set out in Table 4-3 in 
accordance with paragraphs 4.1.9 and 4.1.12; and 
 
(b) 
a Reporting Bank that is not designated by the Authority as a D-SIB must 
meet the minimum capital conservation ratios corresponding to the ranges 
of CET1 CAR, as defined in paragraph 4.1.9(a), set out in Table 4-4 in 
accordance with paragraphs 4.1.9 and 4.1.12. 
 
 
 
39  
For example, scrip dividends.  
40   This is to reverse any tax impact of making such distributions.  
41  
For example, in periods of stress. A Reporting Bank should not choose in normal times, outside periods of 
stress, to operate within the capital conservation buffer range.

4.1.12 
In respect of items subject to the restriction on distributions42, the Reporting 
Bank must, in any distribution payment period, distribute no more than the percentage of 
(100% less the minimum capital conservation ratio) of its earnings. 
 
4.1.13 
To avoid doubt, for the purposes of paragraph 4.1.12 –  
 
(a)  where a Reporting Bank’s CET1 CAR, as defined in paragraph 4.1.9(a), 
falls into a lower quartile of buffer as at the next calculation date for the 
next 
distribution 
payment 
period, 
the 
higher 
minimum 
capital 
conservation ratio applicable to the lower quartile of buffer would apply 
for the next distribution payment period; and 
 
(b)  where a Reporting Bank’s CET1 CAR, as defined in paragraph 4.1.9(a), 
falls into an upper quartile of buffer as at the next calculation date for the 
next 
distribution 
payment 
period, 
the 
higher 
minimum 
capital 
conservation ratio applicable to the current distribution payment period 
 
42  
For example, a Reporting Bank that is designated by the Authority as a D-SIB with a CET1 CAR in the range 
of greater than 7.125% to 7.75% is required to conserve 80% of its earnings in the distribution payment 
period (i.e. distribute no more than 20% of earnings in terms of items subject to the restriction on 
distributions). To avoid doubt, the capital conservation requirement applies to items subject to the 
restriction on distributions only, not the operation of the Reporting Bank. A Reporting Bank should be able 
to conduct business as normal when its capital adequacy ratios fall within the capital conservation buffer 
range as it experiences losses. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 
4-5 
would continue to apply until the end of the current distribution payment 
period.    
 
4.1.14 
Despite paragraph 4.1.11, where a Reporting Bank –  
 
(a) 
does not have positive earnings; and 
 
(b) 
has a CET1 CAR as defined in paragraph 4.1.9(a) of less than the sum  
of –  
 
(i) 
the applicable minimum CET1 CAR in paragraph 4.1.5 or 4.1.6, as 
the case may be; and  
 
(ii) 
the capital conservation buffer in accordance with paragraph 4.1.7, 
 
the Reporting Bank must not make distributions of any item subject to the restriction on 
distributions in the distribution payment period.  
 
4.1.15 
Despite paragraphs 4.1.11, 4.1.12 and 4.1.14 which impose constraints on 
distributions, a Reporting Bank may, with the Authority’s prior written approval, make any 
distributions in excess of the constraints imposed by those paragraphs, provided that the 
Reporting Bank raises capital in the private sector equal to the amount above the 
constraint that it wishes to distribute and subject to any further conditions and restrictions 
that the Authority may specify in its approval. 
 
4.1.16 
A Reporting Bank intending to draw on its capital conservation buffer must 
consult the Authority in advance and must present a capital plan on the rebuilding of the 
capital conservation buffer. The Reporting Bank must demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Authority that its capital plan will rebuild the capital conservation buffer within an 
appropriate timeframe.43 The Authority may impose a time limit on a Reporting Bank 
operating within the capital conservation buffer range for, or other conditions related to, 
the rebuilding of the capital conservation buffer.  
 
 
Countercyclical buffer 
 
4.1.17 
In addition to complying with the applicable minimum ratios in paragraph 4.1.5 
or 4.1.6, as the case may be, and the capital conservation buffer in paragraph 4.1.7, a 
Reporting Bank must, at all times, maintain at both the Solo and Group levels, a 
countercyclical buffer comprising CET1 Capital ranging from zero up to 2.5% of total RWA 
(sum of Credit RWA, Market RWA and Operational RWA). To avoid doubt, the 
countercyclical buffer applicable to a Reporting Bank can be 0% at a particular point in 
time.  
 
 
 
43  
A Reporting Bank operating within the capital conservation buffer range may look to rebuild its capital 
buffers through reducing discretionary distribution of earnings including reducing discretionary dividend 
payments, share-buybacks and staff bonus payments. The Reporting Bank may also choose to raise new 
capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. The Reporting 
Bank should not use future predictions of recovery as justification for maintaining distributions to 
shareholders, other capital providers and staff. The Reporting Bank should not signal their financial strength 
through the distribution of capital. The Reporting Bank should also make greater efforts to rebuild its capital 
buffers the more they are depleted.

4.1.18  
For the purposes of paragraphs 4.1.19, 4.1.22, 4.1.23 and 4.1.28 to 4.1.31 – 
 
(a) 
“country-specific 
countercyclical 
buffer 
requirement” 
means 
the 
countercyclical buffer requirement in respect of a particular country or 
jurisdiction (expressed as a percentage of RWA), which –  
 
(i) 
in the case of Singapore, the Authority has applied; and 
 
(ii) 
in the case of a country or jurisdiction other than Singapore, the 
national authority has applied44,45, subject to a cap of 2.5% unless 
the Authority specifies that the cap does not apply or that a higher 
country-specific countercyclical buffer requirement applies, and 
subject to paragraph 4.1.21; and 
  
(b) 
“RWA for private sector credit exposures” means, in relation to a Reporting 
Bank, the aggregate of –   
 
(i) 
the credit RWA in respect of all the exposures in its banking book, 
other than – 
 
(A) SA(CR) exposures referred to in paragraph 7.3.1(a), (b), (c), 
(d), (e)(i), (e)(ii), (e)(iii) and (e)(iv); and 
 
(B) IRBA exposures referred to in paragraph 7.4.42(c) and (d), 
except for IRBA exposures to counterparties referred to in 
paragraphs 7.3.1(e)(v) and 7.4.42(d)(iv); and 
 
 (ii)  12.5 times of – 
 
(A) for the period from 1 July 2024 to 31 December 2024 (both 
dates inclusive), the market risk capital requirements for 
specific 
risk, 
IRC 
and 
securitisation 
exposures, 
where 
applicable, calculated in accordance with Part VIII of MAS 
Notice 637, in force immediately before 1 July 2024, in respect 
of all the exposures in the trading book, other than exposures 
to other banks, sovereigns, MDBs and PSEs46; and 
 
44  
A Reporting Bank may refer to the document, “Guidance for national authorities operating the 
countercyclical capital buffer” issued by the BCBS in December 2010, to understand the factors that could 
be considered by national authorities in applying the countercyclical buffer requirement.  
45 
A country or jurisdiction is expected to announce, and promptly notify the Bank for International 
Settlements of –  
(a) any decision to raise the level of the countercyclical buffer requirement for its country or jurisdiction 
up to 12 months prior to the requirement taking effect; and  
(b) any decision to lower the level of the countercyclical buffer requirement for its country or jurisdiction. 
The country or jurisdiction is also expected to communicate its buffer decisions to the Bank for 
International Settlements at least annually, including where there is no change in the prevailing 
countercyclical buffer requirements. The pre-announced buffer decisions and the actual buffers in place 
for BCBS member countries or jurisdictions will be published on the website of the Bank for 
International Settlements (https://www.bis.org/ccyb/index.htm). 
46  
In the case of a Reporting Bank using the IMA under Part VIII of MAS Notice 637, in force immediately 
before 1 July 2024, for calculating its market risk capital requirement for the period from 1 July 2024 to 31 
December 2024 (both dates inclusive), the Reporting Bank should develop an approach that would translate 
the VaR for specific risk, the IRC and the comprehensive risk measurement charge into individual

(B) in all other cases:  
 
(I) 
where the Reporting Bank uses the SA(MR), the DRC 
requirement, calculated in accordance with Division 2 of 
Part VIII in respect of securitisation (CTP), securitisation 
(non-CTP) and non-securitisation exposures in the trading 
book47;  
(II) where the Reporting Bank uses the IMA, the DRC 
requirement calculated in accordance with paragraphs 
8.3.213 to 8.3.240 in respect of both securitisation and 
non-securitisation exposures in the trading book48; 
(III)  where the Reporting Bank only uses the SSA(MR), its 
market risk capital requirements for specific risk in respect 
of both securitisation and non-securitisation exposures in 
the trading book,  
where the scope of the exposures excludes exposures to other 
banks, sovereigns, MDBs and PSEs.  
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must include exposures to non-bank 
financial institutions within the scope of private sector credit exposures for 
the purposes of sub-paragraph (b).

instrument risk weights that would then be allocated to the geographic location of the specific 
counterparties that make up the charge based on where the ultimate risk of the exposures reside. The 
manner in which the translation is done should be subject to the agreement of the Authority. In cases 
where it is not possible to break down the charges in such a manner due to the risk charges being calculated 
on a portfolio by portfolio basis, the risk charge for a particular portfolio should be allocated to the 
geographic regions of the constituents of the portfolio by calculating the proportion of the portfolio’s total 
EAD that is due to the EAD resulting from counterparties in each geographic region based on where the 
ultimate risk of the exposures reside.

The Reporting Bank should develop an approach that would translate the DRC requirement into individual 
instrument risk weights that would then be allocated to the geographical location of the specific 
counterparties of the exposures that make up the DRC requirement, based on where the ultimate risk of 
the exposures reside. The manner in which the translation is done should be subject to the agreement of

4.1.19 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the actual magnitude of the countercyclical 
buffer to be applied under paragraph 4.1.17 as the weighted average of the country-
specific countercyclical buffer requirements that are being applied in countries or 
jurisdictions by national authorities to which the Reporting Bank has private sector credit 
exposures. The Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a)  calculate each weighting by dividing the Reporting Bank’s RWA for all its 
private sector credit exposures in each country or jurisdiction by the 
Reporting Bank’s RWA for all its private sector credit exposures across all 
countries or jurisdictions; and  
 
(b)  apply the weighting calculated in sub-paragraph (a) for each country or 
jurisdiction to the country-specific countercyclical buffer requirement of 
that country or jurisdiction.  
 
4.1.20 
A country or jurisdiction whose national authority is a member of the BCBS or 
that is specified by the Authority, is referred to in paragraph 4.1.21 as a relevant country 
or jurisdiction.  
 
4.1.21 
For the purposes of paragraph 4.1.19, a Reporting Bank must apply a weight 
of zero to –  
 
(a) 
a relevant country or jurisdiction where its private sector credit exposures 
to that relevant country or jurisdiction is zero; or 
 
(b) 
a country or jurisdiction that is not a relevant country or jurisdiction.  
 
4.1.22 
For the purposes of paragraph 4.1.19, a Reporting Bank must determine the 
country or jurisdiction for each private sector exposure in accordance with Annex 4B. 
 
4.1.23 
Subject to paragraph 4.1.21, for the purposes of paragraph 4.1.19, a Reporting 
Bank must apply each country-specific countercyclical buffer requirement in calculating its 
countercyclical buffer from the effective date specified by the relevant national authority 
except in the following cases where the Reporting Bank must apply each country-specific 
countercyclical buffer requirement in calculating its countercyclical buffer from the 
effective date specified by the Authority – 
 
(a) 
for an increase in a countercyclical buffer requirement in respect of a 
country or jurisdiction other than Singapore, where the period between 
the date of announcement and the effective date of the countercyclical 
capital buffer requirement is less than 12 months, and the Authority 
specifies a different effective date, no more than 12 months from the date 
of announcement by that country or jurisdiction; and 
 
(b) 
for a decrease in a countercyclical buffer requirement in respect of a 
country or jurisdiction other than Singapore, where the Authority specifies 
a later effective date.   
 
4.1.24  
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the size of the capital conservation buffer 
applicable to a Reporting Bank under paragraph 4.1.7 is extended by the countercyclical 
buffer.

Despite paragraphs 4.1.7 and 4.1.17, where the CET1 CAR as defined in 
paragraph 4.1.9(a) is within the capital conservation buffer range referred to in paragraph

4.1.27 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its countercyclical buffer is calculated with 
at least the same frequency as its capital adequacy ratios. The Reporting Bank must 
calculate its countercyclical buffer based on the latest relevant country-specific 
countercyclical buffer requirements that are applicable at the date which the Reporting 
Bank calculates its capital adequacy ratios. 
 
 
National countercyclical buffer requirements 
 
4.1.28 
Where the Authority has assessed a period of excess credit growth to be leading 
to a build up of system-wide risk, the Authority will consider setting a countercyclical buffer 
requirement in respect of Singapore (“Singapore-specific countercyclical buffer 
requirement”). The Authority will determine the size of the Singapore-specific 
countercyclical buffer requirement.   
 
4.1.29 
For the purposes of paragraph 4.1.28, the Singapore-specific countercyclical 
buffer requirement will range from zero to 2.5% of total RWA (sum of Credit RWA, Market 
RWA and Operational RWA), based on the Authority’s assessment of the extent of the 
build-up of system-wide risk. The Authority will apply the principles in the document, 
“Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical buffer” issued by the BCBS 
in December 2010, in making its decisions on the level of the Singapore-specific 
countercyclical buffer requirement. 
 
4.1.30 
The Authority may implement a range of additional macroprudential tools 
including setting a Singapore-specific countercyclical buffer requirement that is higher 
than 2.5% of total RWA (sum of Credit RWA, Market RWA and Operational RWA) despite 
paragraph 4.1.29, if the Authority deems it necessary to do so, based on the Authority’s 
assessment of the extent of excess credit growth and build-up of system-wide risk in 
Singapore.  
 
4.1.31 
The Authority will announce any decision by the Authority to set or to increase 
the Singapore-specific countercyclical buffer requirement, prior to but no longer than 12 
months before Singapore-specific countercyclical buffer requirement is to take effect.  
 
4.1.32  
The Authority will announce any decision by the Authority to decrease the 
Singapore-specific countercyclical buffer requirement, and any such decision will take 
effect from the date of the announcement, unless otherwise specified by the Authority.50 
 
 
Overall capital adequacy 
 
4.1.33 
Despite that a Reporting Bank has complied with the requirements set out in 
paragraphs 4.1.5, 4.1.6, 4.1.7 and 4.1.17, the Reporting Bank must consider as part of 
its ICAAP whether it has adequate capital at both the Solo and Group levels, to cover its 
exposure to all risks.  
 
 
50  
The Authority will communicate any of its announcements to set, increase, or decrease the Singapore-
specific countercyclical buffer requirement promptly to the Bank for International Settlements. The 
Authority will also communicate its buffer decisions to the Bank for International Settlements at least 
annually, including where there is no change to the prevailing Singapore-specific countercyclical buffer 
requirement.

4.1.34 
The Authority may, pursuant to section 10(3) of the Banking Act, vary the 
minimum CET1 CAR, minimum Tier 1 CAR, minimum Total CAR, capital conservation buffer 
or countercyclical buffer applicable to a Reporting Bank. In exercising this discretion, the 
Authority may take into account, inter alia, any relevant risk factor, the ICAAP of a 
Reporting Bank and whether the CET1 CAR, Tier 1 CAR or Total CAR is commensurate with 
the overall risk profile of the Reporting Bank.

Division 2:  Leverage Ratio51 
 
4.2.1 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its leverage ratio as set out in Annex 4C.  
 
4.2.2 
A Reporting Bank must, at all times, maintain at both the Solo and Group levels, 
a minimum leverage ratio of 3%. 
 
 
 
 
51  
The leverage ratio is intended to – 
(a)  restrict the build-up of leverage in the banking sector to avoid destabilising deleveraging processes 
that damage the broader financial system and the economy; and 
(b)  reinforce the risk-based capital requirements with a simple, non-risk-based “backstop” measure.

Annex 4B 
 
DETERMINATION OF COUNTRY OR JURISDICTION FOR A PRIVATE SECTOR 
CREDIT EXPOSURE 
 
1.1 
Subject to paragraph 1.5 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must determine the 
country or jurisdiction for a private sector credit exposure based on the country or 
jurisdiction where the ultimate risk of the exposure resides, in accordance with the 
principles 
to 
identify 
the 
country 
or 
jurisdiction 
of 
ultimate 
risk 
in  
Table 4B-1, and paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4 of this Annex.  
 
1.2 
For the purposes of Table 4B-1, a Reporting Bank must apply the principles 
described under “(I) Basic scenario” to identify the country or jurisdiction of ultimate risk 
for a private sector credit exposure, unless the principles described under “(II) Specific 
scenarios for other exposures” in the subsequent rows are applicable.  
 
1.3 
For a private sector credit exposure with credit protection, the country or 
jurisdiction where the ultimate risk of the exposure resides refers to the country or 
jurisdiction where the counterparty providing the credit protection resides. 
 
1.4 
For the purposes of paragraph 1.3 of this Annex, where a private sector credit 
exposure has more than one counterparty providing the credit protection, a Reporting 
Bank must sub-divide the exposure into portions covered by the credit protection provided 
by each counterparty. For each sub-divided portion of the exposure, the country or 
jurisdiction where the ultimate risk of the exposure resides, refers to the country or 
jurisdiction where the counterparty providing the credit protection resides. 
 
1.5 
In the case of securitisation exposures, where a Reporting Bank is unable to 
look through to the underlying exposures, the Reporting Bank must use the country or 
jurisdiction where the immediate counterparty resides.    
 
1.6 
Where a Reporting Bank is unable to identify the country or jurisdiction of 
ultimate risk for a private sector credit exposure in accordance with paragraph 1.1 of this 
Annex, the Reporting Bank may determine the country or jurisdiction of the private sector 
credit exposure based on the country or jurisdiction where the private sector credit 
exposure is booked. The Reporting Bank must demonstrate to the Authority why it is 
unable to do so if requested by the Authority.

Annex 4C 
 
CALCULATION OF THE LEVERAGE RATIO 
 
 
Section 1: Overview 
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its leverage ratio as follows:  
 
Capital measure (CM) 
 Leverage ratio 
(LR) 
    =   
------------------------------------------------ 
Total exposure measure (TEM) 
 
 
Scope of application 
 
1.2 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its leverage ratio at both the Solo and Group 
levels as set out in Division 2 of Part III as at the end of each quarter. Where a Reporting 
Bank does not consolidate its investment in an entity in accordance with Division 2 of Part 
III, the Reporting Bank must only include the investment in the capital of such entity (i.e. 
only the carrying amount of the investment, and not the underlying assets and other 
exposures of the entity), in the calculation of its TEM.  
 
1.3 
A Reporting Bank may deduct in the calculation of its TEM any item which is 
deducted in the calculation of CET1 Capital or AT1 Capital in accordance with paragraphs 
6.1.5 and 6.2.6 respectively, including:  
 
(a) 
the amount of any investment in the capital of an entity that is totally or 
partially deducted in the calculation of CET1 Capital or AT1 Capital in 
accordance with paragraphs 6.1.5(p) and 6.2.6(d) respectively, where the 
entity is not consolidated in accordance with Division 2 of Part III;  
 
(b) 
any shortfall of the TEP relative to the EL amount deducted in the 
calculation of CET1 Capital in accordance with paragraph 6.1.5(e), where 
the Reporting Bank has adopted the IRBA; 
 
(c) 
any valuation adjustments made in accordance with Annex 6C that exceed 
the valuation adjustments made under financial reporting standards, 
deducted in the calculation of CET1 Capital in accordance with paragraph 
6.1.5(n),  
 
but a Reporting Bank must not deduct in the calculation of its TEM any item related to 
liabilities. 
 
1.4 
Where a Reporting Bank issues covered bonds, the Reporting Bank must 
calculate its leverage ratio by including the EM in respect of assets included in a cover pool 
in the calculation of its TEM in accordance with this Annex. Where the Reporting Bank uses 
an SPV to issue covered bonds or to hold the cover pool, the Reporting Bank must apply 
a “look through” approach in calculating its leverage ratio under this Annex. Under the 
“look through” approach, the Reporting Bank must treat the Reporting Bank and the SPV 
as a single entity for the purposes of this Annex by – 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-18 
 
(a)  deeming the assets of the cover pool held in the SPV (if any) as assets of 
the Reporting Bank, at both the Solo and Group levels; and  
 
(b)  eliminating transactions between the Reporting Bank and the SPV. 
 
 
Section 2: EM  
 
2.1 
Subject to paragraphs 2.2 to 2.53 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
calculate its TEM in accordance with the Accounting Standards. 
 
2.2 
Unless otherwise specified in this Annex, a Reporting Bank must not net assets 
against liabilities when calculating its TEM, and must not take into account physical or 
financial collateral, guarantees or other CRM to reduce its TEM. 
 
2.3 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its TEM by aggregating the sum of exposure 
measures in respect of all the Reporting Bank’s – 
 
(a) 
on-balance sheet items calculated in accordance with paragraphs 2.8 to 
2.12 of this Annex (other than items specified in sub-paragraphs (b) and 
(c)) (“exposure measures in respect of on-balance sheet items”); 
 
(b) 
derivative transactions calculated in accordance with paragraphs 2.13 to 
2.39 of this Annex (“exposure measures in respect of derivative 
transactions”); 
 
(c) 
SFTs (including SFTs that have failed to settle) calculated in accordance 
with paragraphs 2.40 to 2.50 of this Annex (“exposure measures in 
respect of SFTs”); and 
 
(d) 
off-balance sheet items calculated in accordance with paragraphs 2.51 to 
2.53 of this Annex (other than items specified in sub-paragraphs (b) and 
(c)) (“exposure measures in respect of off-balance sheet items”), 
 
and then applying deductions in accordance with paragraphs 1.3, 2.6, 2.8 and 2.21(b) of 
this Annex. Where an off-balance sheet item is treated as a derivative transaction under 
the Accounting Standards, the Reporting Bank must calculate the EM in respect of the item 
as a derivative transaction in accordance with sub-paragraph (b). 
 
2.4 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.3 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
calculate the exposure measures in respect of – 
 
(a) 
long settlement transactions; and  
 
 (b) unsettled transactions other than SFTs,  
 
in accordance with their classification under the Accounting Standards, as follows: 
 
(i) 
the EM in respect of a long settlement transaction classified as a derivative 
under the Accounting Standards must be calculated as the EM in respect 
of a derivative transaction under paragraph 2.3(b) of this Annex;  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-19 
 
(ii)  the EM in respect of an unsettled transaction classified as a receivable 
under the Accounting Standards must be calculated as the EM in respect 
of an on-balance sheet item under paragraph 2.3(a) of this Annex. 
 
2.5 
A Reporting Bank must not deduct any liability item including any – 
 
 (a) 
gains or losses on fair valued liabilities; or  
 
 (b) accounting valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities due to changes 
in the Reporting Bank’s own credit risk,  
 
as described in paragraph 6.1.5(h), in the calculation of its TEM.  
 
2.6 
A Reporting Bank which is an originator in a traditional securitisation may 
deduct securitised exposures that are included in its on-balance sheet items, in the 
calculation of its TEM only if all of the requirements in Section 1 of Annex 7AC have been 
complied with. A Reporting Bank that deducts such securitised exposures in the calculation 
of its TEM must include the exposure measures in respect of any securitisation exposures 
it retains in the calculation of its TEM. To avoid doubt, in cases where – 
 
(a) 
a Reporting Bank is an originator in a traditional securitisation but not all 
the requirements in Section 1 of Annex 7AC have been complied with; or 
 
(b) 
a Reporting Bank is an originator in a synthetic securitisation, 
 
the Reporting Bank must not deduct its securitised exposures in the calculation of its TEM.  
 
2.7 
Where the Authority is concerned that the leverage of certain transactions or 
structures undertaken by a Reporting Bank is not adequately captured in the calculation 
of its TEM, the Authority may impose additional bank-specific capital requirements or take 
any other supervisory action, such as requiring enhancements to a Reporting Bank’s 
management of leverage or imposing additional reporting to the Authority, to address the 
risks arising from such transactions.52  
 
 
 
 
 
 
52  
A Reporting Bank should be vigilant to transactions and structures, for which the leverage undertaken by 
the Reporting Bank is inadequately captured in the TEM. A Reporting Bank should consult the Authority on 
the appropriate treatment of any such transactions or structures, where such transactions or structures are 
identified or where the Reporting Bank is in doubt. Examples of transactions where such concerns may 
arise include – 
(a)  an SFT where a Reporting Bank’s exposure to the SFT counterparty increases as the counterparty’s 
credit quality deteriorates; 
(b)  an SFT where the credit quality of the SFT counterparty is positively correlated with the value of the 
securities posted by the counterparty with a Reporting Bank; 
(c) an SFT for which a Reporting Bank in substance acts as a principal, but structures the SFT such that it 
acts as an agent and calculates the EM in respect of the SFT in accordance with paragraph 2.47 or 2.49 
of this Annex; and 
(d) a collateral swap trade or other transaction structured such that a Reporting Bank calculates the EM in 
respect of the transaction to be zero even though the Reporting Bank undertakes leverage through the 
transaction.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-20 
On-balance Sheet Items 
 
2.8 
A Reporting Bank must include the exposure measures in respect of all on-
balance sheet assets (including on-balance sheet collateral for any derivative transaction 
and collateral for any SFT) in the calculation of its TEM. For on-balance sheet assets which 
are not derivative transactions, a Reporting Bank must calculate the EM in respect of such 
on-balance sheet assets, based on their carrying amount as determined in accordance with 
the Accounting Standards, net of specific allowances. A Reporting Bank may deduct 
general allowances that have been set aside against on-balance sheet assets and which 
have reduced CET1 Capital, in the calculation of its TEM.  
 
2.9 
Where a Reporting Bank has leased a tangible asset, the Reporting Bank must 
include the EM in respect of a right of use asset in the calculation of its TEM.  
 
2.10 
A Reporting Bank may exclude in the calculation of its TEM, fiduciary assets that 
meet the criteria for de-recognition and, where applicable, de-consolidation, under the 
Accounting Standards.  
 
2.11 
Where a Reporting Bank uses trade date accounting in its treatment of the 
regular way purchase or sale of financial assets, the Reporting Bank must reverse out any 
offsetting that is recognised in accordance with the Accounting Standards, between cash 
receivables for unsettled sales of financial assets and cash payables for unsettled 
purchases of financial assets. However, the Reporting Bank may recognise offsetting 
between cash receivables for unsettled sales of financial assets and cash payables for 
unsettled purchases of financial assets, regardless of whether such offsetting is recognised 
under the Accounting Standards, where – 
 
(a) 
the financial assets are fair valued through the profit and loss account of 
the financial statements of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank allocates the financial assets to its trading book; and 
 
(c)  the purchase or sale transactions of the financial assets are DvP 
transactions. 
 
2.12 
A Reporting Bank may calculate the EM in respect of a cash pooling arrangement 
based on the combined single account balance where – 
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank physically transfers and combines at least on a daily 
basis, the credit and debit balances of all the participating accounts, into 
a single account balance, such that the Reporting Bank is not liable for the 
balance of any participating account on an individual basis thereafter; or 
 
(b)  all the following conditions are met: 
 
(i)  
the cash pooling arrangement provides for a single designated 
account, in addition to the participating accounts, into which the 
Reporting Bank may transfer the balances of all participating 
accounts, such that the Reporting Bank is not liable for the balance 
of any participating account on an individual basis thereafter; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-21 
(ii)  the Reporting Bank has obtained a written independent legal 
opinion53 that at any point in time, the Reporting Bank has a legally 
enforceable right to perform such transfers, has the discretion and is 
in a position to exercise this right, and that the Reporting Bank is not 
liable for the balance of any participating account on an individual 
basis after such transfer; 
 
(iii)  the Reporting Bank performs such transfers at least on a quarterly 
basis, or such other frequency specified by the Authority; 
 
(iv)  any one of the following conditions are satisfied: 
 
(A)  there are no maturity mismatches among the balances of the 
participating accounts;  
 
(B)  there are maturity mismatches among the balances of the 
participating accounts, but all balances of the participating 
accounts are either overnight or on demand and the Reporting 
Bank does not net any credit balance from the debit balances 
unless – 
 
(I)  withdrawal is conditional upon the debit balances being 
repaid; and 
 
(II)  the condition referred to in sub-paragraph (b)(iv)(B)(I) is 
stipulated in the contractual agreement54 with all 
counterparties to the cash pooling transaction;  
 
(v)  the Reporting Bank charges or pays interest, fees or both interest 
and fees, based only on the net balance of all participating accounts. 
 
 
Derivative Transactions  
  
2.13 
Subject to paragraphs 2.22 and 2.23 of this Annex, for a derivative transaction 
that is not covered by a qualifying bilateral netting agreement, a Reporting Bank must 
calculate the EM in respect of the derivative transaction using the following formula: 
 
𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒= 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 × (𝑅𝐶+ 𝑃𝐹𝐸) 
where – 
 
(a) 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎= 1.4; 
 
 
53  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal counsel, the Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel is independent of the parties originating transactions covered by the cash pooling 
arrangement. 
54  
Such withdrawal restrictions are intended to safeguard against the withdrawal of credit balances prior to a 
default, which would result in such exposure of the Reporting Bank not being captured by the leverage 
ratio. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-22 
(b) 𝑅𝐶= the replacement cost of the derivative transaction calculated using 
the following formula:  
 
𝑅𝐶= max (𝑉−𝐶𝑉𝑀𝑟+ 𝐶𝑉𝑀𝑝, 0) 
where – 
 
(i) 
𝑉= the current market value of the derivative transaction; 
 
(ii) 𝐶𝑉𝑀𝑟= the cash variation margin received by the Reporting Bank 
in relation to the derivative transaction that meets the conditions set 
out in paragraph 2.18 of this Annex and that has not reduced 𝑉 
under the Accounting Standards; and 
 
(iii) 𝐶𝑉𝑀𝑝= the cash variation margin provided by the Reporting Bank 
in relation to the derivative transaction that meets the conditions set 
out in paragraph 2.18 of this Annex; and 
 
(c) 𝑃𝐹𝐸= the potential future exposure of the derivative transaction 
calculated as – 
 
𝑃𝐹𝐸= 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑟× 𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒 
 
in accordance with Sections 3 and 4 of Annex 7D, except that the value of 
the multiplier referred to in paragraph 3.1(b) of Annex 7D must be fixed 
at one. To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank may calculate the maturity factor 
used in the calculation of 𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒, in accordance with paragraphs 
3.36 to 3.39 of Annex 7D (i.e. the Reporting Bank may recognise the PFE-
reducing effect from the regular exchange of variation margin). 
 
2.14 
 
Subject to paragraphs 2.22 and 2.23 of this Annex, for a set of derivative 
transactions that is covered by a qualifying bilateral netting agreement, a Reporting Bank 
must calculate the EM in respect of the netting set using the following formula:   
 
𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒= 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 × (𝑅𝐶+ 𝑃𝐹𝐸) 
where – 
 
(a) 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎= 1.4; 
 
(b) 𝑅𝐶= the replacement cost of the derivative transactions in the netting 
set calculated using the following formula: 
 
𝑅𝐶= max (𝑉−𝐶𝑉𝑀𝑟+ 𝐶𝑉𝑀𝑝, 0) 
where – 
 
(i) 
𝑉= the current market value of the derivative transactions in the 
netting set; 
 
(ii)  𝐶𝑉𝑀𝑟= the cash variation margin received by the Reporting Bank 
in relation to the derivative transactions in the netting set that meets 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-23 
the conditions set out in paragraph 2.18 of this Annex and that has 
not reduced 𝑉 under the Accounting Standards; and 
 
(iii) 𝐶𝑉𝑀𝑝= the cash variation margin provided by the Reporting Bank 
in relation to the derivative transactions in the netting set that meets 
the conditions set out in paragraph 2.18 of this Annex; and 
 
(c)  𝑃𝐹𝐸= the potential future exposure of the derivative transactions in the 
netting set calculated as – 
 
𝑃𝐹𝐸= 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑟× 𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒 
 
in accordance with Sections 3 and 4 of Annex 7D, except that the value of 
the multiplier referred to in paragraph 3.1(b) of Annex 7D must be fixed 
at one. To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank may calculate the maturity factor 
used in the calculation of 𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒, in accordance with paragraphs 
3.36 to 3.39 of Annex 7D (i.e. the Reporting Bank may recognise the PFE-
reducing effect from the regular exchange of variation margin). 
 
2.15 
For the purposes of paragraphs 2.13(b) and 2.14(b) of this Annex, where there 
is no accounting measure of exposure for certain derivative transactions because they are 
held completely off-balance sheet, the Reporting Bank must use the sum of positive fair 
values of these derivative transactions as the replacement cost. 
 
2.16 
A Reporting Bank must include the EM in respect of a written option in the 
calculation of its TEM, even if it is assigned a zero E or EAD for the purposes of credit risk 
capital requirements under Part VII. 
 
2.17 
A Reporting Bank must not reduce the EM in respect of a derivative transaction 
calculated in accordance with paragraph 2.13 or 2.14 of this Annex, whichever is 
applicable, by any collateral received from its counterparty in connection with the 
derivative transaction. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must not net any collateral 
received against the derivative transaction even if such netting is permitted under the 
Accounting Standards or Part VII. Where collateral provided by the Reporting Bank in 
relation to a derivative transaction has reduced the value of its balance sheet assets in 
accordance with the Accounting Standards, the Reporting Bank must gross up the EM in 
respect of the derivative transaction by the amount of such collateral. A Reporting Bank 
must – 
 
(a) 
for the purposes of paragraphs 2.13(b) and 2.14(b) of this Annex, not 
reduce 𝑅𝐶 by any collateral received from its counterparty in connection 
with the derivative transaction; and 
 
(b) 
for the purposes of paragraphs 2.13(c) and 2.14(c) of this Annex, fix the 
value of the multiplier at one, but the Reporting Bank may calculate the 
maturity factor used in the calculation of 𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒 in accordance 
with paragraphs 3.36 to 3.39 of Annex 7D (i.e. the Reporting Bank may 
recognise the PFE-reducing effect from the regular exchange of variation 
margin). 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

This paragraph does not apply to the computation of the EM in respect of a derivative 
transaction calculated under paragraph 2.25 of this Annex. 
 
2.18 
In calculating the EM in respect of a derivative transaction, a Reporting Bank 
may deem the cash portion of variation margin exchanged between counterparties as a 
form of pre-settlement payment (rather than a collateral) and reduce the EM in respect of 
a derivative transaction in accordance with paragraph 2.21 of this Annex, if all of the 
following conditions are met:  
 
(a) 
for trades not cleared through a qualifying CCP, the cash received by the 
recipient counterparty is not segregated, i.e. there are no restrictions 
imposed on the recipient counterparty by law, regulation or any 
agreement, which restrict the recipient counterparty’s ability to use the 
cash received; 
 
(b) 
the variation margin is calculated and exchanged on a daily basis based 
on mark-to-market valuation of the derivative transaction, and the 
variation margin may be exchanged on the morning of the subsequent 
trading day based on the previous end-of-day market values;  
 
(c) 
the cash portion of the variation margin is received in a currency specified 
in – 
 
(i) 
the derivative contract;  
 
(ii) 
an agreement to net that covers the derivative transaction, with the 
counterparty or the CCP; or  
 
(iii) a credit support annex to an agreement to net mentioned in sub-
paragraph (c)(ii); 
 
(d) 
the variation margin exchanged is the full amount necessary to fully 
extinguish the mark-to-market exposure of the derivative transaction 
subject to the margin threshold and minimum transfer amounts applicable 
to the counterparty;  
 
(e) 
the derivatives transaction and variation margin are covered by a single 
agreement to net between the counterparties in the derivatives 
transaction and the agreement to net –  
 
(i) 
explicitly stipulates that the counterparties agree to settle on a net 
basis any obligation covered by such an agreement to net, taking 
into account any variation margin received or provided if a credit 
event occurs involving either counterparty;  
 
(ii) 
is legally enforceable and effective in all relevant countries or 
jurisdictions within the meaning of paragraph 3.1(a) of Annex 7G, 
including in the event of default, insolvency, and bankruptcy; and 
 
(iii) does not contain a walkaway clause; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-25 
(f) 
the Reporting Bank has obtained a written independent legal opinion55 
confirming that the agreement to net meets the criteria in sub-paragraph 
(e). 
 
2.19 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.18(c) and (e) of this Annex, an agreement to 
net is any agreement that provides a legally enforceable right of offset, and a Reporting 
Bank may deem a master agreement to net as a single agreement to net. 
 
2.20 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.18(d) of this Annex, where a margin dispute 
arises, a Reporting Bank must not recognise any variation margin as the variation margin 
exchanged, other than the amount of non-disputed variation margin that has been 
exchanged. 
 
2.21 
Pursuant to paragraph 2.18 of this Annex, if all of the conditions in paragraph 
2.18 of this Annex are met, a Reporting Bank may – 
 
(a) 
reduce the replacement cost calculated in accordance with paragraph 
2.13(b) or 2.14(b) of this Annex, whichever is applicable, by the amount 
of the cash portion of the variation margin received, if the positive mark-
to-market value of the derivative transaction or transactions is not already 
reduced by the same amount of the cash portion of the variation margin 
received in accordance with the Accounting Standards; or  
 
(b)   in respect of the cash portion of the variation margin provided to a 
counterparty, where the cash portion of the variation margin has been 
recognised as an asset in accordance with the Accounting Standards, 
deduct the resulting receivable in the calculation of its TEM, and instead 
include the cash portion of the variation margin provided in the calculation 
of 𝑅𝐶 via the term 𝐶𝑉𝑀𝑝.  
 
To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must not use the cash portion of the variation margin 
received by the Reporting Bank to reduce the potential future exposure calculated in 
accordance with paragraph 2.13(c) or 2.14(c) of this Annex. 
 
2.22 
Where a Reporting Bank, acting as a clearing member of a qualifying CCP, offers 
clearing services for derivative transactions to a client, the Reporting Bank may exclude 
the EM in respect of the CCP trade exposures to the qualifying CCP in the calculation of the 
EM in respect of the derivative transaction if the Reporting Bank is not obligated, based 
on the contractual arrangements with the client, to reimburse the client for any losses 
suffered due to changes in the value of its derivative transactions in the event that the 
qualifying CCP defaults. To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must include the EM in respect 
of the CCP trade exposures based on the treatment for derivative transactions specified in 
this Annex, where – 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank, in acting as a clearing member of a qualifying CCP, is 
obligated to reimburse the client for any losses suffered due to changes in 
 
55  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal counsel, the Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel is independent of the parties originating transactions covered by the agreement to net. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-26 
the value of the client’s transactions in the event that the qualifying CCP 
defaults; or 
 
(b) 
the CCP trade exposures are to a CCP that is not a qualifying CCP. 
 
2.23 
Where a Reporting Bank is a higher level client in a multi-level client structure, 
and offers clearing services to a client for a derivative transaction that is cleared by a 
qualifying CCP, the Reporting Bank may exclude the EM in respect of the resulting CCP 
trade exposure to a clearing member or to an entity that is a higher level client to the 
Reporting Bank, in the calculation of the EM in respect of the derivative transaction if all 
of the following conditions are met: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must confirm that the offsetting transaction in respect 
of the derivative transaction is identified by the qualifying CCP as a higher 
level client transaction; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must obtain a written independent legal opinion56 
which concludes that – 
 
(i)  
the collateral is held by the qualifying CCP or the clearing member, 
or both, to support the offsetting transaction in respect of the 
derivative transaction, under one or more arrangements that prevent 
any losses to the Reporting Bank due to –  
 
(A) the default or insolvency of the clearing member; 
 
(B) the default or insolvency of other clients of the clearing 
member; and 
 
(C) the joint default or insolvency of the clearing member and any 
of its other clients;  
 
(ii)  under the arrangements in sub-paragraph (b)(i), upon the 
insolvency of the clearing member, there is no legal impediment 
(other than the need to obtain a court order to which the client is 
entitled) to the transfer of the collateral belonging to clients of the 
defaulting clearing member to the qualifying CCP, to one or more 
other surviving clearing members, or to clients or their respective 
nominees; and 
 
(iii) the arrangements in sub-paragraph (b)(i) are binding on all relevant 
parties and legally enforceable in all relevant countries or 
jurisdictions within the meaning of paragraph 3.1(a) of Annex 7G; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the arrangements in sub-paragraph 
(b)(i) do not cease to be enforceable and there continues to be no legal 
impediment under sub-paragraph (b)(ii); 
 
56  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal counsel, the Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel is independent of the parties originating transactions related to the Reporting Bank’s client 
clearing services. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-27 
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the laws, regulation, rules, 
contractual arrangements and administrative arrangements, that govern 
the derivative transaction between the Reporting Bank and the clearing 
member or higher level client, as the case may be – 
 
(i) 
provide that the offsetting transaction in respect of the derivative 
transaction with a clearing member that has defaulted, or an 
insolvent clearing member, will continue to be indirectly transacted 
through the qualifying CCP, or by the qualifying CCP, should the 
clearing member default or become insolvent; and 
 
(ii) 
allow for the Reporting Bank’s positions and collateral placed with 
the qualifying CCP to be transferred at market value unless the 
Reporting Bank requests to close out at market value; 
 
(e) 
the Reporting Bank must not be obligated, based on any contractual 
arrangements with its client, to reimburse the client for any losses suffered 
in the event that the qualifying CCP or the clearing member defaults. 
 
2.24 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.23(d) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
consider all of the following factors when assessing if the offsetting transaction in respect 
of the derivative transaction will continue to be indirectly transacted:  
 
(a) 
whether there is a precedent for transactions being ported to another 
clearing member or the qualifying CCP; 
 
(b) 
whether there is any reason for the Reporting Bank to believe that the 
industry practice for such precedent to continue, will be changed. 
 
The Reporting Bank must not determine that the criteria in paragraph 2.23(d) of this Annex 
is met solely on the basis that there is no prohibition against the porting of client trades 
in any documentation provided by the qualifying CCP, including in rules imposed by or 
agreements entered into with, the qualifying CCP, that govern transactions transacted with 
or through the qualifying CCP. 
 
2.25 
Where a Reporting Bank offers clearing services for derivative transactions to a 
client for derivative transactions that are cleared by a qualifying CCP or a CCP that is not 
a qualifying CCP, whether by acting as a clearing member of the CCP or by acting as a 
higher level client within a multi-level client structure, the Reporting Bank must determine 
the EM in respect of its exposure to the client as E calculated in accordance with paragraphs 
1.1 to 1.3 and 2.4 to 5.4 of Annex 7D, subject to paragraph 2.26 of this Annex.  
 
2.26 
In determining the EM in respect of its exposure to the client, the Reporting 
Bank must restrict the amount of initial margin received by the Reporting Bank from the 
client, that may be included in the values of 𝐶 and 𝑁𝐼𝐶𝐴 for the purposes of determining 
𝑅𝐶 and 𝑃𝐹𝐸, to the amount for which the Reporting Bank records and maintains a 
separate book entry in relation to the client’s money or other assets received from each 
client under the laws governing the Reporting Bank’s handling or custody of client assets. 
 
2.27 
For the purposes of paragraphs 2.22 to 2.24 and 2.28 of this Annex, where a 
Reporting Bank offers clearing services for a derivative transaction to an affiliate of the 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-28 
Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank must consider the entity as a client if the entity is 
outside the regulatory scope of consolidation at the level at which the leverage ratio is 
being calculated. Where the entity is within the regulatory scope of consolidation at the 
level at which the leverage ratio is being calculated57, the Reporting Bank must include the 
EM in respect of the Reporting Bank’s trade exposure to the CCP resulting from the 
Reporting Bank’s provision of clearing services for the derivative transaction, calculated in 
accordance with paragraphs 2.22 to 2.24 of this Annex, in the calculation of the EM in 
respect of the derivative transaction. 
 
2.28 
Where a client enters directly into a derivative transaction with the CCP and the 
Reporting Bank acting as a clearing member for the client to the CCP, guarantees the 
performance of its client’s CCP trade exposures to the CCP for the transaction, the 
Reporting Bank must calculate the EM in respect of the guarantee as an EM in respect of 
the derivative transaction as set out in paragraphs 2.13 to 2.21 of this Annex, as if the 
Reporting Bank had entered directly into the transaction with the client, including with 
regard to the receipt or provision of the cash portion of the variation margin. 
 
2.29 
For the purposes of paragraphs 2.22 to 2.24 and 2.27 of this Annex, CCP trade 
exposures include initial margin posted to the CCP, irrespective of whether or not such 
margin is posted in a manner that makes it remote from the insolvency of the CCP. 
 
 
Written Credit Derivatives  
 
2.30 
For the purposes of paragraphs 2.31 to 2.39 of this Annex – 
 
(a) 
“written credit derivative” refers to a credit derivative through which a 
Reporting Bank sells credit protection to a third party, and includes a credit 
default swap, a total return swap and an option where a Reporting Bank 
has the obligation to provide credit protection; and 
 
(b) 
“effective notional amount” in relation to a written credit derivative, means 
an amount obtained by adjusting the notional amount of the written credit 
derivative to reflect the true exposure of the written credit derivative that 
is leveraged or otherwise enhanced by the structure of the transaction. 
 
2.31 
In addition to the treatment for derivative transactions, which would include 
written credit derivatives, set out in paragraphs 2.13 to 2.29 of this Annex, a Reporting 
Bank must include, subject to paragraphs 2.32 to 2.39 of this Annex, in the EM in respect 
of a written credit derivative, the effective notional amount of the written credit derivative, 
unless – 
 
(a) 
the written credit derivative is included in a transaction for which the 
Reporting Bank provides clearing services to a client by acting as a clearing 
member of a qualifying CCP, and the transaction meets the conditions in 
paragraph 2.22 of this Annex such that the Reporting Bank may exclude 
its CCP trade exposures in the calculation of the EM in respect of the 
derivative transaction; or 
 
 
57  
In such a case, the Reporting Bank’s trade exposure to the entity is eliminated in the course of 
consolidation, but the Reporting Bank still has a trade exposure to the CCP. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-29 
(b) 
the written credit derivative is included in a transaction for which the 
Reporting Bank provides clearing services to a client by acting as a higher 
level client in a multi-level client structure, and the transaction meets the 
conditions in paragraph 2.23 of this Annex such that the Reporting Bank 
may exclude the EM in respect of the resulting trade exposures to – 
 
 
(i) 
the clearing member; or  
  
(ii) 
an entity that serves as a higher level client to the Reporting Bank, 
 
in the calculation of the EM in respect of the derivative transaction. 
 
2.32 
For the purposes of calculating the effective notional amount of a written credit 
derivative, a Reporting Bank may reduce the effective notional amount by any negative 
change in fair value amount that has been incorporated into the calculation of CM with 
respect to the written credit derivative.  
 
2.33 
The Reporting Bank may further reduce the resulting amount (derived pursuant 
to paragraph 2.32 of this Annex) by the effective notional amount of a purchased credit 
derivative on an identical reference name if – 
 
(a) 
the material terms which the credit protection purchased through the 
purchased credit derivative is subject to, are the same or more 
conservative than the material terms in the corresponding written credit 
derivative, such that the credit protection purchased will deliver a payment 
in all potential future states in which the corresponding written credit 
derivative is triggered;  
 
(b) 
the remaining maturity of the purchased credit derivative is equal to or 
greater than the remaining maturity of the written credit derivative; 
 
(c) 
the purchased credit derivative is not purchased from a counterparty 
whose credit quality is positively correlated with the value of the reference 
obligation of the written credit derivative. The absence of a legal 
connection between the counterparty and the underlying reference name 
of the written credit derivative does not preclude such a positive 
correlation; 
 
(d) 
where the effective notional amount of the written credit derivative is 
reduced by any negative change in fair value amount that has been 
incorporated into the calculation of the CM with respect to the written 
credit derivative, the Reporting Bank also reduces the effective notional 
amount of the purchased credit derivative by any resulting positive change 
in fair value that has been incorporated into the calculation of the CM with 
respect to the purchased credit derivative. Where the Reporting Bank does 
not reduce the effective notional amount of the purchased credit derivative 
by any resulting positive change in fair value that has been incorporated 
into the calculation of the CM with respect to the purchased credit 
derivative, the Reporting Bank may only offset the effective notional 
amount of the corresponding written credit derivative if the effective 
notional amount of the written credit derivative has not been reduced by 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-30 
any negative change in fair value that has been incorporated into the 
calculation of the CM with respect to the written credit derivative; and 
 
(e) 
the purchased credit derivative is not included in a transaction for which – 
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank provides clearing services to a client (whether by 
acting as a clearing member of a qualifying CCP or by acting as a 
higher level client in a multi-level client structure); and 
 
(ii) 
the effective notional amount of the corresponding written credit 
derivative is excluded from the EM in respect of the written credit 
derivative in accordance with paragraph 2.31 of this Annex. 
 
2.34 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.33 of this Annex, in the case of a written credit 
derivative which is an option where a Reporting Bank has the obligation to provide credit 
protection, the effective notional amount of such an option sold by the Reporting Bank 
may be offset by the effective notional amount of an option by which the Reporting Bank 
has the right to purchase credit protection, provided the conditions in paragraph 2.33(a) 
to (e) of this Annex are met.  
 
2.35 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank may offset the effective notional amount of a 
written credit derivative sold to a client by means of a credit derivative on an identical 
reference name purchased from a CCP, provided the conditions in paragraph 2.33(a) to 
(e) of this Annex are met. 
 
2.36 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.33(a) of this Annex, “material terms” include 
the level of subordination, optionality, credit events, reference obligation and any other 
characteristics relevant to the valuation of the derivative. The criterion set out in paragraph 
2.33(a) of this Annex would be met only where – 
 
(a) 
in the case of an option to provide credit protection, the strike price of the 
underlying purchased credit derivative is equal to or lower than the strike 
price of the underlying written credit derivative; 
 
(b) 
in the case of a written single name credit derivative, the purchased credit 
derivative references an obligation which – 
 
(i) 
ranks pari passu with the reference obligation of the written credit 
derivative; or 
 
(ii) 
is junior to the reference obligation of the written credit derivative, 
and a credit event on the reference obligation of the written credit 
derivative will always result in a credit event on the reference 
obligation of the purchased credit derivative; and 
 
(c) 
in the case of an exposure which is a tranche, the purchased credit 
derivative references an obligation with the same level of seniority as the 
reference obligation of the written credit derivative. 
 
2.37 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.33 of this Annex, 2 reference names are 
considered identical only if they refer to the same legal entity. A Reporting Bank may offset 
the written credit derivatives on individual reference names with credit protection 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-31 
purchased through credit derivatives on a pool of reference names if the credit protection 
purchased is economically equivalent to purchasing credit protection separately on each 
of the individual reference names in the pool.58 If a Reporting Bank purchases credit 
protection on a pool of reference names through credit derivatives, but the credit 
protection does not cover the entire pool59, then the Reporting Bank must not offset the 
written credit derivatives on individual reference names. A Reporting Bank may offset 
written credit derivatives on a pool of reference names (or subset thereof) with credit 
protection purchased on a pool of reference names (or subset thereof) through credit 
derivatives provided that both instruments reference the same pool (or subset thereof) of 
reference names and the level of subordination of the reference obligations is identical 
under both instruments. 
 
2.38 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.33 of this Annex, where a Reporting Bank 
purchases credit protection through a total return swap and records the net payments 
received as net income, but does not record offsetting deterioration in the value of the 
written credit derivative (either through reductions in fair value or by an addition to 
reserves) in its CM, the Reporting Bank must not recognise the credit protection for the 
purposes of offsetting the effective notional amounts related to written credit derivatives. 
 
2.39 
For the purposes of calculating the amount for potential future exposure as set 
out in paragraphs 2.13(c) and 2.14(c) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank may exclude from 
the netting set for the potential future exposure calculation, the individual potential future 
exposure amount relating to a written credit derivative provided that – 
 
(a)   such individual potential future exposure amount is not offset by the 
effective notional amount of a purchased credit derivative under 
paragraph 2.33 of this Annex; and 
 
(b)    the effective notional amount of the written credit derivative is included in 
the calculation of the EM in respect of the written credit derivative under 
paragraph 2.31 of this Annex.  
 
 
SFTs  
 
2.40 
Where a Reporting Bank acts as a principal in an SFT, the Reporting Bank must 
calculate the EM in respect of the SFT by adding –   
 
(a) 
the gross SFT assets recognised in accordance with the Accounting 
Standards (i.e. with no recognition of accounting netting of cash payables 
against cash receivables) with the following adjustments:  
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank must exclude the value of any collateral received 
under the SFT, where the Reporting Bank has recognised the 
collateral as an asset on its balance sheet;  
 
 
58  
For example, this would be the case if a Reporting Bank were to purchase credit protection on an entire 
securitisation structure. 
59  
This means that the credit protection covers only a subset of the pool, as in the case of an nth-to-default 
credit derivative or a securitisation tranche. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-32 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank may net the cash payables and cash receivables 
in the SFTs with the same counterparty if all of the following criteria 
are met: 
 
(A)  the SFTs have the same explicit final settlement date. An SFT 
with no explicit final settlement date but which can be unwound 
at any time by either party to the SFT would not satisfy this 
criterion; 
 
(B)  the right to set off the amount owed to the counterparty with 
the amount owed by the counterparty is legally enforceable 
both currently in the normal course of business and in the event 
of default, insolvency, and bankruptcy;  
 
(C)  the counterparties intend to settle net or settle simultaneously, 
or the SFTs are subject to a settlement mechanism that results 
in the functional equivalent of net settlement i.e. the cash flows 
of the SFTs are equivalent, in effect, to a single net amount on 
the settlement date; and 
  
(b) 
the SFT counterparty exposure calculated in accordance with the following 
formula:  
 
(i) 
where the Reporting Bank has entered into a qualifying agreement 
to net with the counterparty –  
 
CESFT* = max {0, [∑(CESFT,i) - ∑(CSFT,i)]} 
 
where –  
 
(A) “CESFT*” refers to the SFT counterparty exposure; 
 
(B) “∑(CESFT, i)” refers to the total fair value of collateral and cash 
lent to the counterparty for all SFTs included in the qualifying 
agreement to net; and 
 
(C) “∑(CSFT, i)” refers to the total fair value of collateral and cash 
received from the counterparty for all SFTs included in the 
qualifying agreement to net; and   
 
(ii) 
where the Reporting Bank has not entered into a qualifying 
agreement to net with the counterparty, calculate for each SFT –  
 
 
CESFT, i* = max {0, [(CESFT, i) - (CSFT, i)]} 
 
 
where –  
 
(A) “CESFT, i *” refers to the SFT counterparty exposure for an SFT, 
i; 
 
(B) “CESFT, i” refers to the fair value of collateral and cash lent to 
the counterparty for the SFT, i; and 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-33 
 
(C) “CSFT, i” refers to the fair value of collateral and cash received 
from the counterparty for the SFT, i.   
 
However, a Reporting Bank may set CESFT, i* to zero where CESFT, i 
comprises only the cash lent to a counterparty, and the cash 
receivables arising from the cash lent to the counterparty is not 
eligible for the netting treatment set out in sub-paragraph (a). 
 
2.41 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.40(a) of this Annex, where the SFT assets are 
subject to novation and cleared through a qualifying CCP, a Reporting Bank must use the 
final contractual exposure after the process of novation has been applied, in place of gross 
SFT assets. In calculating the final contractual exposure, a Reporting Bank may only net 
the cash payables and cash receivables with a qualifying CCP if the criteria in paragraph 
2.40(a)(ii) of this Annex are met. A Reporting Bank must not recognise any other netting 
for the purposes of calculating the EM in respect of the SFT, even if such netting is 
permitted by a qualifying CCP.  
 
2.42 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.40(a)(ii)(C) of this Annex, cash flows of SFTs 
are equivalent only if –  
 
(a) 
the SFTs are settled through the same settlement system;  
 
(b) 
the settlement arrangements are supported by cash, or intraday credit 
facilities, or both, intended to ensure that settlement of the SFTs will occur 
by the end of the business day; and  
 
(c) 
any issues arising from the collateral leg of the SFTs do not interfere with 
the completion of the net settlement of the cash receivables and 
payables60. Where there is a failure of the collateral leg of an SFT in such 
a mechanism at the end of the window for settlement in the settlement 
mechanism, a Reporting Bank must split out the SFT, including its 
matching cash leg, from the netting set and measure the EM in respect of 
the SFT on a gross basis.  
 
2.43 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.40(b) of this Annex, a qualifying agreement to 
net is an agreement to net that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
(a) 
be legally enforceable in each relevant country or jurisdiction within the 
meaning of paragraph 3.1(a) of Annex 7G upon the occurrence of an event 
of default and regardless of whether the counterparty is insolvent or 
bankrupt; 
 
(b) 
provide the non-defaulting party with the right to terminate and close out 
in a timely manner all SFTs under the agreement upon an event of default, 
including in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the counterparty;  
 
 
60  
This means that the failure of any single collateral leg in the settlement mechanism delays settlement of 
only the matching cash leg or creates an obligation to the settlement mechanism, supported by an 
associated credit facility. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-34 
(c) 
provide for the netting of gains and losses on SFTs (including the value of 
any collateral) terminated and closed out under it so that a single net 
amount is owed by one party to the other;  
 
(d) 
allow for the prompt liquidation or setoff of collateral upon the event of 
default. 
 
Prior to treating an agreement to net as a qualifying agreement to net, a Reporting Bank 
must obtain a written independent opinion61 confirming that the agreement to net meets 
the criteria in this paragraph.  
 
2.44 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.40(b)(i) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank may 
recognise netting across positions in the banking book and trading book only if –  
 
(a) 
all SFTs are marked to market daily; and 
 
(b) 
the collateral used in the SFTs is an eligible financial collateral in the 
banking book as set out in Annex 7H. 
 
2.45 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.40(b)(i)(B) and (ii)(B) of this Annex, in the 
case of a triparty repo, the term “∑(CESFT,i)” or “CESFT, i”, as the case may be, includes 
collateral deposited at a triparty repo agent up to the amount effectively lent to the 
counterparty in the SFT, but excludes excess collateral that the Reporting Bank has 
deposited at a triparty repo agent but which has not been lent out. 
 
2.46 
Where a Reporting Bank has accounted for its SFT using sales accounting, the 
Reporting Bank must reverse all sales-related accounting entries and calculate the EM in 
respect of the SFT in accordance with paragraph 2.40 of this Annex as if the SFT had been 
treated as a financing transaction in accordance with the Accounting Standards. 
 
2.47 
Where a Reporting Bank acting as an agent in an SFT62 provides an indemnity 
or guarantee to a customer or counterparty for the difference between the value of the 
collateral or cash the customer or counterparty has lent and the value of the collateral the 
borrower has provided, the Reporting Bank must calculate the EM in respect of the SFT by 
applying only paragraph 2.40(b) of this Annex if – 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank does not own or control the underlying cash or 
security; and 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank’s exposure to the SFT is limited to the guaranteed 
difference between the value of the collateral or cash its customer or 
counterparty has lent and the value of the collateral the borrower has 
provided. 
 
 
61  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal counsel, the Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel is independent of the parties originating SFTs covered by the agreement to net.  
62  
The Reporting Bank generally provides an indemnity or guarantee to one of the 2 parties involved, and 
only for the difference between the value of the security or cash its customer or counterparty has lent and 
the value of the collateral the borrower has provided. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-35 
2.48 
Despite paragraph 2.47 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must also include the 
full amount of the collateral or cash in the EM in respect of the SFT where the Reporting 
Bank is economically exposed beyond the guaranteed difference to the underlying 
collateral or cash.63 This paragraph does not apply to client omnibus accounts that are 
used by agent lenders to hold and manage client collateral provided that client collateral 
is segregated from the Reporting Bank’s proprietary assets and the Reporting Bank 
calculates the exposure on a client-by-client basis.  
 
2.49 
Subject to paragraphs 2.47 and 2.48 of this Annex, where the Reporting Bank 
acting as an agent in an SFT, does not provide an indemnity or guarantee to any of the 
parties involved in the SFT, the Reporting Bank may exclude the EM in respect of the SFT 
in the calculation of its TEM. 
 
2.50 
 
Where a Reporting Bank acting as an agent in an SFT provides an indemnity or 
guarantee to both parties involved in the SFT, the Reporting Bank must calculate the EM 
in respect of the SFT by applying paragraphs 2.40 to 2.49 of this Annex separately for 
each party involved in the SFT. 
 
 
Off-balance Sheet Items 
 
2.51 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the EM in respect of an off-balance sheet item64 
by multiplying the notional amount for the item with –  
 
(a) 
the applicable CCF set out in Annex 4D for an off-balance sheet item other 
than an off-balance sheet securitisation item; and  
 
(b) 
the applicable CCF set out in Annex 7C for an off-balance sheet 
securitisation item. 
 
2.52 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.51 of this Annex, the notional amount of an 
off-balance sheet item refers to the amount which has been committed but is as yet 
undrawn. A Reporting Bank must measure the notional amount of an off-balance sheet 
item denominated in a foreign currency, based on the current exchange rate. The 
Reporting Bank must apply the CCF to the lower of the value of the unused committed 
credit line, and the value which reflects any possible constraining availability of the 
 
63  
For example, due to the Reporting Bank managing collateral received in the Reporting Bank’s name or on 
its own account rather than on the customer’s or borrower’s account (e.g. by on-lending or managing 
unsegregated collateral, cash or securities). 
64  
A Reporting Bank should record a commitment (as defined in Annex 2A) as an exposure for leverage ratio 
purposes on the date it enters into the legal contract or agreement with the obligor, except in the following 
cases:     
(a) where the Reporting Bank faces operational constraints in recording the commitment immediately, 
such as checking that the legal contract or agreement is in order, such delay should not exceed 15 
business days; 
(b) where the commitment is in respect of a credit facility to an obligor which is to be used for the purposes 
of repaying an existing credit facility issued by the Reporting Bank to the same obligor, such as for 
refinancing, the Reporting Bank should record the commitment on the date at which the existing credit 
exposure will be repaid. In the case where the amount for the commitment exceeds the outstanding 
amount to be repaid for the existing credit exposure, the Reporting Bank should recognise the 
difference on the date at which the legal contract or agreement or commitment is entered into by the 
Reporting Bank, subject to sub-paragraph (a). 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
 4-36 
facility65. Where a Reporting Bank contends that the availability of a facility is constrained, 
the Reporting Bank must have sufficient line monitoring and management procedures to 
support this contention. 
 
2.53 
A Reporting Bank may reduce the EM in respect of an off-balance sheet item by 
the amount of specific allowances and general allowances that have been set aside against 
the off-balance sheet item and which have reduced CET1 Capital, subject to the EM in 
respect of the off-balance sheet item not being less than zero. 
 
 
 
65  
An example is the existence of a ceiling on the potential lending amount which is related to an obligor’s 
reported cash flow.

Annex 4D 
 
CCF FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS OTHER THAN SECURITISATION ITEMS 
UNDER THE LEVERAGE RATIO 
 
1.1 
Table 4D-1 sets out the CCFs for off-balance sheet items other than 
securitisation items. 
 
1.2 
Where a Reporting Bank undertakes to provide a commitment on another off-
balance sheet item, a Reporting Bank must apply the lower of the applicable CCFs set out 
in Table 4D-166. 
 
Table 4D-1 – CCF for off-balance sheet items 
 
Description of Off-balance Sheet Item 
CCF 
(a) 
Direct credit substitutes67  
100% 
(b) 
Sale and repurchase agreements and asset sales with 
recourse (other than SFTs), where the credit risk remains 
with the Reporting Bank 
100% 
(c) 
Commitments with certain drawdown, including forward 
purchases, forward deposits, and partly paid shares and 
securities 
100% 
(d) 
Credit substitutes which are not explicitly included in (a) to 
(c) 
100% 
(e) 
Commitments to pay for unsettled purchases of financial 
assets, where the Reporting Bank treats the regular way 
purchase or sale of financial assets using settlement date 
accounting. 
 
The Reporting Bank may offset commitments to pay for 
unsettled purchases of financial assets by the amount of cash 
to be received for unsettled sales of financial assets where - 
(i) 
the financial assets are fair valued through the profit 
and loss account of the financial statements of the 
Reporting Bank; 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank allocates the financial assets to its 
trading book; and 
(iii) the purchase or sale transactions of the financial assets 
are DvP transactions. 
100% 
(f) 
Note issuance facilities and revolving underwriting facilities, 
regardless of the maturity of the underlying facility 
50% 
 
66  
For example, if a Reporting Bank has a commitment to open short-term self-liquidating trade letters of 
credit arising from the movement of goods, a 20% CCF must be applied (instead of a 40% CCF). If a 
Reporting Bank has an unconditionally cancellable commitment to issue direct credit substitutes, a 10% 
CCF must be applied (instead of a 100% CCF). 
67  
For example, general guarantees of indebtedness (including standby letters of credit serving as financial 
guarantees for loans and securities), or acceptances (including endorsements with the character of 
acceptances).

(h) 
Other commitments, regardless of the maturity of the 
underlying facility, unless such other commitments fall 
within the scope of item (i) or (j)   
40% 
(i) 
Self-liquidating trade-related contingent items69  arising from 
the movement of goods with an original maturity of below 
one year. This paragraph is applicable where the Reporting 
Bank is the issuing bank or the confirming bank, of such 
commitments. 
20% 
(j) 
Commitments which are unconditionally cancellable at any 
time by the Reporting Bank without prior notice, or that 
effectively provide for automatic cancellation due to 
deterioration in an obligor’s creditworthiness 
10% 
 
1.3 
Where the Reporting Bank makes a commitment to provide a loan that is to be 
drawn down in a number of tranches, the Reporting Bank must classify the commitment 
under item (h) of Table 4D-1 and apply 40% CCF to the full undisbursed portion of the 
loan, regardless of whether the commitment falls within the scope of another item in  
Table 4D-1.  
 
1.4 
For any item referred to in item (j) of Table 4D-1, where the Authority assesses 
that a 10% CCF does not adequately capture the exposure arising from such a 
commitment, the Authority may direct the Reporting Bank to apply a higher CCF to the 
commitment.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
68  
For example, performance bonds, bid bonds, warranties or standby letters of credit related to particular 
transactions. 
69  
For example, documentary credits collateralised by the underlying shipments.

PART V:  OUTPUT FLOOR 
 
 
5.1.1 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its output floor as the sum of its credit RWA, 
market RWA, and operational RWA, calculated using only standardised approaches, 
multiplied by the output floor calibration. 
 
5.1.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.1.1, “standardised approaches” refers to the 
approaches set out in column (b) of Table 5-1, subject to paragraph 5.1.5. Where the 
Reporting Bank is using a nominated approach or a combination of nominated approaches, 
set out in column (a) of Table 5-1 to calculate the RWA for an exposure, for the purposes 
of paragraph 5.1.1, the Reporting Bank must calculate the RWA for the same exposure 
using the corresponding standardised approach or combination of standardised 
approaches, set out in column (b) of Table 5-1, subject to paragraph 5.1.5.

Division 1:  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital 
 
 
 Components of CET1 Capital  
 
6.1.1 
A Reporting Bank must ensure its CET1 Capital is calculated as the sum of the 
following items, at both the Solo and Group levels:  
 
(a) 
paid-up ordinary shares of the Reporting Bank that comply with the 
requirements in paragraph 6.1.2; 
 
(b) 
share premium, resulting from the issuance of ordinary shares which fall 
within sub-paragraph (a), if any;  
 
(c) 
retained earnings70, after deducting any interim or final dividends which 
have been declared by the Board of the Reporting Bank or any banking 
group entity on any class of shares and any interim losses incurred since 
the end of the last financial reporting period and may include any interim 
profits earned since the end of the last financial reporting period where 
the following conditions are met:  
 
(i) 
every quarterly financial statement is prepared using the same 
accounting policies and practices applied in the preparation of the 
year-end financial statements, unless the change in the accounting 
policy or practice is in accordance with any statutory requirement;  
 
(ii) 
every quarterly financial statement and every significant transaction 
is reviewed in a timely manner by an external auditor;  
 
(iii) the external auditor of the Reporting Bank has not expressed a 
qualified opinion on any of the quarterly financial statements in the 
preceding 12 months of the end of the interim financial reporting 
period; 
 
(d) 
accumulated other comprehensive income and other disclosed reserves, 
other than revaluation surpluses on land and building assets, accumulated 
revaluation gains from investment properties and regulatory loss 
allowances; 
 
(e) 
45% of revaluation surpluses on land and building assets and accumulated 
revaluation gains from investment properties, where the following 
conditions pertaining to revaluations are satisfied:  
 
(i) 
the valuation of any land and building asset or investment property 
is obtained from a qualified property valuer and the increase in value 
 
70  
CET1 capital of the Group may include earnings of associates and joint ventures accounted for under the

is recorded as a revaluation surplus or gain in the financial 
statements;  
 
(ii) 
a new valuation from a qualified property valuer in respect of the 
land and building asset or investment property is obtained – 
 
(A) 
at least once every 3 years; or 
 
(B) 
where the value of the land and building asset or investment 
property has been substantially impaired by any event,  
 
whichever is earlier; 
 
(iii) impairment charges taken against any land and building asset or 
investment property are not netted against revaluation surplus or 
gain from any other asset;   
 
(iv) the external auditor of the Reporting Bank has not expressed a 
qualified opinion on the revaluation of any land and building asset or 
investment property; 
 
(f) 
paid-up ordinary shares issued by fully consolidated subsidiaries of the 
Reporting Bank and held by third party investors (i.e. minority interest) 
that meet the criteria for inclusion in CET1 Capital pursuant to paragraph 
6.1.10;  
 
(g) 
regulatory adjustments set out in paragraph 6.1.5.  
 
 
Minimum Requirements for Paid-Up Ordinary Shares 
 
6.1.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 6.1.1(a), a Reporting Bank must not include a 
paid-up ordinary share of the Reporting Bank as CET1 Capital unless –  
 
(a) 
the ordinary share represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation; 
 
(b) 
the entitlement of ordinary shareholders to a claim on the residual assets 
is proportional to their share of issued share capital, after all senior claims 
have been repaid in liquidation. In this regard, the claims of such holders 
are unlimited and variable (i.e. not fixed or capped); 
 
(c) 
the amount paid-up by ordinary shareholders is perpetual and is not repaid 
outside of liquidation. This excludes discretionary repurchases by the 
Reporting Bank or other means of reducing capital in a discretionary 
manner that is allowable under written law;  
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank does not create an expectation at issuance that the 
ordinary shares will be bought back, redeemed or cancelled, nor do the 
contractual terms provide any feature that might give rise to such an 
expectation;  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-3 
(e) 
distributions in respect of ordinary shares (“distributions”) are only paid 
by the Reporting Bank to the extent that the Reporting Bank has profits 
distributable under written law. The level of distributions is not tied or 
linked to the amount paid-up at issuance, and is not subject to a 
contractual cap, except to the extent that the Reporting Bank is unable to 
pay distributions that exceed the level of profits distributable under 
written law. In the case where the Reporting Bank does not earn any 
distributable profit, the Reporting Bank may distribute dividends as long 
as the Reporting Bank meets the minimum capital ratios to which it is 
subject, and does not exceed any of the distribution constraints of the 
capital conservation and countercyclical buffers, as set out in Part IV. 
Accordingly, the Reporting Bank may pay dividends out of reserves 
available for distribution including those reserves accumulated in prior 
years, provided that it observes the minimum capital ratios and 
distribution constraints of the capital conservation and countercyclical 
buffers; 
 
(f) 
there are no circumstances under which distributions are obligatory and 
the non-payment of distributions is not an event of default; 
 
(g) 
distributions are only paid after all legal and contractual obligations have 
been met, and after payments on  AT1 capital instruments and Tier 2 
capital instruments have been made. In this regard, there are no 
preferential distributions, including in respect of other CET1 capital 
instruments; 
 
(h) 
the ordinary share takes the first and proportionately greatest share of 
any losses as they occur.71 In this regard, it absorbs losses on a going-
concern basis proportionately and pari passu with all other CET1 capital 
instruments;  
 
(i) 
the amount paid-up by ordinary shareholders is recognised as equity and 
not a liability, for the purposes of determining balance sheet insolvency;  
 
(j) 
the amount paid-up by ordinary shareholders is classified as equity under 
the Accounting Standards;  
 
(k) 
the ordinary share is directly issued and fully paid-up in cash, and 
purchase of the ordinary share is not directly or indirectly funded by the 
Reporting Bank72;  
 
(l)  
the amount paid-up by ordinary shareholders is not secured or covered by 
a guarantee of the Reporting Bank or any of its related corporations or 
other affiliates. In addition, the ordinary share is not subject to any other 
 
71  
To avoid doubt, in cases where capital instruments have a permanent write-down feature, this criterion is 
still deemed to be met by ordinary shares. 
72  
The Reporting Bank does not have to exclude funding to a borrower that purchases the ordinary shares of 
the Reporting Bank from regulatory capital where – 
(a) the Reporting Bank has full recourse to the borrower; and  
(b) the funding was not provided specifically for the purpose of purchasing the ordinary shares of the 
Reporting Bank.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-4 
arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the 
claim;  
 
(m) the ordinary share is issued with the approval of the ordinary 
shareholders. The approval is either given directly by the ordinary 
shareholders or, if permitted by written law, given by the Board of the 
Reporting Bank or by other persons duly authorised by the ordinary 
shareholders; and  
 
(n) 
the ordinary share is clearly and separately disclosed on the Reporting 
Bank’s balance sheet. 
 
6.1.3 
In the case where the Reporting Bank issues non-voting ordinary shares as part 
of CET1 Capital, the non-voting ordinary shares must be identical to the voting ordinary 
shares of the Reporting Bank in all respects, except the absence of voting rights. 
 
6.1.4 
The Reporting Bank must seek prior approval from the Authority if it intends to 
include in CET1 Capital an instrument that has its dividends paid in anything other than 
cash or shares. 
 
 
Regulatory Adjustments Applied in the Calculation of CET1 Capital 
 
6.1.5 
 
A Reporting Bank must apply the following regulatory adjustments in the 
calculation of CET1 Capital, at both the Solo and Group levels: 
 
(a)   the Reporting Bank must deduct goodwill, including any goodwill included 
in the valuation of investments in unconsolidated major stake companies,  
in the calculation of CET1 Capital.73 The Reporting Bank must deduct the 
full amount representing goodwill, net of any associated deferred tax 
liability that would be extinguished if the goodwill becomes impaired or is 
derecognised under the Accounting Standards; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct intangible assets, including but not 
limited to copyright, patents and other intellectual property, in the 
calculation of CET1 Capital. The Reporting Bank must deduct the full 
amount representing intangible assets, net of any associated deferred tax 
liability that would be extinguished if the intangible assets become 
impaired or are derecognised under the Accounting Standards;    
 
(c)   the Reporting Bank must deduct deferred tax assets that rely on the future 
profitability74 of the Reporting Bank or any banking group entity to be 
realised in the calculation of CET1 Capital.75 The Reporting Bank must 
assign, and must ensure that its banking group entity assigns, the relevant 
 
73  
To avoid doubt, goodwill included in the carrying amount of associates accounted for using the equity 
method should be deducted from CET1 Capital at the Group level. Such goodwill should be calculated by 
separating any excess of the acquisition cost over the Reporting Bank’s share of the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of the entity. 
74  
The test to assess whether a deferred tax asset is realisable over a one year period is not applicable. 
75 
Current year tax losses carried back to prior years or an overinstallment of tax may give rise to a claim or 
receivable from the government or relevant tax authority. Such amounts are usually classified as current 
tax assets for accounting purposes. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-5 
sovereign risk weight to a claim or receivable from the government or 
relevant tax authority. To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must deduct any 
deferred tax assets associated with general allowances or TEP, maintained 
by the Reporting Bank in the calculation of CET1 Capital.  
 
At the Solo level, the Reporting Bank may net deferred tax assets with 
associated deferred tax liabilities prior to deducting deferred tax assets in 
the calculation of CET1 Capital, only if offsetting is permitted by the 
relevant tax authority. The Reporting Bank must exclude from deferred 
tax liabilities permitted to be netted against deferred tax assets, amounts 
that have been netted against the deduction of goodwill, intangible assets 
and defined benefit pension assets pursuant to sub-paragraphs (a), (b) 
and (i) respectively of this paragraph.  
 
The Reporting Bank must not permit the following for the purposes of 
calculating CET1 CAR, Tier 1 CAR or Total CAR at the Group level: 
 
(i) 
intra-entity netting of deferred tax assets against deferred tax 
liabilities for any banking group entity incorporated or established 
outside Singapore;  
 
(ii) 
inter-entity netting of deferred tax assets against deferred tax 
liabilities.  
 
However, the Authority may permit sub-paragraphs (c)(i) and (c)(ii) if the 
Reporting Bank confirms in writing to the Authority that the deferred tax 
assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax 
authority, and that it has received written opinions from external auditors 
and legal advisors that the relevant tax authorities allow or would allow, 
deferred tax assets to be offset against the deferred tax liabilities. To avoid 
doubt, the Reporting Bank must exclude from deferred tax liabilities 
permitted to be netted against deferred tax assets, amounts that have 
been netted against the deduction of goodwill, intangible assets and 
defined benefit pension assets pursuant to sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (i) 
respectively of this paragraph;  
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank must derecognise the amount of cash flow hedge 
reserve that relates to the hedging of items that are not fair valued on the 
balance sheet, including projected cash flows, in the calculation of CET1 
Capital. In this regard, positive amounts must be deducted, and negative 
amounts must be added back76;  
 
(e) 
in the case where the Reporting Bank has adopted the IRBA, the Reporting 
Bank must deduct any shortfall of the TEP relative to the total EL amount 
in the calculation of CET1 Capital. The Reporting Bank must deduct the 
full amount of such shortfall of the TEP, and must not reduce the amount 
by any tax effects that could be expected to occur if provisions were to 
rise to the level of total EL amount; 
 
76  
This adjustment specifically identifies and removes the element of the cash flow hedge reserve that gives 
rise to artificial volatility in common equity, as the reserve only reflects the fair value of the derivative, and 
not the change in the fair value of the hedged future cash flow. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-6 
 
(f) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct any increase in equity resulting from a 
securitisation transaction, such as that which is associated with expected 
future margin income resulting in a gain-on-sale, in the calculation of CET1 
Capital; 
 
(g) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct any exposures to credit-enhancing 
interest-only strips, net of – 
 
(i) 
specific allowances attributable to such exposures; and 
 
(ii) 
the amount that must be deducted in the calculation of CET1 Capital 
under sub-paragraph (f) that is attributable to such exposures; 
 
in the calculation of CET1 Capital; 
 
(h) 
the Reporting Bank must derecognise all unrealised fair value gains or 
losses, whether recognised through profit and loss or other comprehensive 
income, on financial liabilities arising from changes in the credit risk of the 
Reporting Bank or any banking group entity in the calculation of CET1 
Capital. In this regard, positive amounts must be deducted, and negative 
amounts must be added back. In addition, all accounting valuation 
adjustments on derivative liabilities arising from changes in the credit risk 
of the Reporting Bank or any banking group entity must be derecognised 
in the calculation of CET1 Capital. The offsetting between valuation 
adjustments arising from changes in the credit risk of the Reporting Bank 
or any banking group entity and those arising from changes in the credit 
risk of the counterparties must not be allowed. In addition, any funding 
valuation adjustment applied by a Reporting Bank or any banking group 
entity must not have the effect of offsetting or reducing its unrealised fair 
value gains or losses on financial liabilities or accounting valuation 
adjustments on derivative liabilities arising from changes in the credit risk 
of the Reporting Bank or any banking group entity, for the purposes of 
calculating the amount to be derecognised in the calculation of CET1 
Capital;  
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank must fully recognise any defined benefit pension fund 
liabilities77, as included in the balance sheet, in the calculation of CET1 
Capital. The creation of the liability on the balance sheet of the bank will 
result in a reduction in the bank’s common equity through a reduction in 
reserves and the Reporting Bank must ensure that no adjustment is 
applied in respect of the calculation of CET1 Capital. For each defined 
benefit pension fund that is an asset on the balance sheet, the Reporting 
Bank must deduct the asset in the calculation of CET1 Capital net of any 
associated deferred tax liabilities which would be extinguished if the asset 
becomes impaired or derecognised under the Accounting Standards. The 
Reporting Bank may, with the prior approval of the Authority, offset the 
 
77  
The liability, as recorded on the balance sheet in respect of a defined benefit pension fund, must be 
recognised in the calculation of CET1 Capital. The creation of the liability on the balance sheet of the bank 
will result in a reduction in the bank’s common equity through a reduction in reserves and no adjustment 
must be applied in respect of the calculation of CET1 Capital.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-7 
deduction of assets in the fund to which the Reporting Bank has 
unrestricted and unfettered access. The Reporting Bank must give such 
offsetting assets the risk weight they would receive as if they were owned 
directly by the Reporting Bank78; 
 
(j)    the Reporting Bank must deduct all investments in the Reporting Bank’s 
own ordinary shares (including treasury shares, where applicable), 
whether held directly or indirectly by the Reporting Bank or any of its 
banking group entities, in the calculation of CET1 Capital, unless already 
derecognised under the Accounting Standards.79 If the Reporting Bank or 
any of its banking group entities is contractually obliged to purchase any 
of its own ordinary shares, the Reporting Bank must deduct such ordinary 
shares in the calculation of CET1 Capital. The Reporting Bank must apply 
this adjustment to exposures in both the banking book and trading 
book.80 Where a Reporting Bank acts as a market-maker for its own 
ordinary shares, it is not required to deduct such capital instruments in 
the calculation of CET1 Capital, until the Reporting Bank has offered to 
purchase the ordinary shares at an agreed price, and this offer has either 
been accepted or cannot be withdrawn.81  
 
 
 
 
Gross long positions may be deducted net of short positions in the same 
underlying exposure, only if the short positions involve no counterparty 
credit risk. The Reporting Bank must look through holdings of index 
securities to deduct exposures to its own ordinary shares. The Reporting 
Bank may, with the prior approval of the Authority, use a conservative 
estimate82. If the Reporting Bank uses a conservative estimate, the 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the methodology for the estimate 
demonstrates that in no case will the actual exposure be higher than the 
estimated exposure. However, the Reporting Bank may net gross long 
positions in its own ordinary shares resulting from holdings of index 
securities against short positions in its own ordinary shares, which result 
 
78 
This adjustment addresses the concern that assets arising from pension funds may not be capable of being 
withdrawn and used for the protection of depositors and other creditors of the Reporting Bank. The concern 
is that their only value stems from a reduction in future payments into the fund. The treatment allows the 
Reporting Bank to reduce the deduction of the assets if it can address these concerns and show that it has 
unrestricted and unfettered access to these assets and the assets can be easily and promptly withdrawn 
from the fund. 
79  
This deduction is to avoid the double counting of the Reporting Bank’s own capital that arises from direct 
holdings, indirect holdings via index funds and potential future holdings as a result of contractual obligations 
to purchase own shares. 
80 
To avoid doubt, this adjustment does not cover ordinary shares held by the Reporting Bank or any of its 
banking group entities where – 
(a) the investments in the ordinary shares are funded by third parties other than the Reporting Bank or 
any of its banking group entities (e.g. life insurance policyholders or other third party investors); 
(b) the risks and rewards associated with the investments in ordinary shares are borne primarily by the 
third parties; and 
(c) decisions to transact in the ordinary shares are made independently from the issuer of the capital 
instruments and in the interests of the third parties. 
81  
The purpose of the rule is to capture existing contractual arrangements that could lead to the Reporting 
Bank being required to make a purchase of its own capital instruments at a price agreed in the contract 
(e.g. a forward purchase or a written put option), such that the extent of the potential loss is known in 
advance. It was not intended to capture all potential contracts that a bank may enter to in the future.

from short positions in the same underlying index83. Despite the 
cancellation of MAS Notice 637 in force immediately before 1 July 2024, 
an approval granted under paragraph 6.1.3(o)(ii)(A) read with footnote 
43 of that Notice, that was in force immediately before 1 July 2024, is 
treated as an approval granted under paragraph 6.1.5(j) of this Notice 
and every condition or restriction which the approval was subject to, that 
was in force immediately before 1 July 2024, will on and after that date 
continue to apply;  
 
(k) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct reciprocal cross holdings84 in the ordinary 
share capital of financial institutions that are designed to artificially inflate 
the capital position of the Reporting Bank in the calculation of CET1 
Capital;  
 
(l) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct PE/VC investments held beyond the 
relevant holding periods set out in MAS Notice 630 in the calculation of 
CET1 Capital, unless otherwise approved by the Authority;  
 
(m) the Reporting Bank must deduct the full amount of capital deficits in 
subsidiaries that are financial institutions and that are subject to minimum 
prudential standards and supervision by a regulatory agency, and the pro 
rata share of capital deficits in associates that are financial institutions and 
that are subject to minimum prudential standards and supervision by a 
regulatory agency, in the calculation of CET1 Capital. In the event that a 
recapitalisation plan is in place or an irrevocable commitment has been 
given by other shareholders to make up the capital deficit, the Authority 
may approve a corresponding reduction in the amount of deductions in 
respect of such capital deficits;  
 
(n) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct valuation adjustments made in 
accordance with Annex 6C that exceed the valuation adjustments made 
under financial reporting standards in the calculation of CET1 Capital;  
 
(o) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct certain investments85 in the ordinary 
shares of unconsolidated financial institutions in which the Reporting Bank 
does not hold a major stake, in the calculation of CET1 Capital, in 
accordance with sub-paragraphs (o)(i) and (o)(ii):  
 
(i) 
the amount of such investments to be deducted in the calculation of 
CET1 Capital must be the proportion of ordinary share holdings to 
total holdings of capital instruments and other TLAC liabilities not 
covered by the 5% threshold described in paragraph 6.3.10(c)(iii) to 
(iv), multiplied by the amount by which total holdings of capital 
instruments and other TLAC liabilities not covered by the 5%

In such cases, the short positions may involve counterparty credit risk, which will be subject to the relevant 
counterparty credit risk charge as set out in Part VII.

threshold described in paragraph 6.3.10(c)(iii) to (iv) in aggregate 
and on a net long basis exceed 10% of the Reporting Bank’s common 
equity. In this sub-paragraph, the Reporting Bank’s common equity 
for the purposes of calculating the 10% threshold must be calculated 
after applying the regulatory adjustments set out in sub-paragraphs 
(a) to (n) to the sum of the elements set out in paragraph 6.1.1(a) 
to (f);  
 
(ii) 
the total holdings of capital instruments and other TLAC liabilities and 
ordinary share holdings referred to in sub-paragraph (o)(i) must be 
calculated as follows: 
  
(A) 
direct, indirect and synthetic holdings of capital instruments 
and other TLAC liabilities must be included. For example, the 
Reporting Bank must look through holdings of index securities 
to determine the underlying holdings of capital and other TLAC 
liabilities. The Reporting Bank may, with the prior approval of 
the Authority, use a conservative estimate.86 If the Reporting 
Bank uses a conservative estimate, the Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the methodology for the estimate demonstrates 
that in no case will the actual exposure be higher than the 
estimated exposure. Despite the cancellation of MAS Notice 
637 in force immediately before 1 July 2024, an approval 
granted under paragraph 6.1.3(o)(ii)(A) read with footnote 43 
of that Notice, that was in force immediately before 1 July 
2024, is treated as an approval granted under paragraph 
6.1.5(o)(ii)(A) of this Notice and every condition or restriction 
which the approval was subject to, that was in force 
immediately before 1 July 2024, will on and after that date 
continue to apply; 
 
(B) 
the net long positions in both the banking book and trading 
book must be included. In this regard, the gross long position 
can be offset against the short position in the same underlying 
exposure, if the maturity of the short position either matches 
the maturity of the long position, or has a residual maturity of 
at least one year87,88,89. For other TLAC liabilities, it is the

If the Reporting Bank finds it operationally burdensome to look through and monitor its exact exposure to 
the capital or other TLAC liabilities of such entities as a result of its holdings of index securities. 
87 
For positions in the trading book, if the Reporting Bank has a contractual right or obligation to sell a long 
equity position at a specific point in time and the counterparty in the contract has an obligation to purchase 
the long equity position if the Reporting Bank exercises its right to sell, this point in time may be treated 
as the maturity of the long position, and the maturity of the long and short positions are deemed to be 
matched. 
88 
For a position hedged against market risk where the hedge does not qualify to offset the gross long position 
for the purposes of determining the amount to be deducted, the Reporting Bank may choose to include the 
long position in its calculation of market RWA, in addition to deducting the long position. Where the hedge 
qualifies to offset the gross long position, the Reporting Bank may choose to exclude both the gross long 
position and the hedge from its calculation of market RWA.  
89 
Where a Reporting Bank uses a short position in an index to hedge a long position, the Reporting Bank 
may, with the prior approval of the Authority, offset the long position with the portion of the index that is 
composed of the same underlying exposure that is being hedged only if (a) both the long position and the 
hedge are held in the trading book; (b) the positions are are accounted for at fair value; and (c) the hedge 
is recognised as effective under the Reporting Bank’s internal control processes.

gross long position that is to be included in paragraph 
6.3.10(c) (iii) to (iv) and the net long position that is to be 
included in paragraph 6.1.5(o)(i) to (ii);  
 
(C) 
underwriting positions in capital instruments or other TLAC 
liabilities held for a period longer than 5 working days must 
be included, while those positions held for 5 working days or 
less can be excluded. The calculation of the period of 5 
working days must begin on the date on which the Reporting 
Bank makes the payment to the issuer to purchase the capital 
instruments; 
 
(D) 
if the capital instrument of the entity in which the Reporting 
Bank has invested does not meet the criteria for CET1 Capital, 
AT1 Capital or Tier 2 Capital of the Reporting Bank, the capital 
instrument is to be considered as ordinary shares for the 
purposes of this regulatory adjustment90; 
 
(E) 
the maximum amount that could be paid out on any guarantee 
or capital enhancement, through which capital support is 
provided by the Reporting Bank to a financial institution must 
be included. The Reporting Bank must consult the Authority if 
there is uncertainty whether such guarantee or capital 
enhancement is to be considered as ordinary shares for the 
purposes of the regulatory adjustment;  
 
(F) 
certain investments where these have been made in the 
context of resolving or providing financial assistance to 
reorganise a distressed institution may be temporarily 
excluded with the approval of the Authority; 
 
(iii) the amount of total holdings of capital instruments and other TLAC 
liabilities not covered by the 5% threshold described in paragraph 
6.3.10(c)(iii) to (iv) that do not exceed the 10% threshold calculated 
in accordance with sub-paragraph (o)(i) and are not deducted must 
continue to be risk-weighted91. For the application of risk-weighting, 
the amount of the holdings must be allocated on a pro rata basis 
between those below and those above the threshold;  
 
90 
To avoid doubt –   
(a) a capital instrument would be deemed to have met the criteria for CET1 Capital, AT1 Capital or Tier 2 
Capital of the Reporting Bank, if it satisfies the applicable regulatory capital criteria imposed by a bank 
regulatory agency that has implemented the Basel III standards;  
(b) if the entity in which the Reporting Bank has invested is a financial institution that is subject to 
minimum prudential standards and supervision by a regulatory agency and the investment is not 
included as regulatory capital of the entity, the investment can be excluded for the purposes of this 
regulatory adjustment; and 
(c) if the entity in which the Reporting Bank has invested is a financial institution that is not a bank, the 
entity is subject to minimum prudential standards and supervision by a regulatory agency and the 
investment is not in the form of ordinary shares but is nevertheless recognised as Tier 1 capital (or its 
equivalent) or Tier 2 capital (or its equivalent) of the entity, the capital instrument should be considered 
as an AT1 capital instrument or Tier 2 capital instrument, respectively, for the purposes of this 
regulatory adjustment. 
91 
Capital instruments in the banking book and trading book will thus be subject to the capital treatment as 
set out in Part VII and Part VIII, respectively.

(p) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct certain investments92 in the ordinary 
shares of unconsolidated financial institutions in which the Reporting Bank 
holds a major stake (including insurance subsidiaries), in the calculation 
of CET1 Capital, in accordance with sub-paragraphs (p)(i) and (p)(ii), 
unless a deduction has been made pursuant to sub-paragraph (l): 
 
(i) 
subject to paragraphs 6.1.6 and 6.1.7, the amount of such 
investments to be deducted in the calculation of CET1 Capital must 
be the amount by which such investments in aggregate exceed the 
threshold amount. In this sub-paragraph, the threshold amount is 
the lower of: 
 
(A) 
10% of the Reporting Bank’s common equity, calculated by 
applying the regulatory adjustments set out in sub-
paragraphs (a) to (o) to the sum of elements set out in 
paragraph 6.1.1(a) to (f);   
 
(B) 
15% of the Reporting Bank’s CET1 Capital93; 
 
(ii) 
the investments in aggregate referred to in sub-paragraph (p)(i) 
must be calculated as follows: 
 
(A) 
direct, indirect and synthetic holdings must be included. The 
Reporting Bank must look through holdings of index securities 
to determine the underlying holdings of ordinary shares. The 
Reporting Bank may, with the prior approval of the Authority, 
use a conservative estimate.94 If the Reporting Bank uses a 
conservative estimate, the Reporting Bank must ensure that 
the methodology for the estimate demonstrates that in no case 
will the actual exposure be higher than the estimated 
exposure; 
 
(B) 
the net long positions in both the banking book and trading 
book must be included. In this regard, the gross long position 
can be offset against the short position in the same underlying 
exposure, if the maturity of the short position either matches

Provision of capital support by way of guarantee or other capital enhancements is treated as capital invested 
in financial institutions, and the quantum of such capital is  the maximum amount that could be required 
to be paid out on any such guarantee.  
93 
This is equivalent to 17.65% of the Reporting Bank’s common equity after (a) applying all regulatory 
adjustments set out in paragraph 6.1.5(a) to (o); and (b) deducting in full such investments described in 
paragraph 6.1.5(p)(ii).

the maturity of the long position or has a residual maturity of 
at least one year95,96,97; 
 
(C) 
underwriting positions held for a period longer than 5 working 
days must be included, while those positions held for 5 
working days or less can be excluded; 
 
(D) 
if the capital instrument of the entity in which the Reporting 
Bank has invested does not meet the criteria for CET1 Capital, 
AT1 Capital or Tier 2 Capital of the Reporting Bank, the capital 
instrument is to be considered as ordinary shares for the 
purposes of this regulatory adjustment98;  
 
(E) 
the maximum amount that could be paid out on any guarantee 
or capital enhancement, through which capital support is 
provided by the Reporting Bank to a financial institution must 
be included. The Reporting Bank must consult the Authority if 
there is uncertainty whether such guarantee or capital 
enhancement is to be considered as ordinary shares for the 
purposes of the regulatory adjustment;  
 
(F) 
certain investments where these have been made in the 
context of resolving or providing financial assistance to 
reorganise a distressed institution may be temporarily 
excluded with the approval of the Authority;  
 
 
95  
For positions in the trading book, if the Reporting Bank has a contractual right or obligation to sell a long 
equity position at a specific point in time and the counterparty in the contract has an obligation to purchase 
the long equity position if the Reporting Bank exercises its right to sell, this point in time may be treated 
as the maturity of the long position, and the maturity of the long and short positions are deemed to be 
matched.   
96  
For a position hedged against market risk where the hedge does not qualify to offset the gross long position 
for the purposes of determining the amount to be deducted, the Reporting Bank may choose to include the 
long position in its calculation of market RWA, in addition to deducting the long position. Where the hedge 
qualifies to offset the gross long position, the Reporting Bank may choose to exclude both the gross long 
position and the hedge from its calculation of market RWA. 
97  
Where a Reporting Bank uses a short position in an index to hedge a long position, the Reporting Bank 
may, with the prior approval of the Authority, offset the long position with the portion of the index that is 
composed of the same underlying exposure that is being hedged only if (a) both the long position and the 
hedge are held in the trading book; (b) the positions are accounted for at fair value; and (c) the hedge is 
recognised as effective under the Reporting Bank’s internal control processes.   
98  
To avoid doubt –  
(a) a capital instrument would be deemed to have met the criteria for CET1 Capital, AT1 Capital or Tier 2 
Capital of the Reporting Bank, if it satisfies the applicable regulatory capital criteria imposed by a bank 
regulatory agency that has implemented the Basel III standards;  
(b) if the entity in which the Reporting Bank has invested is a financial institution that is subject to 
minimum prudential standards and supervision by a regulatory agency and the investment is not 
included as regulatory capital of the entity, the investment can be excluded for the purposes of this 
regulatory adjustment; and 
(c) if the entity in which the Reporting Bank has invested is a financial institution that is not a bank, the 
entity is subject to minimum prudential standards and supervision by a regulatory agency and the 
investment is not in the form of ordinary shares but is nevertheless recognised as Tier 1 capital (or its 
equivalent) or Tier 2 capital (or its equivalent) of the entity, the capital instrument should be considered 
as an AT1 capital instrument or Tier 2 capital instrument, respectively, for the purposes of this 
regulatory adjustment.

(iii) the amounts of such investments that do not exceed the thresholds 
set out in sub-paragraph (p)(i) and are not deducted must be risk-
weighted at 250%;  
 
(q) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct any other item or class of items which 
the Authority may specify in writing to the Reporting Bank for the purposes 
of this paragraph;  
 
(r) 
in the case where the Reporting Bank does not have enough AT1 Capital 
to satisfy the required deductions set out in paragraph 6.2.6, the 
Reporting Bank must deduct the shortfall in the calculation of CET1 
Capital.  
 
6.1.6 
Despite paragraph 6.1.5(p)(i), a Reporting Bank may, in the calculation of CET1 
Capital at the Solo level, risk-weight an investment in the ordinary shares of an 
unconsolidated financial institution in which the Reporting Bank holds a major stake, at 
400%, with the approval of the Authority. 
 
6.1.7 
Where a Reporting Bank risk-weights an investment at 400% in accordance 
with paragraph 6.1.6 (“relevant investment”), the Reporting Bank must apply the 
regulatory adjustments in the calculation of CET1 Capital set out in paragraph 6.1.5(p) as 
follows:  
 
(a)   the Reporting Bank must include the relevant investment when calculating 
the “investments in aggregate” referred to in paragraph 6.1.5(p)(i) and 
(ii), the “threshold amount” referred to in paragraph 6.1.5(p)(i)(B)99 and 
the “threshold” referred to in 6.1.5(p)(iii) (where the threshold amount 
referred to in paragraph 6.1.5(p)(i)(B) is applicable);  
 
 (b)  the Reporting Bank must calculate the amount of investments to be 
deducted in the calculation of CET1 Capital as A−B, where – 
 
 (i) 
A is the amount of investments that the Reporting Bank would have 
deducted in the calculation of CET1 Capital but for paragraph 6.1.6 
and this paragraph; and 
 
 (ii) B is the amount of the relevant investment;  
 
 (c)  the Reporting Bank must risk-weight the amount of investments 
(excluding the relevant investment) that do not exceed the thresholds 
calculated in accordance with paragraph 6.1.5(p)(i) and sub-paragraph 
(a), and that are not deducted, in accordance with paragraph 6.1.5(p)(iii). 
 
6.1.8 
The Authority may grant the approval mentioned in paragraph 6.1.6  subject to 
such conditions or restrictions as the Authority may impose. The Authority will not normally 
grant such approval unless the Reporting Bank is able to demonstrate that such 
 
99  
For example, in determining the threshold amount referred to in paragraph 6.1.5(p)(i)(B) using the formula 
in footnote 93, the Reporting Bank should include the relevant investment as part of the investments to be 
deducted under that formula.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-14 
investments can be realised and made available to the Reporting Bank during stress100, 
and the risk of loss of value in stress is adequately covered by capital required by risk-
weighting such investments at 400%101. Despite the cancellation of MAS Notice 637 in 
force immediately before 1 July 2024, an approval granted under paragraph 6.1.A of that 
Notice, that was in force immediately before 1 July 2024, is treated as an approval granted 
under paragraph 6.1.6 of this Notice and every condition or restriction which the approval 
was subject to, that was in force immediately before 1 July 2024, will on and after that 
date continue to apply. 
 
6.1.9 
For the purposes of paragraph 6.1.5, indirect holdings of capital instruments 
and other TLAC liabilities refer to exposures or parts of exposures that, if a direct holding 
loses its value, will result in a loss to the Reporting Bank substantially equivalent to the 
loss in value of the direct holding. 
 
 
Ordinary Shares Issued by Fully Consolidated Subsidiaries 
 
6.1.10 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the amount of minority interest that will be 
recognised as consolidated CET1 Capital as follows (please refer to Annex 6A for an 
illustrative example): 
 
(a)  CET1 capital that is held by third party investors (“eligible minority 
interest”); less 
 
(b) 
the surplus CET1 Capital of the subsidiary attributable to the minority 
shareholders;  
 
where: 
 
(i) 
eligible minority interest is such minority interest that arises from 
paid-up ordinary shares issued by a fully consolidated subsidiary of 
the Reporting Bank which is a bank (whether licensed or regulated in 
Singapore or outside Singapore)102,103 that if issued by the Reporting 
Bank, would meet all of the criteria for classification as ordinary 
shares for regulatory capital purposes, and includes retained 
earnings and reserves of such a subsidiary that are attributable to 
third party investors; 
 
 
100 
For example, if value of the investment is realised through a disposal of overseas subsidiary, the Reporting 
Bank should present a credible disposal plan, including an intent to dispose the subsidiary in stress and 
demonstrate that there are no impediments to execute the sale. 
101 
For example, this could be assessed by determining the sale value or “threshold price” at which there is no 
negative capital impact on the Reporting Bank’s CET1 CAR levels between pre and post-sale and whether 
the estimated sale value during stress exceeds this threshold price. The Reporting Bank should ensure that 
its valuation should be backed by reasonable assumptions. 
102  For the purposes of this paragraph, any financial institution that is subject to the same minimum prudential 
standards and level of supervision as a bank may be considered to be a bank. 
103  Minority interest in a subsidiary that is itself a bank is strictly excluded from the consolidated CET1 Capital 
if the Reporting Bank or any of its related corporations or other affiliates have entered into any 
arrangements to fund directly or indirectly, minority investment in the subsidiary whether through an SPE 
or through another vehicle or arrangement. The treatment outlined above is thus applicable only where all 
minority investments in that subsidiary represent genuine third party common equity contributions to the 
subsidiary. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-15 
(ii) the surplus CET1 Capital of the subsidiary is calculated as the CET1 
Capital of the subsidiary, minus the lower of: 
 
(A) 
9%104 of the subsidiary’s total RWA; and 
 
(B) 
9%105 of the consolidated RWA attributable to the subsidiary; 
and  
 
(iii) the surplus CET1 Capital of the subsidiary attributable to minority 
shareholders is calculated by multiplying the surplus CET1 Capital of 
the subsidiary calculated in sub-paragraph (b)(ii), by the percentage 
of eligible minority interest. 
 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must not include capital that has been issued to third 
party investors out of an SPE in CET1 Capital.  
 
 
 
 
 
104 
This represents the sum of the minimum CET1 CAR of 6.5% and Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5% that 
is applicable to the banking group. Where the Reporting Bank is not designated by the Authority as a  
D-SIB, the ratios set out in paragraph 62 of “Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient 
banks and banking systems” issued by the BCBS in December 2010 (last revised in June 2011), will apply 
(i.e. 7% of the subsidiary’s total RWA, which represents the sum of the minimum CET1 CAR of 4.5% and 
Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%).

Division 2:  Additional Tier 1 Capital 
 
 
 Components of AT1 Capital 
 
6.2.1 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its AT1 Capital is calculated as the sum of 
the following items, at both the Solo and Group levels:  
 
(a) 
capital instruments issued by the Reporting Bank which comply with the 
requirements in paragraph 6.2.2, and are not included in CET1 Capital;  
 
(b) 
share premium, resulting from the issuance of capital instruments which 
fall within sub-paragraph (a), if any;  
 
(c) 
capital instruments issued by fully consolidated subsidiaries of the 
Reporting Bank and held by third party investors that meet the criteria for 
inclusion in AT1 Capital pursuant to paragraphs 6.2.8 and 6.2.9 , and are 
not included in CET1 Capital;  
 
(d)  regulatory adjustments set out in paragraph 6.2.6.  
 
 
Minimum Requirements for AT1 Capital Instruments  
 
6.2.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 6.2.1(a), a Reporting Bank must not include a 
capital instrument of the Reporting Bank as AT1 Capital unless –  
 
(a) 
the capital instrument is issued and fully paid-up in cash. The Reporting 
Bank must ensure that only the net proceeds received from the issuance 
of the capital instrument may be included as capital; 
 
(b) 
the capital instrument is subordinated to depositors and general creditors 
of the Reporting Bank, and holders of Tier 2 capital instruments issued by 
the Reporting Bank; 
 
(c) 
the paid-up amount is not guaranteed by the Reporting Bank or any of its 
related corporations or other affiliates, or covered under any other 
arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the 
claim vis-a-vis the Reporting Bank’s creditors106; 
 
(d) 
the holder of the capital instrument waives his right, if any, to set off any 
amounts he owes the Reporting Bank against any subordinated amount 
owed to him due to the capital instrument and commits to return any set-
off amounts or benefits received to the liquidator; 
 
(e) 
the subordination provisions of the capital instrument are governed by the 
laws of Singapore and for capital instruments issued on or after 1 January 
2017, the agreements governing the issuance of the capital instruments 
 
106 
For example, where the Reporting Bank issues AT1 capital instruments via an SPE and provides support to 
the SPE (e.g. by contributing a reserve), the provision of support will constitute an enhancement and the 
capital instrument will be regarded as failing to meet this requirement.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-17 
must provide that any dispute arising out of or in connection with the 
provisions governed by the laws of Singapore will be determined 
exclusively by the courts of Singapore. Where the capital instrument is to 
be subject to the laws of a country or jurisdiction other than Singapore, 
the Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that all the relevant conditions 
specified in this paragraph are met under the laws of that country or 
jurisdiction;  
 
(f) 
the capital instrument is perpetual. In this regard, there must be no 
maturity date, and there must be no step-ups or other provisions that 
mandate or create an incentive for the Reporting Bank to redeem the 
capital instrument107. The Reporting Bank must not create an expectation 
that the call option will be exercised;  
 
(g) 
subject to paragraph 6.2.3, the capital instrument is callable at the option 
of the Reporting Bank only after a minimum of 5 years from the issue 
date, subject to the following requirements:  
 
(i) 
a call option may be exercised only with the prior approval of the 
Authority; 
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank must not create an expectation that the call 
option will be exercised108;  
 
(iii) the Reporting Bank must not exercise a call option unless – 
 
(A) 
the capital instrument is replaced by the Reporting Bank with 
capital of the same or better quality, and the replacement of 
this capital is done at conditions which are sustainable for the 
income capacity of the Reporting Bank109; or 
 
(B) 
the Reporting Bank demonstrates that its capital position is 
well above the minimum capital requirements after the call 
option is exercised; 
 
(h) 
any repayment of principal (e.g. through repurchases or redemptions) is 
done only with the prior approval of the Authority. The Reporting Bank 
must not assume or create any expectation that approval will be given by 
 
107 
For example, the following may be considered as an incentive to redeem:  
(a) a call option combined with an increase in the credit spread of the capital instrument if the call option 
is not exercised;  
(b) a call option combined with a requirement or an investor option to convert the capital instrument into 
ordinary shares if the call is not exercised; or 
(c) a call option combined with a change in reference rate where the credit spread over the second 
reference rate is greater than the initial payment rate less the swap rate (i.e. the fixed rate paid to the 
call date to receive the second reference rate).   
 
To avoid doubt, a conversion from a fixed rate to a floating rate or vice versa in combination with a call 
option without any increase in credit spread is not in itself be deemed an incentive to redeem.  
108  
For example, the Authority is not likely to grant approval for redemption where a Reporting Bank calls a 
capital instrument and replaces it with another capital instrument that is more costly (e.g. with a higher 
credit spread). 
109 
Replacement issues can be concurrent with, but not after the capital instrument is called.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-18 
the Authority. Without prejudice to any other matter that the Authority 
may consider relevant, the Authority may in determining whether to grant 
its approval, consider whether the Reporting Bank's capital is likely to 
remain adequate after redemption; 
  
(i)  
with regard to the dividend or coupon payable on the capital instrument – 
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank has full discretion at all times to cancel 
distributions or payments, and the Reporting Bank must ensure that 
its AT1 instruments do not contain dividend pushers 110;  
 
(ii) 
any cancellation of dividend or coupon is not an event of default; 
 
(iii) the Reporting Bank has full access to cancelled payments to meet 
obligations as they fall due; and 
 
(iv) any cancellation of dividend or coupon does not impose restrictions 
on the Reporting Bank111, except in relation to distributions to 
ordinary shareholders; 
 
(j) 
any dividend or coupon to be paid under the capital instrument is only 
paid to the extent that the Reporting Bank has profits distributable under 
written law; 
 
(k) 
the capital instrument does not have a credit sensitive dividend feature, 
i.e. a dividend or coupon that is reset periodically, based in whole or in 
part on the credit standing of the Reporting Bank or any banking group 
entity; 
 
(l) 
the capital instrument does not contribute to liabilities exceeding assets, 
if such a balance sheet test forms part of the law of insolvency;   
 
(m) where the capital instrument is classified as a liability under the 
Accounting Standards, it must have principal loss absorption features 
through –  
 
(i) 
a provision under which it converts to ordinary shares if the CET1 
CAR of the Reporting Bank falls to 7% or below; or  
 
 
110 
A capital instrument with a dividend pusher obliges the Reporting Bank to make a dividend or coupon 
payment on the instrument, if it has made a payment on another (typically more junior) capital instrument 
or share. This obligation is inconsistent with the requirement for the Reporting Bank to have full discretion 
at all times to cancel distributions or payments. Furthermore, the cancellation of distributions or payments 
means that these payments are extinguished without requiring the Reporting Bank to make distributions 
or payments in kind. To avoid doubt, “dividend stoppers” are not prohibited, provided that the Reporting 
Bank retains full discretion at all times to cancel distributions or payments. A capital instrument with a 
dividend stopper stops the Reporting Bank from making a dividend on its ordinary shares or other AT1 
capital instruments if a dividend or coupon payment is not paid on its AT1 capital instruments. 
111 
For example, restrictions which impede the Reporting Bank’s ability to restructure or improve its capital 
position. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-19 
(ii) a write-down mechanism that allocates losses to the capital 
instrument if the CET1 CAR of the Reporting Bank falls to 7% or 
below. The write-down must have the following effects: 
 
(A) 
it reduces the amount claimable by the holder of the capital 
instrument in the liquidation of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(B) 
it reduces the amount to be repaid when a call option is 
exercised;  
 
(C) 
it partially or fully reduces dividend or coupon payments on 
the capital instrument; 
 
 
Under both sub-paragraphs (m)(i) and (m)(ii), the conversion or write-
down must generate CET1 Capital under the Accounting Standards and 
the capital instrument will only receive recognition as AT1 Capital up to 
the minimum level of CET1 generated by a full conversion or write-down 
of the capital instrument. In addition, the aggregate amount to be 
converted or written down for all such capital instruments must be at least 
the amount needed to immediately return the Reporting Bank’s CET1 CAR 
to 7% or, if this is not possible, the full principal value of the capital 
instruments. 
 
Where a Reporting Bank issues the capital instrument in a foreign 
currency, the Reporting Bank must revalue the capital instrument  
periodically (at least monthly) in terms of Singapore dollars at the 
prevailing exchange rates. Where the Reporting Bank intends to use a 
swap to hedge the foreign exchange exposure arising from the foreign 
currency capital instrument, it must consult the Authority on the capital 
treatment applicable to the hedge prior to such use; 
 
(n) 
the Reporting Bank has ensured that – 
 
(i) 
neither the Reporting Bank nor any of its banking group entities or 
associates has purchased the capital instruments; and 
(ii) the Reporting Bank has not directly or indirectly funded the purchase 
of the capital instrument;  
 
(o) 
the capital instrument does not have any feature that hinders 
recapitalisation, such as provisions that require the issuer to compensate 
investors if a new instrument is issued at a lower price during a specified 
time frame. Where there is a dividend stopper within the terms and 
conditions of the AT1 capital instrument, the Reporting Bank must ensure 
that such a feature does not hinder the recapitalisation of the Reporting 
Bank112; 
 
 
112 
For example, a dividend stopper on an AT1 capital instrument must not (a) attempt to stop payment on 
another capital instrument where such payments are not fully discretionary; (b) prevent distributions to 
ordinary shareholders for a period that extends beyond the point in time that dividend or coupon payments 
on the AT1 capital instrument are resumed; or (c) impede the normal operation of the Reporting Bank or 
any restructuring activity such as acquisitions or disposals.  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-20 
(p) 
if the capital instrument is not issued out of an operating entity or the 
holding company of the Reporting Bank (e.g. issued out of a SPE), the 
proceeds from the issuance of the capital instrument must be immediately 
available without limitation to an operating entity or the holding company 
of the Reporting Bank in a form which at the minimum meets all of the 
other requirements set out in this paragraph, for inclusion as AT1 Capital;  
 
(q) 
the main features of the capital instrument are disclosed clearly and 
accurately to the investors of the capital instruments;  
 
(r) 
the agreement governing the issuance of the capital instrument must not 
be changed without the prior approval of the Authority where such 
proposed changes could impact its eligibility as AT1 Capital; and 
 
(s) 
the agreement governing the issuance of the capital instrument contain 
provisions which ensure its loss absorbency at the point of non-viability 
that meet the requirements set out in Annex 6B. 
6.2.3 
The Authority may grant approval for redemption of a capital instrument within 
the first 5 years from the issue date where – 
(a) 
there is a change in tax status of the capital instrument due to changes in 
applicable tax laws of the country or jurisdiction in which the capital 
instrument was issued; or 
(b) 
there is a change relating to the recognition of the capital instrument as 
capital for calculating Tier 1 CAR and Total CAR,  
and provided that the requirements set out in paragraph 6.2.2(g)(i) to (iii) are met. The 
Authority may, in determining whether to grant approval, consider whether the Reporting 
Bank was in a position to anticipate the event at the issuance of the capital instrument. 
 
6.2.4 
For the purposes of paragraph 6.2.1(b), a Reporting Bank must not include any 
share premium that is not eligible for inclusion in CET1 Capital, in AT1 Capital, unless the 
shares giving rise to the share premium comply with the requirements in paragraph 6.2.2. 
 
6.2.5 
The Reporting Bank must seek prior approval from the Authority if it intends to 
include in AT1 Capital an instrument that has its dividends or coupons paid in anything 
other than cash or shares. 
 
 
Regulatory Adjustments Applied in the Calculation of AT1 Capital 
 
6.2.6 
A Reporting Bank must apply the following regulatory adjustments in the 
calculation of AT1 Capital, at both the Solo and Group levels: 
 
 (a) the Reporting Bank must deduct all investments in the Reporting Bank’s 
own AT1 capital instruments, whether held directly or indirectly by the 
Reporting Bank or any of its banking group entities, in the calculation of 
AT1 Capital, unless already derecognised under the Accounting 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-21 
Standards.113 If the Reporting Bank or any of its banking group entities is 
contractually obliged to purchase any of its own AT1 capital instruments, 
the Reporting Bank must deduct such AT1 capital instruments in the 
calculation of AT1 Capital. The Reporting Bank must apply this adjustment  
to exposures in both the banking book and trading book.114 Where a 
Reporting Bank acts as a market-maker for its own AT1 capital 
instruments, it is not required to deduct such capital instruments in the 
calculation of AT1 Capital, until the Reporting Bank has offered to purchase 
the AT1 capital instruments at an agreed price, and this offer has either 
been accepted or cannot be withdrawn.115 
  
 
Gross long positions may be deducted net of short positions in the same 
underlying exposure, only if the short positions involve no counterparty 
credit risk. The Reporting Bank must look through holdings of index 
securities to deduct exposures to its own AT1 capital instruments.116 The 
Reporting Bank may, with the prior approval of the Authority, use a 
conservative estimate.117 If the Reporting Bank uses a conservative 
estimate, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the methodology for the 
estimate demonstrates that in no case will the actual exposure be higher 
than the estimated exposure. However, the Reporting Bank may net gross 
long positions in its own AT1 capital instruments resulting from holdings 
of index securities against short positions in its own AT1 capital 
instruments, which result from short positions in the same underlying 
index118 ; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct reciprocal cross holdings in the AT1 
capital instruments119 of financial institutions that are designed to 
 
113  
This deduction is to avoid the double counting of the Reporting Bank’s own capital that arises from direct 
holdings, indirect holdings via index funds and potential future holdings, as a result of contractual 
obligations to purchase its own AT1 capital instruments. 
114  To avoid doubt, this adjustment does not cover AT1 capital instruments held by the Reporting Bank or any 
of its banking group entities where – 
(a)  the investments in the AT1 capital instruments are funded by third parties other than the Reporting 
Bank or any of its banking group entities (e.g. life insurance policyholders or other third party 
investors); 
(b) the risks and rewards associated with the investments in AT1 capital instruments are borne primarily 
by the third parties; and 
(c) decisions to transact in the AT1 capital instruments are made independently from the issuer of the 
capital instruments and in the interests of the third parties. 
115    The purpose of the rule is to capture existing contractual arrangements that could lead to the Reporting 
Bank being required to make a purchase of its own capital instruments at a price agreed in the contract 
(e.g. a forward purchase or a written put option), such that the extent of the potential loss is known in 
advance. It was not intended to capture all potential contracts that a bank may enter to in the future. 
116  
For both investments in own shares and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions that result 
from holdings of index securities, a Reporting Bank is permitted to net gross long positions against short 
positions in the same underlying index as long as the maturity of the short position matches the maturity 
of the long position or has a residual maturity of at least one year. 
117  
If the Reporting Bank finds it operationally burdensome to look through and monitor its exact exposure to 
its own capital as a result of its holdings in index securities. 
118  
In such cases, the short positions may counterparty credit risk, and be subject to the relevant counterparty 
credit risk charge as set out in Part VII. 
119 
To avoid doubt –   
(a) a capital instrument would be deemed to have met the criteria for AT1 Capital of the Reporting Bank, 
if it satisfies the applicable regulatory capital criteria imposed by a bank regulatory agency that has 
implemented the Basel III standards; and 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-22 
artificially inflate the capital position of the Reporting Bank in the 
calculation of AT1 Capital; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct certain investments in the AT1 capital 
instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions in which the Reporting 
Bank does not hold a major stake, in the calculation of AT1 Capital120, in 
accordance with sub-paragraphs (c)(i) and (c)(ii): 
 
(i) 
the amount of such investments to be deducted in the calculation of 
AT1 Capital must be the proportion of AT1 capital instrument 
holdings to total holdings of capital instruments and other TLAC 
liabilities not covered by the 5% threshold described in paragraph  
6.3.10(c)(iii) to (iv), multiplied by the amount by which total 
holdings of capital instruments and other TLAC liabilities not covered 
by the 5% threshold described in paragraph 6.3.10(c)(iii) to (iv) in 
aggregate and on a net long basis exceed 10% of the Reporting 
Bank’s common equity. In this sub-paragraph, the Reporting Bank’s 
common equity for the purposes of calculating the 10% threshold 
must be calculated in accordance with paragraph 6.1.5(o)(i) and the 
AT1 capital instrument holdings must be calculated as follows: 
 
(A) 
direct, indirect and synthetic holdings of capital instruments 
must be included. The Reporting Bank must look through 
holdings of index securities to determine the underlying 
holdings of capital. The Reporting Bank may, with the prior 
approval of the Authority, use a conservative estimate121. If 
the Reporting Bank uses a conservative estimate, the 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the methodology for the 
estimate demonstrates that in no case will the actual exposure 
be higher than the estimated exposure. Despite the 
cancellation of MAS Notice 637 in force immediately before 1 
July 
2024, 
an

entity is subject to minimum prudential standards and supervision by a regulatory agency and the 
investment is not in the form of ordinary shares but is nevertheless recognised as Tier 1 capital (or its 
equivalent) of the entity, the capital instrument must be considered as an AT1 capital instrument for 
the purposes of this regulatory adjustment. 
120 
To avoid doubt –   
(a) a capital instrument would be deemed to have met the criteria for AT1 Capital of the Reporting Bank, 
if it satisfies the applicable regulatory capital criteria imposed by a bank regulatory agency that has 
implemented the Basel III standards; 
(b) if the entity in which the Reporting Bank has invested is a financial institution that is subject to 
minimum prudential standards and supervision by a regulatory agency and the investment is not 
included as regulatory capital of the entity, the investment can be excluded for the purposes of this 
regulatory adjustment; and  
(c) if the entity in which the Reporting Bank has invested is a financial institution that is not a bank, the 
entity is subject to minimum prudential standards and supervision by a regulatory agency and the 
investment is not in the form of ordinary shares but is nevertheless recognised as Tier 1 capital (or its

and every condition or restriction which the approval was 
subject to, that was in force immediately before 1 July 2024,

(B) 
the net long positions in both the banking book and trading 
book must be included. In this regard, the gross long position 
can be offset against the short position in the same underlying 
exposure, if the maturity of the short position either matches 
the maturity of the long position, or has a residual maturity of 
at least one year122,123,124;  
 
(C) 
underwriting positions held for a period longer than 5 working 
days must be included, while those positions held for 5 
working days or less can be excluded. The calculation of the 
period of 5 working days must begin on the date on which the 
Reporting Bank makes the payment to the issuer to purchase 
the capital instruments;  
 
(D) 
certain investments where these have been made in the 
context of resolving or providing financial assistance to 
reorganise a distressed institution may be temporarily 
excluded with the prior approval of the Authority;  
 
(ii) 
the total holdings of capital instruments and other TLAC liabilities 
referred to in sub-paragraph (c)(i) must be calculated in accordance 
with paragraph 6.1.5(o)(ii);  
 
(iii) the amount of total holdings of capital instruments and other TLAC 
liabilities not covered by the 5% threshold described in paragraph 
6.3.10(c)(iii) to (iv) that do not exceed the 10% threshold calculated 
in accordance with paragraph 6.1.5(o)(i) and are not deducted must 
continue to be risk-weighted125. For the application of risk-weighting, 
the amount of the holdings must be allocated on a pro rata basis 
between those below and those above the threshold;

the Reporting Bank must deduct investments in the AT1 capital 
instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions in which the Reporting

For positions in the trading book, if the Reporting Bank has a contractual right or obligation to sell a long 
equity position at a specific point in time and the counterparty in the contract has an obligation to purchase 
the long equity position if the Reporting Bank exercises its right to sell, this point in time may be treated 
as the maturity of the long position, and the maturity of the long and short positions are deemed to be 
matched. 
123 
For a position hedged against market risk where the hedge does not qualify to offset the gross long position 
for the purposes of determining the amount to be deducted, the Reporting Bank may choose to include the 
long position in its calculation of market RWA, in addition to deducting the long position. Where the hedge 
qualifies to offset the gross long position, the Reporting Bank may choose to exclude both the gross long 
position and the hedge from its calculation of market RWA.  
124 
Where a Reporting Bank uses a short position in an index to hedge a long position, the portion of the index 
that is composed of the same underlying exposure that is being hedged may be used to offset the long 
position only if (a) both positions are held in the trading book; (b) the positions are accounted for at fair 
value; and (c) the hedge is recognised as effective under the Reporting Bank’s internal control processes.

Capital instruments in the banking book and trading book will thus be subject to the capital treatment as 
set out in Part VII and Part VIII, respectively.

Bank holds a major stake (including insurance subsidiaries), in the 
calculation of AT1 Capital126. The total of such investments must be 
calculated as follows: 
 
(i) 
direct, indirect and synthetic holdings must be included. The 
Reporting Bank must look through holdings of index securities to 
determine the underlying holdings of AT1 capital instruments. The 
Reporting Bank may, with the prior approval of the Authority, use a 
conservative estimate.127 If the Reporting Bank uses a conservative 
estimate, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the methodology for 
the estimate demonstrates that in no case will the actual exposure 
be higher than the estimated exposure; 
 
(ii) the net long positions in both the banking book and trading book 
must be included. In this regard, the gross long position can be offset 
against the short position in the same underlying exposure, if the 
maturity of the short position either matches the maturity of the long 
position or has a residual maturity of at least one year128,129,130; 
 
(iii) underwriting positions held for a period longer than 5 working days 
must be included, while those positions held for 5 working days or 
less can be excluded. The calculation of the period of 5 working days 
must begin on the date on which the Reporting Bank makes the 
payment to the issuer to purchase the capital instruments;   
 
 
126 
To avoid doubt –   
(a) a capital instrument would be deemed to have met the criteria for AT1 Capital of the Reporting Bank, 
if it satisfies the applicable regulatory capital criteria imposed by a bank regulatory agency that has 
implemented the Basel III standards;  
(b) if the entity in which the Reporting Bank has invested is a financial institution that is subject to 
minimum prudential standards and supervision by a regulatory agency and if the investment is not 
included as regulatory capital of the entity, the investment can be excluded for the purposes of this 
regulatory adjustment; and 
(c) if the entity in which the Reporting Bank has invested is a financial institution that is not a bank, the 
entity is subject to minimum prudential standards and supervision by a regulatory agency and the 
investment is not in the form of ordinary shares but is nevertheless recognised as Tier 1 capital (or its 
equivalent) of the entity, the capital instrument should be considered as an AT1 capital instrument for 
the purposes of this regulatory adjustment. 
127  
If the Reporting Bank finds it operationally burdensome to look through and monitor its exact exposure to 
the capital or other TLAC liabilities of such entities as a result of its holdings of index securities. 
128  
For positions in the trading book, if the Reporting Bank has a contractual right or obligation to sell a long 
equity position at a specific point in time and the counterparty in the contract has an obligation to purchase 
the long equity position if the Reporting Bank exercises its right to sell, this point in time may be treated 
as the maturity of the long position, and the maturity of the long and short positions are deemed to be

For a position hedged against market risk where the hedge does not qualify to offset the gross long position 
for the purposes of determining the amount to be deducted, the Reporting Bank may choose to include the 
long position in its calculation of market RWA, in addition to deducting the long position. Where the hedge 
qualifies to offset the gross long position, the Reporting Bank may choose to exclude both the gross long 
position and the hedge from its calculation of market RWA.

(iv) certain investments where these have been made in the context of 
resolving or providing financial assistance to reorganise a distressed 
institution may be temporarily excluded with the approval of the 
Authority;  
 
(e) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct any other item or class of items which 
the Authority may specify in writing to the Reporting Bank for the purposes 
of this paragraph;  
 
(f) 
in the case where the Reporting Bank does not have enough Tier 2 Capital 
to satisfy the required deductions set out in paragraph 6.3.10, the 
Reporting Bank must deduct the shortfall  in the calculation of AT1 Capital.  
 
6.2.7 
For the purposes of paragraph 6.2.6, indirect holdings of capital instruments 
and other TLAC liabilities refer to exposures or parts of exposures that, if a direct holding 
loses its value, will result in a loss to the Reporting Bank substantially equivalent to the 
loss in value of the direct holding. 
 
 
 Qualifying Capital Instruments Issued by Fully Consolidated Subsidiaries 
Recognised as Tier 1 Capital  
 
6.2.8  
A Reporting Bank may recognise CET1 capital instruments and AT1 capital 
instruments issued by a fully consolidated subsidiary of a Reporting Bank to third party 
investors (including amounts under paragraph 6.1.10) as Tier 1 Capital only if the capital 
instruments would, if issued by the Reporting Bank, meet all of the criteria for classification 
as Tier 1 Capital131. The Reporting Bank must calculate the amount that will be recognised 
as Tier 1 Capital as follows (please refer to Annex 6A for an illustrative example):  
(a) 
Tier 1 capital of the subsidiary issued to third party investors; less 
 
(b) 
the surplus Tier 1 Capital of the subsidiary attributable to third party 
investors;  
 
where – 
  
(i) 
Tier 1 capital of the subsidiary issued to third party investors means 
the sum of eligible minority interest and AT1 capital instruments 
issued by the subsidiary which are owned by third party investors; 
 
(ii) 
the surplus Tier 1 Capital of the subsidiary is calculated as the Tier 1 
Capital of the subsidiary, minus the lower of – 
 
(A)  
10.5%132 of the subsidiary’s total RWA; and 
 
131 
CET1 capital instruments and AT1 capital instruments should meet all of the criteria for classification as 
CET1 capital instruments and AT1 capital instruments, respectively. 
132 
This represents the sum of the minimum Tier 1 CAR of 8% and Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5% that is 
applicable to the banking group. Where the Reporting Bank is not designated by the Authority as a D-SIB, 
the ratios set out in paragraph 63 of “Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and 
banking systems” issued by the BCBS in December 2010 (last revised in June 2011), will apply  
(i.e. 8.5% of the subsidiary’s total RWA, which represents the sum of the minimum Tier 1 CAR of 6% and 
Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%). 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-26 
 
(B) 
10.5%133 of the consolidated RWA attributable to the 
subsidiary; and 
 
(iii) the surplus Tier 1 Capital of the subsidiary attributable to third party 
investors is calculated by multiplying the surplus Tier 1 Capital of the 
subsidiary calculated in sub-paragraph (b)(ii), by the percentage of 
Tier 1 capital that is held by third party investors. 
 
A Reporting Bank, when recognising the amount of Tier 1 Capital calculated in this 
paragraph as AT1 Capital, must exclude amounts recognised as CET1 Capital under 
paragraph 6.1.10.  
 
6.2.9  
Where capital instruments purchased by third party investors are issued for and 
on behalf of a Reporting Bank out of an SPE, the Reporting Bank may include such capital 
instruments in its AT1 Capital and treat such capital instruments as if the Reporting Bank 
itself had issued the capital instruments directly to the third party investors, only if the 
capital instruments meet all the relevant entry criteria and the only asset of the SPE is its 
investment in the capital instruments of the Reporting Bank in a form that meets or 
exceeds all the relevant entry criteria134 (as required by the criterion set out in paragraph 
6.2.2(p) for AT1 Capital). In cases where the capital instruments have been issued to third 
party investors through an SPE by a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Reporting Bank, 
the Reporting Bank may, subject to the requirements of this paragraph in relation to capital 
instruments issued through an SPE, treat such capital instruments as if the subsidiary itself 
had issued the capital instruments directly to third party investors and may include such 
capital instruments in the Reporting Bank’s consolidated AT1 Capital in accordance with 
the treatment outlined in paragraph 6.2.8. 
 
 
 
 
 
133  This represents the sum of the minimum Tier 1 CAR of 8% and Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5% that is 
applicable to the banking group. Where the Reporting Bank is not designated by the Authority as a D-SIB, 
the ratios set out in paragraph 63 of “Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and 
banking systems” issued by the BCBS in December 2010 (last revised in June 2011), will apply (i.e. 8.5% 
of the consolidated RWA attributable to the subsidiary, which represents the sum of the minimum Tier 1 
CAR of 6% and Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%). 
134 
Assets that relate to the operation of the SPE may be excluded from this assessment if they are de minimis.

Division 3:  Tier 2 Capital 
 
 
Components of Tier 2 Capital 
 
6.3.1 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its Tier 2 Capital is calculated as the sum of 
the following items, at both the Solo and Group levels:   
 
(a) 
capital instruments issued by the Reporting Bank that comply with the 
requirements in paragraph 6.3.6, and are not included in Tier 1 Capital; 
 
(b) 
share premium, resulting from the issuance of capital instruments which 
fall within sub-paragraph (a), if any;  
 
(c) 
capital instruments issued by fully consolidated subsidiaries of the 
Reporting Bank and held by third party investors that meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Tier 2 Capital pursuant to paragraphs 6.3.12 and 6.3.13, and 
are not included in Tier 1 Capital;  
 
(d) 
subject to paragraph 6.3.3, in the case where the Reporting Bank has 
adopted the SA(CR), SEC-ERBA, SEC-SA, or the approach for 
securitisation exposures to which the SEC-IRBA, SEC-ERBA, SEC-IAA and 
SEC-SA cannot be applied, general allowances that are held against 
future, presently unidentified losses, and that are freely available to meet 
losses which subsequently materialise.  The Reporting Bank must exclude 
allowances ascribed to the identified deterioration of particular assets or 
known liabilities, whether individual or grouped. The Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the general allowances eligible for inclusion, measured gross 
of tax effects, do not exceed 1.25% of the sum of the Reporting Bank’s (i) 
SA(CR) RWA determined in the manner set out in paragraph 7.1.1(a), (ii) 
CCR-SA RWA determined in the manner set out in paragraph 7.1.1(b), (iii) 
SEC-ERBA RWA, SEC-SA RWA, and RWA from securitisation exposures to 
which the SEC-IRBA, SEC-ERBA, SEC-IAA and SEC-SA cannot be applied, 
determined in the manner set out in paragraph 7.1.1(d), and (iv) CCP 
RWA determined in the manner set out in paragraph 7.1.1(e); 
 
(e) 
subject to paragraph 6.3.3, in the case where the Reporting Bank has 
adopted the IRBA, any excess of the TEP, measured gross of tax effects,  
maintained by the Reporting Bank over the total EL amount. The Reporting 
Bank must ensure that the amount eligible for inclusion does not exceed 
0.6% of the sum of the Reporting Bank’s (i)  IRBA RWA determined in the 
manner set out in paragraph 7.1.1(a), (ii) CCR-IRBA RWA determined in 
the manner set out in paragraph 7.1.1(b), and (iii) SEC-IRBA and SEC-
IAA RWA determined in the manner set out in paragraph 7.1.1(d);  
 
(f)  regulatory adjustments set out in paragraph 6.3.10. 
 
6.3.2 
 For the purposes of paragraph 6.3.1(e), where the Authority is not satisfied 
that the total EL amount fully reflects the conditions in the market in which the Reporting 
Bank operates, the Authority may require that a Reporting Bank exclude from Tier 2 Capital 
the excess amount of the TEP, measured gross of tax effects, maintained by the Reporting

6-28 
Bank over the total EL amount, including any excess of specific allowances over the EL 
amount on defaulted assets to offset the EL amount on non-defaulted assets.  
 
6.3.3 
A Reporting Bank must apply paragraphs 6.3.4 and 6.3.5 where it has adopted 
(a) the SA(CR), SEC-ERBA, SEC-SA, or the approach for securitisation exposures to which 
the SEC-IRBA, SEC-ERBA, SEC-IAA and SEC-SA cannot be applied for a portion of its credit 
exposures, and (b) the IRBA, SEC-IRBA, or SEC-IAA for the remaining portion of its credit 
exposures. 
 
6.3.4 
For the purposes of determining the inclusion of general allowances in Tier 2 
Capital under paragraph 6.3.1(d), a Reporting Bank referred to in paragraph 6.3.3 must 
pro-rate the general allowances it maintains using the following formula: 
 
 
 
 
 
the sum of the Reporting Bank’s SA(CR) 
RWA determined in the manner set out in 
paragraph 7.1.1(a), its CCR-SA RWA 
determined in the manner set out in 
paragraph 7.1.1(b), its SEC-ERBA RWA, 
SEC-SA RWA,  RWA from securitisation 
exposures to which the SEC-IRBA, SEC-
ERBA, SEC-IAA and SEC-SA cannot be 
applied, determined in the manner set 
out in paragraph 7.1.1(d), and its CCP

Alternatively, subject to the prior approval of the Authority and such conditions as the 
Authority may impose, the Reporting Bank may rely on its internal models for allocating

Minimum Requirements for Tier 2 Capital Instruments 
 
6.3.6  
For the purposes of paragraph 6.3.1(a), a Reporting Bank must not include a 
capital instrument of the Reporting Bank as Tier 2 Capital unless – 
  
(a) 
the capital instrument is issued and fully paid-up in cash. The Reporting 
Bank must ensure that only the net proceeds received from the issuance 
of the capital instrument may be included as capital; 
 
(b) 
the capital instrument is subordinated to depositors and general creditors 
of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(c) 
the paid-up amount is not guaranteed by the Reporting Bank or any of its 
related corporations or other affiliates, or covered under any other 
arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the 
claim vis-a-vis the Reporting Bank’s creditors and depositors135; 
 
(d) 
the holder of the capital instrument waives his right, if any, to set off any 
amounts he owes the Reporting Bank against any subordinated amount 
owed to him due to the capital instrument and commits to return any set-
off amounts or benefits received to the liquidator; 
 
(e) 
the subordination provisions of the capital instrument are governed by the 
laws of Singapore and for capital instruments issued on or after 1 January 
2017, the agreements governing the issuance of the capital instruments 
must provide that any dispute arising out of or in connection with the 
provisions governed by the laws of Singapore will be determined 
exclusively by the courts of Singapore. Where the capital instrument is to 
be subject to the laws of a country or jurisdiction other than Singapore, 
the Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that all the relevant conditions 
specified in this paragraph are met under the laws of that country or 
jurisdiction; 
 
 (f) with regard to the maturity of the capital instrument –  
 
(i) 
the capital instrument has a minimum original maturity of at least 5 
years. Where the agreement governing the issuance of the capital 
instrument provides for the loan to be drawn down in a series of 
tranches, the minimum original maturity for each tranche must be 5 
years from the date of its draw-down; 
 
 
135  
For example, where the Reporting Bank issues Tier 2 capital instruments via an SPE and provides support 
to the SPE (e.g. by contributing a reserve), the provision of support will constitute an enhancement and 
the capital instrument will be regarded as failing to meet this requirement. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-30 
(ii) recognition of the capital instrument as Tier 2 Capital in its final 5 
years to maturity is amortised on a straight-line basis by 20% per 
annum in accordance with Table 6-1. Where the capital instrument is 
repayable in separate tranches, each tranche must be amortised 
individually, as if it were a separate loan; and

(iii) there are no step-ups or other provisions that mandate or create an 
incentive for the Reporting Bank to redeem the capital instrument136. 
The Reporting Bank must not create an expectation that the call 
option will be exercised; 
 
 (g) subject to paragraph 6.3.7, the capital instrument is callable at the option 
of the Reporting Bank only after a minimum of 5 years from the issue 
date, subject to the following requirements:  
 
(i) 
a call option may be exercised only with the prior approval of the 
Authority; 
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank must not create an expectation that the call 
option will be exercised137,138;  
 
(iii) the Reporting Bank must not exercise a call option unless – 
 
(A) 
the capital instrument is replaced by the Reporting Bank with 
capital of the same or better quality, and the replacement of 
 
136  
For example, the following may be considered as an incentive to redeem:  
(a) a call option combined with an increase in the credit spread of the capital instrument if the call option 
is not exercised;  
(b) a call option combined with a requirement or an investor option to convert the capital instrument into 
ordinary shares if the call is not exercised; or 
(c) a call option combined with a change in reference rate where the credit spread over the second 
reference rate is greater than the initial payment rate less the swap rate (i.e. the fixed rate paid to the 
call date to receive the second reference rate).  
 
To avoid doubt, a conversion from a fixed rate to a floating rate or vice versa in combination with a call 
option without any increase in credit spread is not in itself be deemed an incentive to redeem. 
137  
Where this requirement is met, an option to call the capital instrument after 5 years but prior to the start 
of the amortisation period will not be deemed an incentive to redeem. 
138  
For example, the Authority is not likely to grant approval for redemption where a Reporting Bank exercises 
a call option in respect of a capital instrument and replaces it with another capital instrument that is more 
costly (e.g. with a higher credit spread). 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-31 
this capital is done at conditions which are sustainable for the 
income capacity of the Reporting Bank139; or 
 
(B) 
the Reporting Bank demonstrates that its capital position is 
well above the minimum capital requirements after the call 
option is exercised; 
 
(h) 
the holder of the capital instrument has no rights to accelerate the 
repayment of future scheduled payments (either coupon or principal), 
except in a bankruptcy or liquidation of the Reporting Bank;  
 
(i) 
the capital instrument does not have a credit sensitive dividend feature, 
i.e. a dividend or coupon that is reset periodically, based in whole or in 
part on the credit standing of the Reporting Bank or any banking group 
entity; 
 
(j) 
neither the Reporting Bank nor any of its banking group entities or 
associates may purchase the capital instrument, nor can the Reporting 
Bank have directly or indirectly funded the purchase of the capital 
instrument;  
 
(k) 
if the capital instrument is not issued out of an operating entity or the 
holding company of the Reporting Bank (e.g. issued out of a SPE), the 
proceeds from the issuance of the capital instrument must be immediately 
available without limitation to an operating entity or the holding company 
of the Reporting Bank in a form which at the minimum meets all of the 
other requirements set out in this paragraph, for inclusion as Tier 2 
Capital;  
 
(l) 
the main features of the capital instrument are disclosed clearly and 
accurately to the investors of the capital instruments;  
 
(m) the agreement governing the issuance of the capital instrument must not 
be changed without the prior approval of the Authority where such 
proposed changes could impact its eligibility as Tier 2 Capital; 
 
(n) 
where a Reporting Bank issues the capital instrument in a foreign 
currency, the capital instrument must be revalued periodically (at least 
monthly) in terms of Singapore dollars at the prevailing exchange rates.  
Where the Reporting Bank intends to use a swap to hedge the foreign 
exchange exposure arising from the foreign currency capital instrument, 
it must consult the Authority on the capital treatment applicable to the 
hedge prior to such use; and  
 
(o) 
the agreement governing the issuance of the capital instrument contain 
provisions which ensure its loss absorbency at the point of non-viability 
that meet the requirements set out in Annex 6B. 
 
139  
Replacement issues can be concurrent with, but not after the capital instrument is called. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-32 
6.3.7 
The Authority may grant approval for redemption of a capital instrument within 
the first 5 years from the issue date where – 
(a) 
there is a change in tax status of the capital instrument due to changes in 
applicable tax laws of the country or jurisdiction in which the capital 
instrument was issued; or 
(b) 
there is a change relating to the recognition of the capital instrument as 
capital for calculating Total CAR,  
and provided that the requirements set out in paragraph 6.3.6(g)(i) to (iii) are met. The 
Authority may, in determining whether to grant approval, consider whether the Reporting 
Bank was in a position to anticipate the event at the issuance of the capital instrument. 
 
6.3.8 
For the purposes of paragraph 6.3.1(b), a Reporting Bank must not include any 
share premium that is not eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 Capital, in Tier 2 Capital, unless 
the shares giving rise to the share premium comply with the requirements in paragraph 
6.3.6. 
 
6.3.9  
The Reporting Bank must seek prior approval from the Authority if it intends to 
include in Tier 2 Capital an instrument that has its coupons paid in anything other than 
cash or shares. 
 
 
Regulatory Adjustments Applied in the Calculation of Tier 2 Capital 
 
6.3.10 
A Reporting Bank must apply the following regulatory adjustments in the 
calculation of Tier 2 Capital, at both the Solo and Group levels: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct all investments in the Reporting Bank’s 
own Tier 2 capital instruments, whether held directly or indirectly by the 
Reporting Bank or any of its banking group entities, in the calculation of 
Tier 2 Capital, unless already derecognised under the Accounting 
Standards.140 If the Reporting Bank or any of its banking group entities is 
contractually obliged to purchase any of its own Tier 2 capital instruments, 
the Reporting Bank must deduct such Tier 2 capital instruments in the 
calculation of Tier 2 Capital. This adjustment must apply to exposures in 
both the banking book and trading book.141 Where a Reporting Bank acts 
as a market-maker for its own Tier 2 capital instruments, it is not required 
to deduct such capital instruments in the calculation of Tier 2 Capital, until 
the Reporting Bank has offered to purchase the ordinary shares at an 
 
140  
This deduction is to avoid the double counting of the Reporting Bank’s own capital that arises from direct 
holdings, indirect holdings via index funds and potential future holdings as a result of contractual obligations 
to purchase its own Tier 2 capital instruments. 
141  To avoid doubt, this adjustment does not cover Tier 2 capital instruments held by the Reporting Bank or 
any of its banking group entities where – 
(a)  the investments in the Tier 2 capital instruments are funded by third parties other than the Reporting 
Bank or any of its banking group entities (e.g. life insurance policyholders or other third party 
investors); 
(b) the risks and rewards associated with the investments in Tier 2 capital instruments are borne primarily 
by the third parties; and 
(c) the decisions to transact in the Tier 2 capital instruments are made independently from the issuer of 
the capital instruments and in the interests of the third parties.

agreed price, and this offer has either been accepted or cannot be 
withdrawn;142 
  
 The Reporting Bank may deduct gross long positions net of short positions 
in the same underlying exposure, only if the short positions involve no 
counterparty credit risk. The Reporting Bank must look through holdings 
of index securities to deduct exposures to its own Tier 2 capital 
instruments. The Reporting Bank may, with the prior approval of the 
Authority, use a conservative estimate.143 If the Reporting Bank uses a 
conservative estimate, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the 
methodology for the estimate demonstrates that in no case will the actual 
exposure be higher than the estimated exposure. However, the Reporting 
Bank may net gross long positions in its own Tier 2 capital instruments 
resulting from holdings of index securities against short positions in its 
own Tier 2 capital instruments, which result from short positions in the 
same underlying index144;  
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct reciprocal cross holdings in the Tier 2 
capital instruments145 and of other TLAC liabilities of financial institutions 
that are designed to artificially inflate the capital position of the Reporting 
Bank in the calculation of Tier 2 Capital; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct certain investments in Tier 2 capital 
instruments and other TLAC liabilities of unconsolidated financial 
institutions in which the Reporting Bank does not hold a major stake, in 
the calculation of Tier 2 Capital146, in accordance with sub-paragraphs 
(c)(i) to (c)(iv):  
 
142  
The purpose of the rule is to capture existing contractual arrangements that could lead to the Reporting 
Bank being required to make a purchase of its own capital instruments at a price agreed in the contract 
(e.g. a forward purchase or a written put option), such that the extent of the potential loss is known in 
advance. It was not intended to capture all potential contracts that a bank may enter to in the future. 
143  
If the Reporting Bank finds it operationally burdensome to look through and monitor its exact exposure to 
its own capital as a result of its holdings of index securities. 
144  
In such cases, the short positions may be exposed to counterparty credit risk, and be subject to the relevant 
counterparty credit risk charge as set out in Part VII. 
145 
To avoid doubt –   
(a) a capital instrument would be deemed to have met the criteria for Tier 2 Capital of the Reporting Bank, 
if it satisfies the applicable regulatory capital criteria imposed by a bank regulatory agency that has 
implemented the Basel III standards; and 
(b) if the entity in which the Reporting Bank has invested is a financial institution that is not a bank, the 
entity is subject to minimum prudential standards and supervision by a regulatory agency and the 
investment is not in the form of ordinary shares and is recognised as Tier 2 capital (or its equivalent) 
of the entity, the capital instrument should be considered as a Tier 2 capital instrument for the purposes 
of this regulatory adjustment.

regulatory adjustment; and

(i) 
the amount of such investments to be deducted in the calculation of 
Tier 2 Capital must be the proportion of total holdings of Tier 2 capital 
instruments and other TLAC liabilities not covered by the 5% 
threshold described in paragraph 6.3.10(c)(iii) to (iv) to total 
holdings of capital instruments and other TLAC liabilities not covered 
by the 5% threshold described in paragraph 6.3.10(c)(iii) to (iv), 
multiplied by the amount by which total holdings of capital 
instruments and other TLAC liabilities not covered by the 5% 
threshold described in paragraph 6.3.10(c)(iii) to (iv) in aggregate 
and on a net long basis exceed 10% of the Reporting Bank’s common 
equity. In this sub-paragraph, the Reporting Bank’s common equity 
for the purposes of calculating the 10% threshold must be calculated 
in accordance with paragraph 6.1.5(o)(i) and the total holdings of 
Tier 2 capital instruments and other TLAC liabilities must be 
calculated as follows: 
 
(A) 
direct, indirect and synthetic holdings of capital instruments 
and other TLAC liabilities must be included. The Reporting 
Bank must look through holdings of index securities to 
determine the underlying holdings of capital and other TLAC 
liabilities. The Reporting Bank may, with the prior approval of 
the Authority, use a conservative estimate147. If the Reporting 
Bank uses a conservative estimate, the methodology for the 
estimate demonstrates that in no case will the actual exposure 
be higher than the estimated exposure. Despite the

an 
approval 
granted 
under 
paragraph

Notice and every condition or restriction which the approval 
was subject to, that was in force immediately before 1 July 
2024, will on and after that date continue to apply; 
 
(B) 
the net long positions in both the banking book and trading 
book must be included. In this regard, the gross long position 
can be offset against the short position in the same underlying 
exposure, if the maturity of the short position either matches 
the maturity of the long position, or has a residual maturity of 
 
of the entity, the capital instrument should be considered as a Tier 2 capital instrument for the purposes 
of this regulatory adjustment.

included in paragraph 6.3.10(c)(i) to (ii);  
 
(C) 
underwriting positions held for a period longer than 5 working 
days must be included, while those positions held for 5 
working days or less can be excluded. The calculation of the 
period of 5 working days must begin on the date on which the 
Reporting Bank makes the payment to the issuer to purchase 
the capital instruments;  
 
(D) 
certain investments where these have been made in the 
context of resolving or providing financial assistance to 
reorganise a distressed institution may be temporarily 
excluded with the approval of the Authority;  
 
(ii)  the total holdings of capital instruments and other TLAC liabilities 
referred to in sub-paragraph (c)(i) must be calculated in accordance 
with paragraph 6.1.5(o)(ii);  
 
(iii) holdings of other TLAC liabilities must be deducted from Tier 2 capital 
unless –  
 
(A) 
the holding falls within the 10% threshold provided for in 
paragraph 6.1.5(o)(i); or  
 
(B) 
the following conditions are met: 
 
(I) 
the holding has been designated by the Reporting Bank 
to 
be 
treated 
in 
accordance 
with 
paragraph  
6.3.10(c)(iii); 
 
(II)  
the holding is in the Reporting Bank’s trading book; 
 
(III) 
the holding is sold within 30 business days of the date 
of its acquisition;  
 
 
148 
For positions in the trading book, if the Reporting Bank has a contractual right or obligation to sell a long 
equity position at a specific point in time and the counterparty in the contract has an obligation to purchase 
the long equity position if the Reporting Bank exercises its right to sell, this point in time may be treated 
as the maturity of the long position, and the maturity of the long and short positions are deemed to be 
matched.       
149 
For a position hedged against market risk where the hedge does not qualify to offset the gross long position 
for the purposes of determining the amount to be deducted, the Reporting Bank may choose to include the 
long position in its calculation of market RWA, in addition to deducting the long position. Where the hedge 
qualifies to offset the gross long position, the Reporting Bank may choose to exclude both the gross long 
position and the hedge from its calculation of market RWA.  
150 
Where a Reporting Bank uses a short position in an index to hedge a long position, the portion of the index 
that is composed of the same underlying long exposure that is being hedged may be used to offset the 
long position only if (a) both the long position and the hedge are held in the trading book; (b) the positions 
are accounted for at fair value; and (c) the hedge is recognised as effective under the Reporting Bank’s 
internal control processes.

such holdings are, in aggregate and on a gross long 
basis, less than 5% of the Reporting Bank’s common 
equity (after applying the regulatory adjustments 
listed in paragraph 6.1.5(a) to (n)); 
 
(iv) if a holding designated under paragraph 6.3.10(c)(iii) no longer 
meets any of the conditions set out in that paragraph, it must be 
deducted in full from Tier 2 capital. Once a holding has been 
designated under paragraph 6.3.10(c)(iii), it may not subsequently 
be included within the 10% threshold referred to in paragraph 
6.1.5(o)(i); 
 
(v) 
the amount of holdings of other TLAC liabilities covered by the 5% 
threshold described in paragraph 6.3.10(c)(iii) and (iv) and are not 
deducted must continue to be risk-weighted151;  
 
(vi)  the amount of total holdings of capital instruments and other TLAC 
liabilities not covered by the 5% threshold described in paragraph 
6.3.10(c)(iii) to (iv) that do not exceed the 10% threshold calculated 
in accordance with paragraph 6.1.5(o)(i) and are not deducted must 
continue to be risk-weighted152. For the application of risk-weighting, 
the amount of the holdings must be allocated on a pro rata basis 
between those below and those above the threshold; 
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank must deduct investments in the Tier 2 capital 
instruments and other TLAC liabilities of unconsolidated financial 
institutions in which the Reporting Bank holds a major stake (including 
insurance subsidiaries), in the calculation of Tier 2 Capital153. The total of 
such investments must be calculated as follows:  
 
(i) 
direct, indirect and synthetic holdings must be included. The 
Reporting Bank must look through holdings of index securities to 
determine the underlying holdings of Tier 2 capital instruments and 
other TLAC liabilities. The Reporting Bank may, with the prior 
approval of the Authority, use a conservative estimate154. If the

the Authority may specify in writing to the Reporting Bank for the purposes 
of this paragraph.

For the purposes of paragraph 6.3.10, indirect holdings of capital instruments 
and other TLAC liabilities refer to exposures or parts of exposures that, if a direct holding 
loses its value, will result in a loss to the Reporting Bank substantially equivalent to the 
loss in value of the direct holding. 
 
 
 Qualifying Capital Instruments Issued by Fully Consolidated Subsidiaries 
Recognised as Eligible Total Capital 
 
6.3.12  
A Reporting Bank may recognise CET1 capital instruments, AT1 capital 
instruments and Tier 2 capital instruments issued by a fully consolidated subsidiary of a 
Reporting Bank to third party investors (including amounts under paragraphs 6.1.10, 6.2.8

For positions in the trading book, if the Reporting Bank has a contractual right or obligation to sell a long 
equity position at a specific point in time and the counterparty in the contract has an obligation to purchase

as the maturity of the long position, and the maturity of the long and short positions are deemed to be 
matched.

For a position hedged against market risk where the hedge does not qualify to offset the gross long position 
for the purposes of determining the amount to be deducted, the Reporting Bank may choose to include the

qualifies to offset the gross long position, the Reporting Bank may choose to exclude both the gross long 
position and the hedge from its calculation of market RWA.

Where a Reporting Bank uses a short position in an index to hedge a long position, the portion of the index 
that is composed of the same underlying long exposure that is being hedged may be used to offset the

and 6.2.9) as Eligible Total Capital only if the capital instruments would, if issued by the 
Reporting Bank, meet all of the criteria for classification as Tier 1 Capital or Tier 2 
Capital158. The Reporting Bank must calculate the amount that will be recognised as Eligible 
Total Capital as follows (please refer to Annex 6A for an illustrative example):  
(a) 
total capital of the subsidiary issued to third party investors; less 
 
(b) 
the surplus Eligible Total Capital of the subsidiary attributable to third 
party investors;  
 
where – 
 
(i) 
total capital of the subsidiary issued to third party investors means 
the sum of Tier 1 capital of the subsidiary and Tier 2 capital 
instruments issued by the subsidiary which are owned by third party 
investors; 
 
(ii) 
the surplus Eligible Total Capital of the subsidiary is calculated as the 
Eligible Total Capital of the subsidiary, minus the lower of – 
 
(A) 
12.5%159 of the subsidiary’s total RWA; and 
 
(B) 
12.5%160 of the consolidated RWA attributable to the 
subsidiary; and 
 
(iii) 
the surplus Eligible Total Capital of the subsidiary attributable to third 
party investors is calculated by multiplying the surplus Eligible Total 
Capital of the subsidiary calculated in sub-paragraph (b)(ii), by the 
percentage of total capital that is held by third party investors.  
 
A Reporting Bank when recognising the amount of Eligible Total Capital calculated in this 
paragraph as Tier 2 Capital, must exclude amounts recognised as CET1 Capital under 
paragraph 6.1.10 and amounts recognised as AT1 Capital under paragraphs 6.2.8 and 
6.2.9.  
 
6.3.13  
Where capital instruments purchased by third party investors are issued for and 
on behalf of a Reporting Bank out of an SPE, the Reporting Bank may include such capital 
 
158 
CET1 capital instruments, AT1 capital instruments and Tier 2 capital instruments should meet all of the 
criteria for classification as CET1 capital instruments, AT1 capital instruments and Tier 2 capital instruments, 
respectively. 
159 
This represents the sum of the minimum Total CAR of 10% and Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5% that 
is applicable to the banking group. Where the Reporting Bank is not designated by the Authority as a D-
SIB, the ratios set out in paragraph 64 of “Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks 
and banking systems” issued by the BCBS in December 2010 (last revised in June 2011), will apply  
(i.e. 10.5% of the subsidiary’s total RWA, which represents the sum of the minimum Total CAR of 8% and 
Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%).

instruments in its Tier 2 Capital and treat such capital instruments as if the Reporting Bank 
itself had issued the capital instruments directly to the third party investors, only if the 
capital instruments meet all the relevant entry criteria and the only asset of the SPE is its 
investment in the capital instruments of the Reporting Bank in a form that meets or 
exceeds all the relevant entry criteria (as required by the criterion set out in paragraph 
6.3.6(k) for Tier 2 Capital). In cases where the capital instruments have been issued to 
third party investors through an SPE by a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Reporting 
Bank, the Reporting Bank may, subject to the requirements of this paragraph in relation 
to capital instruments issued through an SPE, treat such capital instruments as if the 
subsidiary itself had issued the capital instruments directly to third party investors and 
may include such capital instruments in the Reporting Bank’s consolidated Tier 2 Capital 
in accordance with the treatment outlined in paragraph 6.3.12.  
 
 
TLAC Holdings 
 
6.3.14 
For the purposes of this part, other TLAC liabilities include – 
 
(a) 
all direct, indirect and synthetic investments in the instruments of a G-SIB 
resolution entity that are eligible to be recognised as external TLAC but 
that do not otherwise qualify as regulatory capital161 for the issuing G-SIB, 
with the exception of instruments excluded by paragraph 6.3.15; and 
 
(b) 
all holdings of instruments issued by a G-SIB resolution entity that rank 
pari passu to any instruments included in sub-paragraph (a), with the 
exceptions of – 
 
(i) instruments listed as liabilities excluded from TLAC in Section 10 of the 
FSB TLAC Term Sheet (“Excluded Liabilities”); and  
 
(ii) instruments ranking pari passu with instruments eligible to be 
recognised as TLAC by virtue of the exemptions to the subordination 
requirements in section 11 of the FSB TLAC Term Sheet. 
 
6.3.15 
Where a G-SIB is permitted to recognise instruments ranking pari passu to 
Excluded Liabilities as external TLAC instruments162, a Reporting Bank must subject its 
holdings of those instruments to a proportionate deduction approach. Under this approach, 
only a proportion of holdings of instruments that are eligible to be recognised as external 
TLAC by virtue of the exemptions to the subordination requirements set out in the 
penultimate paragraph of section 11 of the FSB TLAC Term Sheet will be considered a 
holding of TLAC by the Reporting Bank. The proportion is calculated as:  
 
(a) 
the funding issued by the G-SIB resolution entity that ranks pari passu 
with Excluded Liabilities and that is recognised as external TLAC by the G-
SIB resolution entity; divided by  
 
 
161     Tier 2 instruments that no longer count in full as regulatory capital (as a result of having a residual maturity 
of less than 5 years) continue to be recognised in full as a Tier 2 instrument by the Reporting Bank for the 
regulatory adjustments in this part. 
162  
In certain countries or jurisdictions, G-SIBs may be permitted to recognise instruments ranking pari passu 
to Excluded Liabilities as external TLAC, up to a limit, in accordance with the exemptions to the 
subordination requirements set out in the penultimate paragraph of section 11 of the FSB TLAC Term Sheet.

6-40 
(b) 
the funding issued by the G-SIB resolution entity that ranks pari passu 
with Excluded Liabilities and that would be recognised as external TLAC if 
the subordination requirement was not applied163.  
 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its holdings of other TLAC liabilities of the respective 
issuing G-SIB resolution entities based on the latest available public information provided 
by the issuing G-SIBs on the proportion to be used. 
 
6.3.16 
The Reporting Bank must apply the regulatory adjustments relating to TLAC 
holdings set out in this part from the date on which the issuing G-SIB becomes subject to 
a minimum TLAC requirement164. 
 
 
 
 
 
163    For example, if a G-SIB resolution entity has funding that ranks pari passu with Excluded Liabilities equal 
to 5% of RWAs and receives partial recognition of these instruments as external TLAC equivalent to 3.5% 
of RWAs, then a Reporting Bank holding such instruments must include only 70% (= 3.5 / 5) of such 
instruments in calculating its TLAC holdings. The same proportion should be applied by the Reporting Bank 
to any indirect or synthetic investments in instruments ranking pari passu with Excluded Liabilities and 
eligible to be recognised as TLAC by virtue of the exemptions to the subordination requirements set out in 
the penultimate paragraph of section 11 of the FSB TLAC Term Sheet. 
164 
The conformance period is set out in section 21 of the FSB TLAC Term Sheet. In summary, firms that have 
been designated as G-SIBs before end-2015 and continue to be designated thereafter, with the exception 
of such firms headquartered in an emerging market economy, will have to meet the TLAC requirements 
from 1 January 2019. For firms headquartered in emerging market economies, the requirements will apply 
from 1 January 2025 at the latest; this may be accelerated in certain circumstances.

paragraph 1.9 of Annex 6B;  
 
(vi) where the agreements and offering documents governing the 
issuance of the AT1 capital instrument or Tier 2 capital instrument 
are governed by the laws of a country or jurisdiction other than 
Singapore, a written external legal opinion from an advocate and 
solicitor qualified to practise Singapore law, that he has reviewed all 
the agreements and offering documents governing the issuance, 
including any legal opinion from foreign law practitioners provided 
pursuant to paragraph 6.4.1(b)(iii) and the memorandum of 
compliance, and confirms that the memorandum of compliance read 
together with such agreements, offering documents, legal opinions 
and any letter of undertaking provided by the Reporting Bank or any 
banking group entity address the requirements of paragraphs 6.2.2

MINORITY INTEREST AND OTHER CAPITAL ISSUED BY FULLY CONSOLIDATED 
SUBSIDIARIES HELD BY THIRD PARTY INVESTORS –  
AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE  
 
This Annex illustrates the treatment of minority interest and other capital issued by 
subsidiaries to third party investors, set out in paragraphs 6.1.10, 6.2.8, 6.2.9, 6.3.12 and 
6.3.13.  
 
A banking group consists of 2 legal entities that are both banks. Bank P is the parent and 
Bank S is the subsidiary and their unconsolidated balance sheets are set out below.

The balance sheet of Bank P shows that in addition to its loans to customers, it owns 70% 
of the ordinary shares of Bank S, 80% of the AT1 capital of Bank S and 25% of the Tier 2 
capital of Bank S. The ownership of the capital of Bank S is therefore as follows:

For illustrative purposes Bank S is assumed to have RWA of 100. In this example, the 
minimum capital requirements of Bank S and the subsidiary’s contribution to the 
consolidated requirements are the same since Bank S does not have any loans to Bank P. 
This means that it is subject to the following minimum plus capital conservation buffer 
requirements and has the following surplus capital:

Annex 6B 
 
 
REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE LOSS ABSORBENCY AT THE POINT OF  
NON-VIABILITY 
 
1.1 
Paragraphs 6.2.2(s) and 6.3.6(o) require that the terms and conditions of AT1 
capital instruments and Tier 2 capital instruments contain provisions which ensure their 
loss absorbency at the point of non-viability. A Reporting Bank must have a provision in 
the terms and conditions of all AT1 capital instruments and Tier 2 capital instruments 
issued by the Reporting Bank that requires such instruments, at the option of the 
Authority, to either be partially or fully written off or converted into ordinary shares upon 
the occurrence of the trigger event.  The Reporting Bank must ensure that the write-off of 
any capital instruments issued by an SPE to investors mirrors the write-off of capital 
instruments issued by the Reporting Bank to the SPE, and the write-off or conversion must 
not constitute an event of default for the capital instruments. The Reporting Bank must 
consult the Authority on such arrangements in advance, to allow adequate time for review.   
 
1.2 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that any compensation paid to the instrument 
holders as a result of a write-off is paid immediately in the form of ordinary shares of the 
Reporting Bank (including any successor in resolution). The Reporting Bank must approach 
the Authority before the issuance of ordinary shares of the holding company of the 
Reporting Bank, where such shares are paid as compensation to the holders of the capital 
instrument. 
 
1.3 
A Reporting Bank must maintain at all times, all prior authorisation necessary 
to immediately issue the relevant number of ordinary shares specified in the capital 
instrument's terms and conditions should the trigger event occur. The Reporting Bank 
must ensure that the conversion formula for determining the number of ordinary shares 
to be issued upon conversion of the capital instrument is fixed at the point of issuance, 
and  includes a limit on the maximum number of ordinary shares that would be issued 
upon conversion.  
 
1.4 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the trigger event is the earlier of:  
 
(a) 
the Authority notifying the Reporting Bank in writing that the Authority is 
of the opinion that a write-off or conversion is necessary, without which 
the Reporting Bank would become non-viable; and  
 
(b) 
the Authority’s decision to make a public sector injection of capital, or 
equivalent support, without which the Reporting Bank would have become 
non-viable, as determined by the Authority. 
 
1.5 
The Authority may take into account, among other considerations, the 
following165 in assessing a Reporting Bank’s viability:  
 
 
165 
In its assessment, the Authority will bear in mind the aim of the requirements, which is to ensure loss 
absorbency at the point of non-viability. The Authority will also have full discretion to not trigger the 
provision under paragraph 1.1 of Annex 6B even if the Reporting Bank is assessed to have ceased, or is 
about to cease, to be viable.   
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-47 
(a) whether the assets of the Reporting Bank are, in the Authority’s opinion, 
sufficient to provide adequate protection to the Reporting Bank’s 
depositors and creditors;  
 
(b) whether the Reporting Bank has lost the confidence of depositors, other 
creditors or the public. This may be characterised by ongoing increased 
difficulty of the Reporting Bank in obtaining or rolling over short-term 
funding;  
 
(c) whether the Reporting Bank’s regulatory capital has, in the Authority’s 
opinion, reached a level, or is eroding in a manner, that may detrimentally 
affect its depositors or creditors;  
 
(d) whether the Reporting Bank failed to pay any liability that has become due 
and payable or, in the Authority’s opinion, will not be able to pay its 
liabilities as they become due and payable; 
 
(e) whether the Reporting Bank failed to comply with an order of the Authority 
to increase its capital; 
 
(f) whether in the Authority’s opinion, any other state of affairs exists in 
respect of the Reporting Bank that may be materially prejudicial to the 
interests of the Reporting Bank’s depositors or creditors or the owners of 
any assets under the Reporting Bank’s administration;  
 
(g) whether the Reporting Bank is able to recapitalise on its own through the 
issuance of ordinary shares or other forms of regulatory capital.  
 
1.6 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the issuance of any new ordinary shares 
as a result of the trigger event  occurs prior to any public sector injection of capital so that 
the capital provided by the public sector is not diluted. 
 
 
Additional requirements for capital instruments issued by fully consolidated 
subsidiaries  
 
1.7 
Where a Reporting Bank intends to include the AT1 capital instruments and Tier 
2 capital instruments issued by its subsidiary or issued for and on behalf of its subsidiary 
by an SPE in the consolidated group’s regulatory capital at the Group level, the Reporting 
Bank may do so, to the extent permitted by the rules on eligibility of capital issued out of 
subsidiaries and held by third party investors set out in paragraphs 6.1.10, 6.2.8, 6.2.9, 
6.3.12, 6.3.13 of this Part, if the terms and conditions specify an additional trigger event. 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that this additional trigger event is the earlier of –  
 
(a) 
the Authority notifying the Reporting Bank in writing that the Authority is 
of the opinion that a write-off or conversion is necessary, without which 
the Reporting Bank would become non-viable; and 
 
(b) 
the Authority’s decision to make a public sector injection of capital, or 
equivalent support, without which the Reporting Bank would have become 
non-viable, as determined by the Authority. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-48 
1.8 
For the purposes of paragraph 1.7, the Reporting Bank must ensure that any 
ordinary shares paid as compensation to the holders of the capital instrument are ordinary 
shares of either the subsidiary or of the Reporting Bank (including any successor in 
resolution). The Reporting Bank must approach the Authority before the issuance of 
ordinary shares paid as compensation to the holders of the capital instrument to be those 
of the holding company of the Reporting Bank.  
 
 
Submission requirements 
 
1.9 
For the purposes of ensuring compliance with the above requirements, the 
Reporting Bank must submit the following information and documents to the Authority 
before including any issuance of capital instruments as AT1 Capital or Tier 2 Capital: 
 
(a)  an external legal opinion confirming that the write-off or conversion 
feature at the point of non-viability is enforceable, and that there are no 
impediments to the write-off or conversion of the instrument into ordinary 
shares of the Reporting Bank (or a banking group entity, where applicable) 
upon a trigger event;  
 
(b) 
where the terms of the instrument provide for trigger events in addition 
to the trigger events specified in this Annex, the rationale for these 
additional trigger events and an assessment of the possible market 
implications that might arise from the inclusion of these additional trigger 
events or upon a breach of these trigger events;   
 
(c) 
a detailed description of the rationale for the specified conversion method, 
including computations of the indicative dilution of the Reporting Bank’s 
ordinary shares that would occur upon a trigger event, and an explanation 
of why such a conversion approach would help to ensure or maintain the 
viability of the Reporting Bank.  
 
The Authority may require the Reporting Bank to submit additional information in such 
form and manner (as specified in writing by the Authority) before such capital instruments 
can be included as AT1 Capital or Tier 2 Capital.  
 
 
 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore

Annex 6C 
 
STANDARDS FOR A PRUDENT VALUATION FRAMEWORK  
 
 
1.1 
This Annex sets out the standards for valuing positions166 that are accounted 
for at fair value, whether they are in the trading book or the banking book of a Reporting 
Bank (such positions are referred to in this Annex as “positions”). 
 
1.2  
These standards are especially important for positions without actual market 
prices or observable inputs to valuation, as well as less liquid positions. The standards are 
not intended to require a Reporting Bank to change valuation procedures for financial 
reporting purposes.  
 
1.3 
The Authority will review the implementation of these standards by a Reporting 
Bank to assess the quality of its risk management systems, including whether the 
Reporting Bank has taken appropriate valuation adjustments for regulatory purposes 
under paragraphs 1.17 to 1.20 of this Annex. The degree of consistency between the 
Reporting Bank’s valuation procedures and these standards will be a factor in the 
Authority’s assessment of whether the Reporting Bank must take a valuation adjustment 
for regulatory purposes under paragraphs 1.17 to 1.20 of this Annex.  
 
 
Governance Structure 
 
1.4 
A Reporting Bank must have in place a clear and delineated governance 
structure that facilitates the setting, implementation and review of its policies and 
procedures on valuation. A Reporting Bank must ensure that the governance structure 
includes all of the following key elements:  
 
(a) 
approval by the Board for the overall valuation framework for positions of 
the Reporting Bank;  
 
(b) 
periodic review by the Board on the valuation framework to ensure it 
remains appropriate, especially if any major acquisition, disposal or 
business changes have occurred; 
 
(c) 
approval by the Board on all significant changes to a Reporting Bank’s 
valuation policies and procedures;  
 
(d) 
significant involvement by senior management of a Reporting Bank in the 
design and implementation of the controls and methodologies within the 
approved valuation framework;  
 
(e) 
proper oversight by senior management on any significant breach of 
valuation policies and other significant issues arising from the valuation 
process. The Reporting Bank must document all breaches of valuation 
policies and issues arising from the valuation process, and the actions 
taken. 
 
166  
To avoid doubt, this includes positions in instruments that are in scope for credit risk capital requirements  
and positions in instruments that are in scope for market risk capital requirements.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-50 
Policies, Systems and Controls  
 
1.5 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its senior management establishes and 
maintains adequate policies, systems and controls to ensure that its valuation 
methodologies are robust and reliable.  
 
1.6 
A Reporting Bank must maintain sufficient documentation on its valuation 
policies and procedures. The Reporting Bank must ensure that such documentation 
contains all of the following key elements: 
 
(a)  responsibilities of the various units involved in the determination of the 
valuation; 
 
(b)  sources of market information and provisions for regular reviews of their 
appropriateness; 
 
(c)  policies for the use of unobservable inputs reflecting the Reporting Bank’s 
assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the position; 
 
(d)  frequency of independent valuation; 
 
(e)  timing for obtaining closing prices; 
 
(f) 
procedures for adjusting valuations;  
 
(g)  end-of-the-month and other ad-hoc verification procedures167. 
 
1.7 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its units or departments accountable for the 
valuation process maintain clear reporting lines which are independent of the market risk-
taking function of the Reporting Bank168.  
 
1.8 
A Reporting Bank must integrate its valuation systems with other risk 
management systems within the Reporting Bank.  
 
1.9 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its IA or external auditors conduct reviews 
of the independent price verification procedures and control processes on an annual basis.  
 
 
Marking-to-Market 
 
1.10 
A Reporting Bank must mark-to-market its positions using readily available 
close out prices169 that are sourced independently.  
 
 
167  
This may include collateral reconciliations to position values, a review of similar recent transactions and 
early termination analysis. 
168  
A Reporting Bank should ensure that the reporting line is ultimately to an executive director of the Board 
of the Reporting Bank. 
169  
Examples of readily available close out prices include exchange prices, screen prices, or quotes from several  
independent reputable brokers.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-51 
1.11 
A Reporting Bank must mark-to-market its positions on a regular and consistent 
basis and this must be done at least daily170. The Reporting Bank must use the more 
prudent side of bid and offer unless the Reporting Bank is a significant market maker in a 
particular position type and has the ability to close out at mid-market. 
 
 
Marking-to-Model 
 
1.12 
Despite paragraph 1.11 of this Annex, where marking-to-market is not possible, 
a Reporting Bank must mark-to-model. 
 
1.13 
A Reporting Bank must meet all of the following requirements when 
implementing its marked-to-model valuation framework: 
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank must ensure its senior management is aware of the 
elements of the trading book or of other fair-valued positions which are 
marked-to-model and understand the materiality of the uncertainty this 
creates in the reporting of the risk or performance of the business;  
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank must ensure that market inputs are sourced externally 
and the appropriateness of market inputs for a particular position being 
valued is reviewed on a regular basis; 
 
(c)  the Reporting Bank must ensure that, where available, generally accepted 
valuation methodologies for particular products are used; 
 
(d)  where a model used in the valuation framework171 is developed by the 
Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the model, and any 
significant changes made to an existing model, are validated by a unit, or 
department, independent of both the development process and the front 
office, and that the validation includes validating the mathematics, the 
assumptions and the software implementation; 
 
(e)  the Reporting Bank must ensure that there are formal change control 
procedures in place for changes to models used in the valuation 
framework, and a copy of each model is maintained, with access controls 
in place to prevent unauthorised changes to the models, and periodically 
used to check the accuracy of valuations; 
 
(f)  the Reporting Bank must be aware of the weaknesses of each model used 
in the valuation framework and assess how best to reflect those in the 
model valuation; 
 
 
170  
A Reporting Bank should maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of 
unobservable inputs when estimating fair value using a valuation technique. However, observable inputs, 
such as transactions, may not be relevant, such as in a forced liquidation or distressed sale, or transactions 
may not be observable, such as when markets are inactive. In such cases, the Reporting Bank should 
consider the observable inputs, although such inputs may not be determinative of the fair value of a 
position. 
171  
The Reporting Bank should ensure that each model used in the valuation framework is developed or 
approved by a unit or department independent of the front office and based on reasonable and appropriate 
assumptions which have been documented, and challenged and assessed by suitably qualified parties 
independent of the development process.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-52 
(g)  the Reporting Bank must ensure that each model used in the valuation 
framework is reviewed to ascertain the accuracy of its performance, and 
such review includes ascertaining the reasonableness of assumptions 
made, analysing how changes in risk factors affect the profit and loss of a 
position and comparing how close actual close out values are to model 
valuations, and is conducted –    
  
(i)  
periodically; and  
 
(ii)  when there are changes in the model or in the assumptions resulting 
from developments in market conditions,  
 
and the Reporting Bank must document, for each model, the outcome of 
the review, the date of the last review and the scheduled date for the next 
review; 
 
(h) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that valuation adjustments are made as 
appropriate, including to address the uncertainty of a model valuation (see 
also paragraphs 1.15 to 1.20 of this Annex). 
 
 
Independent Price Verification172 
 
1.14 
A Reporting Bank must verify the market prices and model inputs used for 
marking-to-market and marking-to-model, respectively, for appropriateness and 
accuracy. A Reporting Bank must ensure that price verification is performed by a unit 
independent of the market risk-taking function at a frequency that is commensurate with 
the nature of the market or trading activity, and in any case not less frequently than once 
a month.173,174  
 
 
Valuation Adjustments  
 
1.15 
A Reporting Bank must establish and maintain procedures for considering 
valuation adjustments175, whether the position is marked-to-market using market prices, 
observable inputs or third-party valuations, or marked-to-model.  
 
1.16 
While the list below is not intended to be exhaustive, a Reporting Bank must 
make valuation adjustments176, where relevant, for the following:  
 
(a)  unearned credit spreads; 
 
 
172  
Independent price verification is a process by which market prices or model inputs are regularly and 
independently verified for accuracy.  
173  
A Reporting Bank need not perform independent price verification daily, since the daily mark-to-market 
process should reveal any error or bias in pricing, which should result in the elimination of inaccurate daily 
marks. 
174  
A Reporting Bank should make independent unscheduled (e.g. mid-month) price verification of its positions. 
This should be performed especially if the Reporting Bank identifies potential or actual problems or 
inaccuracies in its valuation process and results. In the case where pricing sources are limited, e.g. only 
one available broker quote, measures such as valuation adjustments may be appropriate. 
175  
A Reporting Bank should make valuation adjustments at the position level, which means valuation 
adjustments should be made to the valuation of the net position in the same instrument. 
176  
The Reporting Bank should review the appropriateness of the valuation adjustments regularly. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore

(b)  close-out costs; 
 
(c)  operational risks; 
 
(d)  early termination; 
 
(e) 
investing and funding costs; 
 
(f)  future administrative costs;  
 
(g)  model risk. 
 
 
 
Adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital 
purposes 
 
1.17 
A Reporting Bank must establish and maintain procedures for judging the 
necessity of and calculating an adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions 
for regulatory capital purposes.177 A Reporting Bank must consider the need for an 
adjustment to a position’s valuation to reflect current illiquidity whether the position is 
marked-to-market using market prices, observable inputs or third-party valuations, or 
marked-to-model. 
 
1.18 
Where assumptions made about liquidity by a Reporting Bank in calculating its 
market risk capital requirements are inconsistent with the Reporting Bank’s ability to sell 
or hedge out less liquid positions178, a Reporting Bank must make an adjustment to the 
current valuation of these positions, where appropriate, and review their continued 
appropriateness on an ongoing basis. The Reporting Bank must consider all relevant 
factors and, at a minimum, the following factors when determining the appropriateness of 
the valuation adjustment for less liquid positions:  
 
(a)  the amount of time it would take to hedge out the risks within the position; 
 
(b)  the average volatility of bid and offer spreads; 
 
(c)  the availability of independent market quotes (including the number and 
identity of market makers); 
 
(d)  the average trading volume and volatility of trading volumes (including 
trading volumes during periods of market stress); 
 
(e)  market concentrations179; 
 
(f)  the ageing of positions180; 
 
 
177  
This adjustment may be in addition to any changes to the value of the position required for financial 
reporting purposes. 
178  
Reduced liquidity may have arisen from market events. 
179  
A Reporting Bank should consider the impact of liquidating concentrated positions when determining the 
valuation adjustment.  
180  
A Reporting Bank should consider the impact of liquidating stale positions when determining the valuation 
adjustment.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
6-54 
(g)  the extent to which valuation relies on marking-to-model; 
 
(h)  the impact of other model risks, which the Reporting Bank has not 
calculated valuation adjustments for under paragraph 1.17 of this Annex. 
 
1.19 
For complex products including, but not limited to, securitisation exposures and 
n-th-to-default credit derivatives, a Reporting Bank must explicitly assess the need for 
valuation adjustments to reflect 2 forms of model risk: the model risk associated with 
using a possibly incorrect valuation methodology and the risk associated with using 
unobservable (and possibly incorrect) calibration parameters in the valuation model. 
 
1.20 
In some circumstances, it is possible that the adjustments to the current 
valuation of less liquid positions made under paragraph 1.17 of this Annex may exceed 
those valuation adjustments made under financial reporting standards and paragraphs 
1.15 and 1.16 of this Annex. Where this occurs, a Reporting Bank must deduct the 
difference in the calculation of CET1 Capital.

A Reporting Bank may apply a “look-through” approach to senior securitisation 
exposures, where the risk weight applied to a senior securitisation exposure is capped at 
the exposure weighted-average risk weight applicable to the underlying exposures, 
provided that the Reporting Bank has knowledge of the composition of the underlying 
exposures at all times – 
 
(a) 
where the Reporting Bank exclusively uses either the SA(CR) or the IRBA 
to calculate capital requirements for the underlying pool, the risk weight 
applied to the senior securitisation exposure is capped at the exposure 
weighted-average risk weight applicable to the underlying exposures 
under the SA(CR) or IRBA respectively; and 
 
(b) 
in the case of mixed pools – 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-9  
(i) 
when applying the SEC-IRBA, the risk weight applied to the senior 
securitisation exposure is capped at the exposure weighted-average 
risk weight calculated using –   
 
(A) the SA(CR) risk weights for the portion of the underlying pool 
that would constitute an SA pool; and  
 
(B) the IRBA risk weights for the portion of the underlying pool that 
would constitute an IRB pool; and 
 
(ii) 
when applying the SEC-SA, the SEC-ERBA, or the SEC-IAA, the risk 
weight applied to the senior securitisation exposure is capped at the 
exposure weighted-average risk weight applicable to the underlying 
assets under the SA(CR), whether or not the Reporting Bank is able 
to use the IRBA to calculate their risk weights. 
 
The Reporting Bank must calculate the applicable risk weight under the IRBA taking into 
account the expected loss multiplied by 12.5. 
 
7.1.16 
Where the risk weight cap results in a lower risk weight than the floor risk 
weight of 15%, a Reporting Bank must apply the risk weight resulting from the cap. 
 
7.1.17 
A Reporting Bank must not apply the cap on risk weights described in 
paragraphs 7.1.15 to 7.1.16 to resecuritisation exposures. 
 
 
Maximum Credit Risk-Weighted Exposure Amounts 
 
7.1.18 
A Reporting Bank (as an originator of or investor in a securitisation) using the 
SEC-IRBA for a securitisation exposure may cap the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
for the securitisation exposures it holds in the same securitisation in accordance with 
paragraph 7.1.20.  
 
7.1.19 
A Reporting Bank (as an originator of a securitisation) using the SEC-ERBA, the 
SEC-IAA or the SEC-SA for a securitisation exposure may cap the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount for the securitisation exposures it holds in the same securitisation in 
accordance with paragraph 7.1.20. 
 
7.1.20 
A Reporting Bank which is capping the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
must apply a maximum aggregated credit risk-weighted exposure for its securitisation 
exposures in the same securitisation of P x KP x 12.5, with P and KP defined as follows:  
 
(a) P: The largest proportion of interest that the Reporting Bank holds across 
all tranches of a given pool – 
 
(i) 
if the Reporting Bank’s securitisation exposures all reside in a single 
tranche of a given securitisation, P equals the proportion (expressed 
as a percentage) of securitisation exposures that the Reporting Bank 
holds in that given tranche (calculated as the total nominal amount 
of the Reporting Bank’s securitisation exposures in the tranche 
divided by the nominal amount of the tranche); and 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-10  
(ii) 
if the Reporting Bank’s securitisation exposures reside in different 
tranches of a given securitisation, P equals the maximum proportion 
of interest across tranches, where the proportion of interest for each 
of the different tranches is calculated as described above; 
 
(b) 
KP: The capital requirement for the underlying pool – 
 
(i) 
for an IRB pool, KP equals KIRB as calculated in paragraphs 7.6.21 to 
7.6.32; 
 
(ii) 
for an SA pool, KP equals KSA as calculated in paragraphs 7.6.63 to 
7.6.69; and 
 
(iii) for a mixed pool, KP equals the exposure-weighted average capital 
requirement of the underlying pool using KSA for the proportion of 
the underlying pool for which the Reporting Bank cannot calculate 
KIRB, and KIRB for the proportion of the underlying pool for which the 
Reporting Bank can calculate KIRB. 
 
7.1.21 
Despite the maximum risk-weighted exposure cap, a Reporting Bank must 
deduct the entire amount of any gain on sale and credit-enhancing interest-only strips 
arising from the securitisation transaction in accordance with paragraph 6.1.5(f) and (g). 
 
7.1.22 
A Reporting Bank must not apply the cap on credit risk-weighted exposure 
amounts described in paragraphs 7.1.18 to 7.1.20 to resecuritisation exposures. 
 
7.1.23 
A Reporting Bank which is adjusting its credit risk-weighted exposure amounts 
to recognise the effects of credit risk mitigation pursuant to paragraph 7.1.8(c) must –  
 
(a) 
compute an effective risk weight for each securitisation exposure, using 
the following formula:   
 
 
Effective risk weight = Credit RWE / Exposure   
  
where – 
 
(i) 
“Effective risk weight” refers to the risk weight applicable to the 
unprotected portion of the securitisation exposure; 
 
(ii) 
“Credit RWE” refers to the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for 
that securitisation exposure calculated in accordance with paragraph 
7.1.14(a) to (c), after the application of any caps; and 
 
(iii) “Exposure” refers to E, or where applicable E*, for that securitisation 
exposure calculated in accordance with paragraph 7.1.14(a); and 
 
(b) 
recognise the effects of credit risk mitigation in accordance with Sub-
division 13 of Division 6 of this Part, using the effective risk weight 
calculated in sub-paragraph (a) as the risk weight that is applicable to the 
unprotected portion of the securitisation exposure.

have not been addressed in this Division.  
 
7.2.4 
A Reporting Bank must calculate –   
 
(a) 
E, or where applicable E*, for any SA(CR) exposure, SEC-IRBA exposure, 
SEC-ERBA exposure, SEC-IAA exposure or SEC-SA exposure, net of any – 
 
(i) 
specific allowance (including partial write-offs) attributable to such 
SA(CR) exposure, SEC-IRBA exposure, SEC-ERBA exposure, SEC-IAA 
exposure or SEC-SA exposure, as determined in accordance with the 
Accounting Standards; and  
 
(ii) purchase price discount attributable to such SEC-IRBA exposure, 
SEC-ERBA exposure, SEC-IAA exposure or SEC-SA exposure; and 
 
(b) 
EAD, or where applicable EAD*, for any IRBA exposure gross of any 
specific allowance or partial write-offs attributable to such IRBA exposure 
as determined in accordance with the Accounting Standards. 
 
7.2.5 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.2.4(b), the Reporting Bank must ensure that 
the EAD on drawn amounts is not less than the sum of –  
 
(a) 
the amount by which a Reporting Bank’s regulatory capital would be 
reduced if the exposure were written-off fully; and  
 
(b) 
any specific allowances and partial write-offs.  
 
The difference between the EAD and the sum of (a) and (b), where positive, is referred to 
as a discount. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the calculation of EAD, 
or where applicable EAD*, and the calculation of IRBA RWA, is independent of any 
discounts.

includes only the portion of revaluation surpluses or accumulated 
revaluation gains that have been included as CET1 Capital (equivalent to 
the sum of historical cost and 45% of the revaluation surpluses or 
accumulated revaluation gains, less depreciation and any allowance for 
impairment).

In the case of a lease where the Reporting Bank is the lessor and is exposed to 
residual value risk (i.e. potential loss due to the fair value of the leased asset declining 
below the estimate of its residual value reflected on the balance sheet of the Reporting 
Bank at lease inception), the Reporting Bank must calculate –  
 
(a) 
an exposure to the lessee equivalent to the discounted lease payment 
stream; and  
 
(b) 
an exposure to the residual value of the leased assets equivalent to the 
estimate of the residual value reflected in the balance sheet of the 
Reporting Bank.  
 
7.2.8 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must calculate E or EAD of any asset on the 
balance sheet of the Reporting Bank that is – 
 
(a)  lent; or  
 
(b)  posted as collateral,  
 
where the credit risk of the asset remains with the Reporting Bank, in accordance with 
paragraph 7.2.4.  
 
 
201 
A Reporting Bank should allocate any foreign exchange transaction or translation gain or loss from a foreign 
currency-denominated on-balance sheet item as well as interest earned on a fixed income instrument to 
the exposure to which it accrues. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

7.2.9 
A Reporting Bank may recognise the effect of a qualifying on-balance sheet 
netting agreement for loans and deposits. However, the Reporting Bank must not 
recognise the effect of netting agreements relating to all other types of on-balance sheet 
assets and liabilities. To avoid doubt, this prohibition on the recognition of netting 
agreements does not apply to the calculation of E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for pre-
settlement counterparty exposures arising from derivative transactions and long 
settlement transactions under the SA-CCR set out in Annex 7D. 
 
7.2.10 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.2.9, a Reporting Bank must –   
 
(a) 
calculate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for loans; and 
 
(b) 
calculate E* or EAD*, whichever is applicable, as the net exposure of loans 
and deposits, by treating deposits as cash collateral and in accordance 
with paragraph 1.1 of Annex 7J, subject to all of the following: 
 
(i) 
all applicable haircuts in paragraph 1.1 of Annex 7J are zero, except 
where there is a currency mismatch between the loans and 
deposits covered under the qualifying on-balance sheet netting 
agreement;  
 
(ii) 
where there is a currency mismatch between the loans and 
deposits held, the Reporting Bank must reduce the amount of 
exposure to be netted by applying a haircut in accordance with 
paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5 of Annex 7J, and apply a 10-business day 
holding period;  
 
(iii) 
where there is a maturity mismatch between the loans and 
deposits covered under the qualifying on-balance sheet netting 
agreement, 
the 
Reporting 
Bank 
must 
comply 
with 
the 
requirements set out in Section 7 of Annex 7H.

Sub-division 3:  Measurement202 of E or EAD for Off-balance Sheet Items Other 
than CCR Exposures 
 
7.2.11 
For an off-balance sheet item (other than a CCR exposure), which is an SA(CR) 
exposure, an exposure in equity investments in funds, or an exposure under the F-IRBA, 
a Reporting Bank must calculate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, by multiplying the 
notional amount with the applicable standardised CCF set out in Table 7B-1.  
 
7.2.12  
A Reporting Bank posting collateral for any transaction other than a CCR 
exposure must apply a 100% CCF to the fair value of the collateral.203 To avoid doubt, a 
Reporting Bank must calculate E or EAD for such posted collateral in addition to the 
calculation of E or EAD pursuant to paragraph 7.2.8, where applicable. 
 
7.2.13 
For an off-balance sheet item (other than a CCR exposure), which is an 
exposure under the A-IRBA, or the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class, a Reporting Bank 
must calculate EAD as follows: 
  
(a) 
in the case of an undrawn commitment to a revolving loan to extend credit, 
purchase assets or issue credit substitutes, where all of the following 
conditions are met:  
 
(i) 
the exposure is not subject to a standardised CCF of 100% as set out 
in Table 7B-1;  
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank meets the minimum requirements for estimating 
EAD as set out in Annex 7X, 
 
the Reporting Bank must calculate –   
 
(A) EAD of the off-balance sheet item by multiplying the notional amount 
of the item with the Reporting Bank’s own internal estimates of CCFs; 
or 
 
 
202  
A Reporting Bank should record a commitment (as defined in Annex 2A) as an exposure for regulatory 
capital purposes on the date at which it enters into the legal contract or agreement with the obligor, except 
in the following cases:     
(a) where the Reporting Bank faces operational constraints in recording the commitment immediately, 
such as checking that the legal contract or agreement is in order, such delay should not exceed 15 
business days; 
(b) where the Reporting Bank intends to recognise the effects of CRM of collateral, and the disbursement 
of the credit facility is conditional on such recognition being achieved, the Reporting Bank should record 
the commitment in respect of the credit facility on the date at which it is first able to recognise the 
credit risk mitigating effects of any collateral which meets all the requirements for recognition of 
collateral under Annex 7H; 
(c) where the commitment is in respect of a credit facility to an obligor which is to be used for the purposes 
of repaying an existing credit facility issued by the Reporting Bank to the same obligor, such as for 
refinancing, the Reporting Bank should record the commitment on the date at which the existing credit 
exposure will be repaid. In the case where the amount for the commitment exceeds the outstanding 
amount to be repaid for the existing credit exposure, the Reporting Bank should recognise the 
difference on the date at which the legal contract or agreement or commitment is entered into by the 
Reporting Bank, subject to sub-paragraphs (a) and (b). 
To avoid doubt, this does not affect the measurement of E or EAD for the commitment. 
203  
This is to account for the counterparty credit risk arising from the default of the obligor receiving such 
collateral. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-15  
(B) EAD of the total facility, consisting of both the on-balance sheet asset, 
and the off-balance sheet item, using the Reporting Bank’s own 
internal estimates of total facility EAD;  
 
(b) 
in any other case, the Reporting Bank must calculate EAD by multiplying 
the notional amount with the applicable standardised CCF set out in Table 
7B-1.204 
 
7.2.14 
In the case where a Reporting Bank uses its own internal estimates to calculate 
EAD in accordance with paragraph 7.2.13(a), the Reporting Bank must determine EAD as 
follows for exposures other than an exposure in the sovereign asset sub-class under 
paragraph 7.4.42(c):  
 
(a)  EAD for foreign exchange and interest rate commitments within a 
Reporting Bank’s IRBA retail asset class, if any, must be determined in 
accordance with paragraph 7.2.11;  
 
(b)  if the EAD of the off-balance sheet item calculated under paragraph 
7.2.13(a)(A) is lower than 50% of the exposure measurement that would 
have been calculated for the same off-balance sheet item under paragraph 
7.2.11, the Reporting Bank must use 50% of the exposure measurement 
that would have been calculated for the same off-balance sheet item under 
paragraph 7.2.11 as the EAD to calculate Credit RWE for that IRBA 
exposure under paragraph 7.1.5(e)(ii); 
 
(c)  if the EAD of the total facility calculated under paragraph 7.2.13(a)(B) is 
lower than the sum of – 
 
(i) 
the on-balance sheet amount that would have been calculated under 
Sub-division 2 of this Division; and 
 
(ii) 50% of the exposure measurement that would have been calculated 
for the off-balance sheet amount under paragraph 7.2.11,   
 
the Reporting Bank must use the sum of (c)(i) and (c)(ii) as the EAD to 
calculate Credit RWE for that IRBA exposure under paragraph 7.1.5(e)(ii).  
 
7.2.15 
For an off-balance sheet item (other than a CCR exposure) which is a 
securitisation exposure, a Reporting Bank must calculate E, by multiplying the notional 
amount with the applicable CCF set out in Annex 7C. 
 
7.2.16 
For the purposes of this Sub-division –    
 
(a) 
the notional amount of an off-balance sheet item refers to the amount 
which has been committed but is as yet undrawn; and  
 
 
204 
For example, this paragraph would apply to any of the following:   
(a) an undrawn commitment to a non-revolving loan;  
(b) an off-balance sheet item that is subject to a standardised CCF of 100%;  
(c) an exposure where the Reporting Bank does not meet the minimum requirements for estimating EAD 
as set out in Annex 7X.   


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-16  
(b) 
a Reporting Bank which is exposed to the risk of the underlying securities 
or commodities in – 
 
(i) 
an OTC derivative transaction;  
 
(ii) 
an exchange-traded derivative transaction;  
 
(iii) a long settlement transaction; or  
 
(iv) an SFT,  
 
where the transaction is in substance similar to a forward purchase or 
credit substitute, must calculate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for 
such an exposure in accordance with this Sub-division.  
 
7.2.17  
For the purposes of paragraph 7.2.16(a), a Reporting Bank must measure the 
notional amount of an off-balance sheet item denominated in a foreign currency, based 
on the current exchange rate. The Reporting Bank must apply the CCF to the lower of the 
value of the unused committed credit line, and the value which reflects any possible 
constraining availability of the facility 205. Where a Reporting Bank contends that the 
availability of a facility is constrained, the Reporting Bank must have sufficient line 
monitoring and management procedures to support this contention. 
 
7.2.18 
To avoid doubt, if a Reporting Bank has securitised only the drawn balances of 
revolving loans, the Reporting Bank must hold capital against the undrawn balances 
associated with the securitised exposures, and must calculate E or EAD, whichever is 
applicable, based on the applicable CCF set out in Annex 7B. For the purposes of this 
paragraph, a securitisation of revolving loans is a securitisation in which one or more 
underlying exposures represent, directly or indirectly, current or future draws on a 
revolving loan206.  
 
7.2.19 
To avoid doubt, where a Reporting Bank has provided unfunded credit 
protection via a total rate of return swap, the Reporting Bank must calculate E or EAD, 
whichever is applicable, as the notional amount of the underlying reference credit exposure 
for which the Reporting Bank is providing protection adjusted for any payments received 
from or made to the protection buyer and recognised in the profit and loss account of the 
Reporting Bank. Where a Reporting Bank has provided unfunded credit protection via a 
credit default swap, the Reporting Bank must calculate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, 
as the notional amount of the underlying reference credit exposure for which the Reporting 
Bank is providing protection. 
 
 
 
205  
An example is the existence of a ceiling on the potential lending amount which is related to an obligor’s 
reported cash flow. 
206  
Examples of revolving loans include credit card exposures, home equity lines of credit, commercial lines of 
credit, and other lines of credit.

Sub-division 4:  Recognition of Eligible Financial Collateral for On-balance Sheet 
Assets and Off-balance Sheet Items Other than Exposures in 
Equity Investments in Funds, Securitisation Exposures, and CCR 
Exposures  
 
7.2.20 
A Reporting Bank which has taken eligible financial collateral for any transaction 
other than an exposure in equity investments in funds, a securitisation exposure, or a CCR 
exposure, may recognise the effect of such collateral in accordance with paragraphs 7.2.21 
to 7.2.26.   
 
7.2.21 
A Reporting Bank that does not use the IRBA may use either the FC(SA) or the 
FC(CA) to recognise the effect of eligible financial collateral. The Reporting Bank must 
apply the chosen approach consistently to the entire banking book and must not use a 
combination of both approaches. A Reporting Bank using the IRBA must not use the FC(SA).   
 
7.2.22 
A Reporting Bank using the SA(CR) and the FC(SA) may recognise the effect of 
eligible financial collateral in accordance with Sub-division 4 of Division 3 of this Part. 
Paragraphs 7.2.23 to 7.2.26 do not apply where a Reporting Bank uses the FC(SA). 
 
7.2.23 
A Reporting Bank using the SA(CR) and the FC(CA) may calculate E*, the 
SA(CR) exposure adjusted for eligible financial collateral, in accordance with Annex 7J and 
substitute E* for E when calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for that 
SA(CR) exposure under Sub-division 3 of Division 1 of this Part.   
 
7.2.24 
A Reporting Bank using the F-IRBA may calculate LGD* for IRBA exposures in 
accordance with paragraphs 7.4.75 to 7.4.79 to recognise the effect of eligible financial 
collateral.  
 
7.2.25 
A Reporting Bank using the supervisory slotting criteria and the FC(CA) may 
calculate EAD*, the IRBA exposure adjusted for eligible financial collateral, in accordance 
with Annex 7J and substitute EAD* for EAD when calculating the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount and EL amount for that IRBA exposure under Sub-division 4 of Division 
1 and Sub-division 14 of Division 4 of this Part, respectively. A Reporting Bank may apply 
this treatment only if the CRM of the eligible financial collateral has not been taken into 
consideration in assigning the exposure to internal obligor grades as set out in paragraph 
7.4.124.  
   
7.2.26 
A Reporting Bank using the A-IRBA or the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class 
may take collateral into account when deriving its own estimates of LGD.  
 
 
Sub-division 5:  Recognition of Eligible Financial Collateral for Securitisation 
Exposures 
 
7.2.27 
A Reporting Bank which has taken eligible financial collateral for a securitisation 
exposure may recognise the effect of such collateral used to hedge the credit risk of a 
securitisation exposure, in accordance with paragraphs 7.2.28 to 7.2.30. A Reporting Bank 
may recognise collateral pledged by an SPE.  
 
7.2.28 
A Reporting Bank that does not use the IRBA, the SEC-IRBA and the SEC-IAA 
may use either the FC(SA) or the FC(CA) to recognise the effect of eligible financial 
collateral. The Reporting Bank must apply the chosen approach consistently to the entire 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-18  
banking book and must not use a combination of both approaches. A Reporting Bank using 
the IRBA, SEC-IRBA, or SEC-IAA must not use the FC(SA).  
 
7.2.29 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-ERBA or SEC-SA and the FC(SA) may recognise 
the effect of eligible financial collateral in accordance with Sub-division 13 of Division 6 of 
this Part. Paragraph 7.2.30 does not apply to a Reporting Bank using the FC(SA).   
 
7.2.30  
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-IRBA, SEC-ERBA, SEC-IAA or SEC-SA and the 
FC(CA) may calculate E*, the SEC-IRBA, SEC-ERBA, SEC-IAA or SEC-SA exposure 
adjusted for eligible financial collateral, in accordance with Annex 7J and substitute E* for 
E when calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for that SEC-IRBA,  
SEC-ERBA, SEC-IAA or SEC-SA exposure under Sub-division 7 of Division 1 of this Part.   
 
 
Sub-division 6: Measurement of E or EAD for Pre-settlement Counterparty 
Exposures Arising from OTC Derivative Transactions, Exchange-
traded 
Derivative 
Transactions 
and 
Long 
Settlement 
Transactions, Other than Transactions Covered by a Qualifying 
Cross-Product Netting Agreement 
 
7.2.31 
Subject to paragraph 7.2.32, for each OTC derivative transaction, exchange-
traded derivative transaction or long settlement transaction which is not covered by a 
qualifying cross-product netting agreement, a Reporting Bank must calculate E or EAD, 
whichever is applicable, for the pre-settlement counterparty exposure arising from that 
OTC derivative transaction, exchange-traded derivative transaction or long settlement 
transaction using one of the following methods: 
 
(a) 
the SA-CCR set out in Annex 7D;  
 
(b) 
the CCR internal models method set out in Annex 7E.  
 
7.2.32 
For each counterparty, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the E or EAD, 
whichever is applicable, for each OTC derivative transaction calculated in accordance with 
paragraph 7.2.31, is the greater of zero and the difference between the sum of E or EAD, 
whichever is applicable, across all netting sets with the counterparty and the CVA loss. 
The Reporting Bank must calculate the CVA loss without taking into account any offsetting 
debit valuation adjustments which have been deducted in the calculation of CET1 Capital 
in accordance with paragraph 6.1.5(h). For the purposes of calculating the CVA risk capital 
requirement in Division 5 of Part VIII, a Reporting Bank must not reduce EAD by CVA 
losses. Where a Reporting Bank uses a combination of the SA-CCR and CCR internal 
models method to calculate its E or EAD, whichever is applicable, to a single counterparty, 
the Reporting Bank must allocate separately (with no double-counting) collateral posted 
by the counterparty, for the purposes of calculating its E or EAD, whichever is applicable, 
under each of the respective methods. 
 
7.2.33 
A Reporting Bank must not use the CCR internal models method unless it has 
received the approval of the Authority to do so. 
 
7.2.34 
Regardless of the method used by a Reporting Bank for calculating E or EAD, 
whichever is applicable, for the pre-settlement counterparty exposure arising from OTC 
derivative transactions, exchange-traded derivative transactions and SFTs, a Reporting 
Bank may determine E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for the pre-settlement 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-19  
counterparty exposure arising from long settlement transactions using either of the 
methods set out in paragraph 7.2.31. 
 
7.2.35 
To avoid doubt, in calculating E for a securitisation exposure which arises from 
a derivative transaction other than a credit risk derivative transaction, a Reporting Bank 
must calculate E in accordance with this Sub-division.  
 
 
Sub-division 7:  Measurement of E or EAD for Pre-Settlement Counterparty 
Exposures Arising from SFTs, Other than Transactions Covered 
by a Qualifying Cross-Product Netting Agreement 
 
7.2.36 
A Reporting Bank must treat an SFT as a collateralised transaction for the 
purposes of this Notice, despite the wide range of structures which could be used for SFTs.  
 
7.2.37 
A Reporting Bank must calculate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for a pre-
settlement counterparty exposure arising from an SFT, other than an exposure covered 
by a qualifying cross-product netting agreement – 
 
(a) 
in accordance with paragraphs 7.2.41 to 7.2.47; or 
 
(b) 
using the CCR internal models method set out in Annex 7E. 
 
7.2.38  
A Reporting Bank must not use the CCR internal models method unless it has 
received the approval of the Authority to do so.  
 
7.2.39 
A Reporting Bank on either side of an SFT must hold capital for the SFT.207  
 
7.2.40 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must calculate the E or EAD, as the case may 
be, of the on-balance sheet leg of an SFT under Sub-division 2 of this Division. 
 
7.2.41 
Unless a Reporting Bank is using the CCR internal models method and subject 
to paragraph 7.2.42, it must determine E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for a pre-
settlement counterparty exposure arising from an SFT which is not covered by a qualifying 
cross-product netting agreement as follows: 
  
(a) 
in the case where the Reporting Bank has lent collateral to a counterparty 
or sold collateral to a counterparty with a commitment to repurchase those 
collateral at a specified price on a specified future date, the latest fair 
value of the collateral lent or sold;  
 
(b) 
in the case where the Reporting Bank has lent cash to a counterparty 
through the borrowing of collateral from the counterparty or paid cash for 
the purchase of collateral from a counterparty with a commitment to resell 
those collateral at a specified price on a specified future date, the amount 
of cash lent or paid. 
 
7.2.42 
Despite paragraph 7.2.41(a), where a Reporting Bank is using the FC(CA) for 
the recognition of eligible financial collateral, for SFTs where a Reporting Bank has lent or 
 
207  
For example, a Reporting Bank must hold capital for repos and reverse repos, securities lending and 
securities borrowing transactions. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-20  
sold non-eligible financial collateral to a counterparty, a Reporting Bank must determine 
E* or EAD* in accordance with Annex 7J, and substitute E* for E and EAD* for EAD when 
calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for that SA(CR) exposure or IRBA 
exposure under Sub-division 5 of Division 1 of this Part.  
 
7.2.43 
A Reporting Bank which has taken eligible financial collateral for any SFT where 
the pre-settlement counterparty exposure is determined in accordance with paragraph 
7.2.41 may recognise the effect of such collateral in accordance with paragraphs 7.2.44 
to 7.2.47. 
 
7.2.44 
A Reporting Bank that does not use the IRBA may use either the FC(SA) or the 
FC(CA) to recognise the effect of eligible financial collateral for any SFT. The Reporting 
Bank must apply the chosen approach consistently to the entire banking book and must 
not use a combination of both approaches. A Reporting Bank using the IRBA must not use 
the FC(SA) to recognise the effect of eligible financial collateral for any SFT. 
 
7.2.45 
A Reporting Bank using the SA(CR) and FC(SA) may recognise the effect of 
eligible financial collateral for any SFT in accordance with Sub-division 4 of Division 3 of 
this Part. Paragraphs 7.2.46 to 7.2.52 do not apply where a Reporting Bank uses the 
FC(SA). 
 
7.2.46 
A Reporting Bank which has taken eligible financial collateral for any SFT that 
is not covered by a qualifying bilateral netting agreement, or which has taken eligible 
financial collateral for any SFT that is covered by a qualifying bilateral netting agreement 
but for which the Reporting Bank has elected not to recognise the netting effects for the 
purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements, may – 
 
(a) 
if it is using the SA(CR) and the FC(CA), calculate E*, the SA(CR) exposure 
adjusted for eligible financial collateral, in accordance with Annex 7J, and 
substitute E* for E when calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure 
amount for that SA(CR) exposure under Sub-division 5 of Division 1 of this 
Part; and  
 
(b) 
if it is using the IRBA (whether F-IRBA, A-IRBA or IRBA for the IRBA retail 
asset class), calculate EAD* in accordance with Annex 7J (if the Reporting 
Bank is using the FC(CA)) or Annex 7F (if the Reporting Bank is using VaR 
models), and substitute EAD* for EAD when calculating the credit risk-
weighted exposure amount for that IRBA exposure under Sub-division 5 
of Division 1 of this Part.  
 
7.2.47 
A Reporting Bank which has taken eligible financial collateral for an SFT that is 
covered by a qualifying bilateral netting agreement may – 
 
(a) 
if it is using the SA(CR) and the FC(CA), calculate E*, the SA(CR) exposure 
adjusted for eligible financial collateral for all its SA(CR) exposures to any 
single counterparty covered by the qualifying bilateral netting agreement, 
in accordance with Annex 7J, and substitute E* for E when calculating the 
credit risk-weighted exposure amount for its SA(CR) exposures to that 
counterparty under Sub-division 5 of Division 1 of this Part; and 
 
(b) 
if it is using the IRBA (whether F-IRBA, A-IRBA or IRBA for the IRBA retail 
asset class), calculate EAD*, the IRBA exposure adjusted for eligible 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-21  
financial collateral for all its IRBA exposures to any single counterparty 
covered by the qualifying bilateral netting agreement, in accordance with 
Annex 7J (if the Reporting Bank is using the FC(CA)), or Annex 7F (if the 
Reporting Bank is using VaR models), and substitute EAD* for EAD when 
calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for its IRBA 
exposures to that counterparty under Sub-division 5 of Division 1 of this 
Part. 
 
7.2.48 
Where a Reporting Bank, acting as an agent of a party (the “third party”), 
arranges a repo-style transaction, a commodities lending transaction or a commodities 
borrowing transaction between a counterparty and a third party and provides a guarantee 
to the counterparty that the third party will perform on its obligations, the risk to the 
Reporting Bank is the same as if the Reporting Bank had entered into the transaction as a 
principal. In such circumstances, the Reporting Bank must calculate capital requirements 
as if it were itself the principal to the repo-style transaction, a commodities lending 
transaction or a commodities borrowing transaction. 
 
 
Sub-division 8:  Measurement of E or EAD for Pre-Settlement Counterparty 
Exposures Arising from OTC Derivative Transactions, Long 
Settlement Transactions and SFTs Covered by a Qualifying Cross-
Product Netting Agreement 
 
7.2.49 
Subject to paragraph 7.2.50, a Reporting Bank must calculate E or EAD, 
whichever is applicable, for any pre-settlement counterparty exposure arising from any 
OTC derivative transaction, long settlement transaction or SFT to a single counterparty 
that is covered by a qualifying cross-product netting agreement, using the CCR internal 
models method set out in Annex 7E. 
  
7.2.50 
For each counterparty, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the E or EAD, 
whichever is applicable, for each OTC derivative transaction calculated in accordance with 
paragraph 7.2.49, is the greater of zero and the difference between the sum of E or EAD, 
whichever is applicable, across all netting sets with the counterparty and the CVA loss. 
The Reporting Bank must calculate the CVA loss without taking into account any offsetting 
debit valuation adjustments which have been deducted in the calculation of CET1 Capital 
in accordance with paragraph 6.1.5(h). For the purposes of calculating the CVA risk capital 
requirement in Division 5 of Part VIII, a Reporting Bank must not reduce EAD by CVA 
losses. 
 
7.2.51 
A Reporting Bank must not use the CCR internal models method unless it has 
received the approval of the Authority to do so.  
 
 
Sub-division 9: Exceptions to the Measurement of E or EAD  
 
7.2.52 
Despite paragraphs 7.2.1 to 7.2.51, a Reporting Bank may attribute a value of 
zero to E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for –  
 
(a) 
any pre-settlement counterparty exposure arising from any credit 
derivative which a Reporting Bank may recognise as eligible credit 
protection for a banking book exposure or another CCR exposure; and 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-22  
(b) 
any pre-settlement counterparty exposure arising from any sold credit 
default swap in the banking book, where the credit default swap is treated 
as credit protection sold by the Reporting Bank, and subject to credit risk 
capital requirements for the full notional amount.  
 
7.2.53 
For the purposes of calculating the CVA risk capital requirement in Division 5 of 
Part VIII, the Reporting Bank must not attribute a value of zero to E or EAD, whichever is 
applicable, for the pre-settlement counterparty exposure to the protection provider, arising 
from a credit derivative which the Reporting Bank recognises as an eligible hedge, in the 
calculation of the CVA risk capital requirement.

Division 3:  SA(CR) 
 
Sub-division 1: Categorisation of SA(CR) Exposures 
 
7.3.1 
A Reporting Bank must categorise any SA(CR) exposure into one of the 
following asset classes and where applicable, one of the following asset sub-classes, under 
SA(CR): 
 
(a) 
cash items, which consist of – 
 
(i) 
cash and cash equivalents, including cheques, drafts and other items 
drawn on other banks, merchant banks or finance companies that 
are either payable immediately upon presentation or that are in the 
process of collection; and

backed by gold bullion liabilities;  
 
(b) 
central government and central bank asset class, which consists of any

such a securities firm or financial institution is classified and risk-
weighted as a bank under the regulatory capital requirements for 
banks in that foreign country or jurisdiction, unless a published, 
international assessment 208, as notified by the Authority to the 
Reporting Bank, has identified that the class of securities firms or 
financial institutions to which such a securities firm or financial 
institution belongs, is not subject to prudential standards and 
supervision equivalent to those applied to banks,

(B) the obligor has few or no other material assets or activities and 
therefore little or no independent capacity to repay the 
obligation, apart from the income that it receives from the 
assets being financed; 
 
(C) for the purposes of sub-paragraph (g)(iii)(B), the primary 
source of repayment of the obligation is the income generated 
by the assets, rather than the independent capacity of the 
broader commercial enterprise of the obligor;  
 
(D) the terms of the obligation give the Reporting Bank a 
substantial degree of control over the assets and the income 
that such assets generate; 
 
(h) 
equity and subordinated debt asset class, which consists of any exposure 
which is – 
 
(i) 
a subordinated debt as defined in paragraph 7.3.8;

and such regulatory retail asset class consists of the following asset sub-
classes:

regulatory retail asset class to an obligor in relation to revolving 
loans including credit cards and charge cards where the billed 
balance has been repaid in full at or before each scheduled

7-26  
repayment date for the previous 12 months, or in relation to

regulatory real estate asset sub-class, which consists of any 
exposure in the real estate asset class meeting all the conditions in

Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-27  
(iv) a right-of-use asset where the Reporting Bank is a lessee and the 
underlying asset is a tangible asset.  
 
7.3.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.1(f), an eligible covered bond refers to a 
covered bond that meets all of the following conditions at the issuance date of the covered 
bond and throughout its remaining maturity:  
 
(a) 
the cover pool of the covered bond consists of assets that constitute –   
 
(i)  
exposures which would fall within the asset classes in paragraph 
7.3.1(b), (c) or (d), or are guaranteed by the entities referred to in 
those paragraphs; 
 
(ii) 
regulatory RRE exposures which would fall within the regulatory real 
estate asset sub-class in paragraph 7.3.1(k)(ii) with a loan-to-value 
ratio (“LTV”) of 80% or lower;  
 
(iii) regulatory CRE exposures which would fall within the regulatory real 
estate asset sub-class in paragraph 7.3.1(k)(ii) with an LTV of 60% 
or lower; or  
 
(iv) exposures which would fall within the bank asset class in paragraph 
7.3.1(e), or are guaranteed by entities referred to in paragraph 
7.3.1(e), and which would qualify for a 30% or lower risk weight 
under paragraphs 7.3.52 to 7.3.63, provided that such exposures do 
not in aggregate exceed 15% of the relevant covered bond issuance;  
 
 
(b) 
the nominal value of the cover pool assigned to the covered bond by its 
issuer exceeds the nominal outstanding value of the covered bond 
issuance (“over-collateralisation requirement”) by at least 10%210, and for 
the purposes of meeting this over-collateralisation requirement of at least 
10% –  
 
(i) 
where the relevant legislative framework governing the issuance of 
such covered bonds does not stipulate an over-collateralisation 
requirement of at least 10%, the Reporting Bank must ensure that 
the issuer of the covered bond publicly discloses on a regular basis 
that the cover pool meets the over-collateralisation requirement of 
10% at all times; and  
 
(ii) 
in addition to the primary assets set out in sub-paragraph (a), the 
assets used to meet this over-collateralisation requirement may 
include substitution assets that are cash or short-term liquid and 
high quality assets held in substitution of the primary assets to top 
up the cover pool for management purposes, and derivatives entered 
into for the purposes of hedging the risks arising in the covered bond 
programme;  
 
 
 
210  
For this purpose, the value of the cover pool does not need to be that required by the relevant legislative 
framework governing the issuance of such covered bonds. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-28  
(c) 
the Reporting Bank can demonstrate to the Authority that –  
 
(i) 
it receives portfolio information at least on –  
 
(A) the value of the cover pool and outstanding covered bonds; 
 
(B) the geographical distribution and type of assets in the cover 
pool, loan size, interest rate and currency risks; 
 
(C) the maturity structure of assets in the cover pool and covered 
bonds; and 
 
(D) the percentage of loans more than 90 days past due; and 
 
(ii) 
the issuer has made, or has undertaken to make, the information 
referred to in sub-paragraph (c)(i) available to the Reporting Bank 
at least semi-annually. 
 
7.3.3 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must categorise an exposure to a securities 
firm or other financial institution which does not fall within paragraph 7.3.1(e)(v) under 
the corporate asset class in paragraph 7.3.1(g). 
 
7.3.4 
For the purposes of determining whether a corporation, partnership, limited 
liability partnership, sole proprietorship, trust, or fund ("business”) has a reported annual 
revenue of less than or equal to S$100 million, and therefore whether an SA(CR) exposure 
to such a business is to be categorised under the corporate SME asset sub-class, the 
Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
if the business is part of a group of companies as defined in section 209A 
of the Companies Act 1967, use the reported annual consolidated revenue 
of the group of companies; 
 
(b)  have in place rigorous information gathering and timely updating 
processes to ensure that the reported annual revenue figure used is timely 
and relevant;   
 
(c)  use an audited reported annual revenue figure, but where a business is 
established in a country or jurisdiction where the legislation governing the 
preparation of the business’s financial statements does not require audited 
financial statements to be maintained, the Reporting Bank may use 
unaudited accounts to ascertain the reported annual revenue figure; 
 
(d)  subject unaudited accounts used to ascertain the reported annual revenue 
figures under sub-paragraph (c) to an internal or external independent 
verification conducted on an annual basis;  
 
(e)  use a reported annual revenue figure taken from the most recent full-year 
financial statements, which must be for a financial period ending not more 
than 21 months before the time when the credit risk-weighted exposure 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-29  
amount for that SA(CR) exposure is calculated, unless paragraph 7.3.5 
applies211; and 
 
(f) 
not categorise an exposure under the corporate SME asset sub-class if it 
becomes aware of any event after the date of the financial statements 
referred to in sub-paragraph (e) that would reasonably cause an 
adjustment of the reported annual revenue of the business such that it is 
more than S$100 million. 
 
7.3.5 
Despite paragraph 7.3.4(e), where subsequent to the Reporting Bank’s initial 
categorisation of an SA(CR) exposure into the corporate SME asset sub-class, a Reporting 
Bank is unable to obtain updated financial statements of the business, the Reporting Bank 
may use a reported annual revenue figure taken from full-year financial statements which 
are for a financial period ending more than 21 months before the time when the credit 
risk-weighted exposure amount for that SA(CR) exposure is calculated. In such a case, 
the Reporting Bank may continue to categorise such an exposure under the corporate SME 
asset sub-class, but must risk-weight the exposure in accordance with paragraphs 7.3.67 
to 7.3.70. 
 
7.3.6 
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.3.1(g), 7.3.1(h) and 7.3.4, “fund” includes 
any collective investment scheme or closed-end fund. 
 
7.3.7 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.1(g)(iii)(A), –   
 
(a) 
“Project finance” refers to the method of funding in which the Reporting 
Bank looks primarily to the revenues generated by a single project, both 
as a source of repayment and as security for the exposure. This type of 
financing is usually for large, complex and expensive installations 212. 
Project finance may take the form of financing of the construction of a new 
capital installation, or refinancing of an existing installation, with or 
without improvements; 
  
(b) 
“Object finance” refers to the method of funding the acquisition of physical 
assets213 where the repayment of the exposure is dependent on the cash 
flows generated by the specific assets that have been financed and 
pledged or assigned to the Reporting Bank; and 
 
(c) 
“Commodities finance” refers to structured short-term lending to finance 
reserves, inventories, or receivables of exchange-traded commodities214, 
where the exposure will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the 
commodity and the obligor has no independent capacity to repay the 
exposure.  
 
7.3.8 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.1(h), “subordinated debt” means any liability 
or debt instrument that is subordinated to general creditors of the entity, and includes any 
 
211  
For example, a Reporting Bank must not use the reported annual revenue figure for the 12 months ending 
31 December 2022 for calculating credit risk-weighted exposure amounts after 30 September 2024. 
212  
For example, power plants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment 
infrastructure, or media and telecommunications infrastructure. 
213  
For example, ships, aircraft, satellites, railcars, or fleets. 
214  
For example, crude oil, metals or crops. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-30  
liability that meets the definition of “other TLAC liabilities” in paragraphs 6.3.14 and 6.3.15, 
provided that such liability or debt instrument does not fall within the scope of equity 
exposures as set out in paragraphs 7.3.9 and 7.3.10.  
 
7.3.9 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.1(h), “equity exposure” refers to any 
exposure that meets all of the following requirements:  
 
(a)  the instrument is irredeemable and the return of invested funds can be 
achieved only by the sale of the investment or sale of the rights to the 
investment or by the liquidation of the issuer of the instrument; 
 
(b)  the instrument does not in substance amount to an obligation on the part 
of the issuer of the instrument; 
 
(c)  the instrument conveys a residual claim on the assets or income of the 
issuer of the instrument. 
 
7.3.10 
A Reporting Bank must include all of the following as equity exposures: 
 
(a) 
any direct or indirect ownership interests, whether voting or non-voting, 
in the assets or income of a bank, corporation, partnership, limited liability 
partnership, sole proprietorship, trust, fund or any type of business vehicle, 
where indirect ownership interests include holdings of derivative 
instruments tied to equity interests and holdings in a bank, corporation, 
partnership, limited liability partnership, sole proprietorship, trust, fund or 
any type of business vehicle that issues ownership interests and is 
engaged principally in the business of investing in equity instruments; 
 
(b)  any instrument with the same structure as one approved for inclusion as 
Tier 1 Capital under Part VI or equivalent regulatory requirements of a 
bank regulatory agency other than the Authority; 
 
(c)  any instrument that in substance amounts to an obligation on the part of 
the issuer of the instrument and where one or more of the following 
conditions are satisfied: 
 
(i) 
the issuer may defer the settlement of the obligation indefinitely; 
 
(ii) 
the obligation requires, or permits at the discretion of the issuer, 
settlement by issuance of a fixed number of the equity shares of the 
issuer;  
 
(iii) the obligation requires, or permits at the discretion of the issuer, 
settlement by issuance of a variable number of the equity shares of 
the issuer and ceteris paribus, any change in the value of the 
obligation is attributable to, comparable to, and in the same direction 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-31  
as, the change in the value of a fixed number of the equity shares of 
the issuer215; 
 
(iv) the instrument is an instrument where the holder has the option to 
require that the obligation be settled in equity shares, but does not 
include any of the following instruments:  
 
(A) a traded instrument where the Reporting Bank is able to 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that the 
instrument is traded more like the debt of the issuer than its 
equity;  
 
(B) a non-traded instrument where the Reporting Bank is able to 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that the 
instrument should be treated as a debt exposure;  
 
(d)  any instrument, including any debt, security, partnership, derivative or 
vehicle, structured with the intent of conveying the economic substance 
of an ownership interest exposure as defined in sub-paragraph (a). This 
includes – 
 
(i) 
any debt instrument which is convertible into equity at the option of 
the issuer or automatically by the terms of the instruments;  
 
(ii) 
any equity that is recorded as a loan, arising from a debt to equity 
swap made as part of the orderly realisation or restructuring of the 
debt, where such instrument does not attract a lower regulatory 
capital requirement than would apply if the holding remained in the 
debt portfolio; and 
 
(iii) any instrument with a return linked to that of equities, unless it is 
directly hedged by another equity exposure and the net position does 
not involve material risk;  
 
(e) 
any perpetual instrument which is irredeemable or redeemable at the 
issuer’s option, including any irredeemable perpetual preference shares or 
perpetual preference shares redeemable at the issuer’s option; 
 
(f)  any debt holding where the Authority has, on a case-by-case basis, 
required the Reporting Bank to recharacterise as an equity exposure for 
the purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements.  
 
 
215  
For certain obligations that require or permit settlement by issuance of a variable number of the issuer’s 
equity shares, the change in the monetary value of the obligation is equal to the change in the fair value 
of a fixed number of equity shares multiplied by a specified factor. Those obligations meet the conditions 
of paragraph 7.3.10(c)(iii) if both the factor and the referenced number of shares are fixed. For example, 
an issuer may be required to settle an obligation by issuing shares with a value equal to 3 times the 
appreciation in the fair value of 1,000 equity shares. That obligation is considered to be the same as an 
obligation that requires settlement by issuance of shares equal to the appreciation in the fair value of 3,000 
equity shares. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-32  
7.3.11 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.10(d)(iii), a Reporting Bank must, if required 
by the Authority, be able to demonstrate that the net position of hedged equity exposures 
does not involve material risk. 
 
7.3.12 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.10(d), the Reporting Bank must not include 
any instrument structured with the intent of conveying the economic substance of a debt 
holding or securitisation exposure.216  
 
7.3.13 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.10(c)(iv)(A) and (B), subject to approval by 
the Authority, a Reporting Bank may break down the risks associated with the instrument 
into an equity exposure and a debt exposure for the purposes of calculating regulatory 
capital requirements under the Notice. The Reporting Bank must, if required by the 
Authority, be able to demonstrate how it breaks down the risks into an equity exposure 
and a debt exposure.  
 
7.3.14 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.1(h), “regulatory capital instrument” refers 
to an instrument which is included in the regulatory capital of a financial institution that is 
subject to minimum prudential standards by a financial regulatory agency.  
 
7.3.15 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.1(i), in the case of an exposure to a small 
business, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the exposure also qualifies as a retail small 
business exposure in accordance with the internal written policies of the Reporting Bank.  
 
7.3.16 
For the purposes of determining the total exposure to any obligor or group of 
obligors in paragraph 7.3.1(i)(iii) and (iv), the Reporting Bank must ensure that the total 
exposure is gross of any CRM and comprises all exposures to that obligor or group of 
obligors under paragraph 7.3.1(i) and (j). For off-balance sheet exposures, the Reporting 
Bank must ensure the exposure is gross of any CRM and calculated after applying the 
relevant CCFs. In addition, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the basis of aggregation, 
is the same basis on which the Reporting Bank treats an obligor in a group of obligors for 
its risk management purposes, and must include exposures to related corporations of the 
obligor and exposures to the sole proprietors or partners in any of the entities in the group 
of obligors. However, the Reporting Bank may disaggregate its exposures to an obligor in 
a group of obligors if it has assessed that the disaggregated obligor has sufficient financial 
resources to fully service the obligor’s liabilities and does not need to depend on any other 
entity within the group of obligors for financial assistance in meeting the liabilities. A 
Reporting Bank must not disaggregate based on product type alone.  
 
7.3.17 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.1(k)(ii), a Reporting Bank must categorise 
an SA(CR) exposure in the real estate asset class, under the regulatory real estate asset 
sub-class, if all of the following conditions are met:   
 
(a) 
the exposure is –  
 
(i)  
secured by a fully completed real estate;   
 
(ii) 
to an individual and secured by RRE under construction or land upon 
which RRE would be constructed in Singapore, where the RRE is – 
 
 
216  
For example, a Reporting Bank must treat perpetual preference shares redeemable at the holder’s option 
and non-convertible term preference shares as debt exposures.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-33  
(A) an HDB flat, Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flat, or 
Executive Condominium (EC);   
 
(B) RRE constructed by a licensed housing developer as defined in 
section 2 of the Housing Developers (Control & Licensing) Act 
1965, and licensed under Part II of the Housing Developers 
(Control & Licensing) Act 1965; or  
 
(C) RRE that will be the primary residence of the obligor, with 4 or 
fewer units, and is not, in effect, indirectly financing ADC; or  
 
(iii) to an individual and secured by RRE under construction or land upon 
which RRE would be constructed in a foreign country or jurisdiction 
and all of the following conditions are met: 
  
(A) the bank regulatory agency in the foreign country or jurisdiction 
allows the SA(CR) exposure in the real estate asset class to an 
individual and secured by RRE under construction or land upon 
which RRE would be constructed in the foreign country or 
jurisdiction to be subject to the same capital treatment as an 
exposure secured by a fully completed real estate;   
 
(B) the Reporting Bank has assessed and ascertained that – 
 
(I) 
the sovereign or a PSE in the foreign country or 
jurisdiction has the legal powers and ability to ensure that 
the RRE under construction will be completed; or  
 
(II) the SA(CR) exposure in the real estate asset class meets 
the condition in sub-paragraph (a)(ii)(C);   
 
(C) the Reporting Bank has informed the Authority in writing of the 
assessment in sub-paragraph (a)(iii)(B), prior to categorising 
the exposure in the regulatory real estate asset sub-class, 
unless the Authority has directed that the Reporting Bank must 
seek prior approval for any such categorisations. To avoid 
doubt, the Authority may disallow the categorisation if the 
Authority is not satisfied with the assessment in sub-paragraph 
(a)(iii)(B);   
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must obtain a written independent legal opinion217, 
which concludes that any claim on the real estate securing the exposures 
is binding on all relevant parties and legally enforceable in all relevant 
countries or jurisdictions, including the country or jurisdiction whose law 
governs the collateral agreement and the country or jurisdiction whose 
law governs the transaction in relation to the collateral agreement;  
 
 
217  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal counsel, a Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel is independent of the parties originating the exposure. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-34  
(c) 
the collateral agreement mentioned in sub-paragraph (b) and the legal 
process underpinning it provides for the Reporting Bank to realise the 
value of the property within a reasonable time frame;  
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank holds –      
 
(i) 
a first charge over the real estate;   
 
(ii) 
a junior charge over the real estate where all the senior charges 
ranking above the junior charge in question are held by one or more 
of the following persons: 
  
(A)  the Reporting Bank;  
 
(B)  CPF; 
 
(C)  HDB; or  
 
(iii) a junior charge over the real estate where another person or persons 
hold any senior charges, or a junior charge and senior charge over 
the real estate, with another person or persons holding an 
intermediate charge, where the junior charge provides the Reporting 
Bank a claim for the real estate that is legally enforceable and 
constitutes an effective mitigant for credit risk, and all of the 
following conditions are met:     
 
(A) the Reporting Bank is able to initiate the sale of the real estate 
independently from other persons holding a charge over the 
real estate;  
 
(B) in cases where the real estate is not sold by means of a public 
auction, persons holding the senior charge over the real estate 
are required to take reasonable steps to obtain a fair market

circumstances when exercising any power of sale on their own; 
 
 (C) for the purposes of sub-paragraph (d)(iii)(B), persons holding 
the senior charge to the real estate are not allowed to sell the 
real estate on their own at a discounted value in detriment of 
the junior charge;  
 
(e) 
the obligor must meet the criteria set out in the Reporting Bank’s 
underwriting policies for granting exposures secured by real estate, 
including the assessment of the ability of the obligor to repay;  
 
(f) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that its underwriting policies –    
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-35  
(i)  
define relevant metrics, including the debt service coverage ratio, 
and specify the corresponding relevant levels for the Reporting 
Bank’s assessments;218 and  
 
(ii)  define additional relevant metrics, including occupancy rate of the 
real estate, where the repayment of the exposure depends materially 
on the cash flows generated by the real estate;   
 
(g) 
the Reporting Bank must calculate the LTV of the exposure as the amount 
of the loan divided by the value of the real estate, in accordance with all 
of the following:   
 
(i)  
the value of the real estate must be based on a valuation that 
satisfies all of the following conditions: 
 
(A) the valuation is appraised independently from the Reporting 
Bank’s mortgage acquisition, loan processing and loan decision 
process;  
 
(B) the valuation criteria is prudently conservative, and excludes 
expectations on price increases and reflects the value that is 
sustainable over the life of the exposure, taking into account 
the potential for the current market price to be significantly 
above this value;  
 
(C) the valuation is not higher than the market value of the real 
estate where the market value can be determined or the 
effective purchase price of the real estate where the exposure 
is financing the purchase of the real estate;  
 
(ii) 
the value of the real estate must be maintained at the valuation 
referred to in sub-paragraph (g)(i) measured at origination of the 
exposure, subject to all of the following:     
 
(A) where the value of the real estate has declined since origination, 
including where there is an impairment to the value of the real 
estate, the Reporting Bank must apply the lower value; 
 
(B) the Reporting Bank may make a upward adjustment to the 
value of the real estate, subsequent to an adjustment in sub-
paragraph (g)(ii)(A), in accordance with an increase in the 
value of the real estate, provided that the value of the real 
estate does not exceed the valuation measured at origination;  
 
(C) where the value of the real estate has unequivocally increased 
due to modifications made to the real estate, based on a 
subsequent formal valuation of the real estate by an 
 
218  
The Reporting Bank should refer to Notice 645 on “Computations of Total Debt Servicing Ratio for Property 
Loans” and Notice 632 on “Residential Property Loans” published by the Authority and “Principles for sound 
residential mortgage underwriting practices” (April 2012) issued by the FSB for the setting of the 
appropriate metrics and levels. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-36  
independent accredited valuer, the Reporting Bank may apply 
the higher value;  
 
(iii) the amount of loan must include the outstanding amount and any 
undrawn committed amount of the exposure, and be calculated gross 
of any specific or general allowances and before the application of 
CRM, subject to all of the following:     
 
(A) a Reporting Bank may net pledged deposits from the amount 
of the loan in accordance with paragraphs 7.2.9 and 7.2.10 
where the loans and deposits are covered by a qualifying 
on-balance sheet netting agreement, and the deposits are 
pledged unconditionally and irrevocably for the sole purpose of 
redemption of the exposure;      
 
(B) in the case where a Reporting Bank has different exposures 
secured by the same real estate and the charges for these 
exposures are sequential in ranking order i.e. no intermediate 
charge from another person, the Reporting Bank must treat the 
different exposures as a single exposure for risk-weighting 
purposes and calculate the amount of the loan for the LTV 
computation by aggregating the amount of the loans of the 
different exposures; 
 
(C) in the case where the Reporting Bank holds a junior charge over 
the real estate and another person or persons hold any senior 
charges pursuant to sub-paragraphs (d)(ii) and (d)(iii), the 
Reporting Bank must calculate the amount of loan for the LTV 
computation for the exposure secured by the junior charge in 
question as the aggregate of the amount of loan of the 
exposure secured by the junior charge in question and the 
amount of loans secured by other charges of equal or higher 
ranking than the junior charge in question, including senior 
charges held by CPF, or HDB, or both;      
 
(h) 
the value of the real estate must not depend materially on the 
performance of the obligor;  
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that all the information required at the 
origination of the exposure and for monitoring purposes is properly 
documented, including information on the ability of the obligor to repay in 
sub-paragraph (e) and on the valuation of the property in sub-paragraph 
(g).   
 
7.3.18 
For the purposes of the condition in paragraph 7.3.17(a)(i), the Reporting Bank 
must treat forest and agricultural land as fully completed. 
 
7.3.19 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.17(a)(ii)(C), the Reporting Bank must assess 
whether the RRE is the primary residence of the obligor at the inception of the exposure 
and update the assessment when the Reporting Bank becomes aware of any relevant 
information. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-37  
7.3.20 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.17(a)(ii) and (iii), a Reporting Bank may 
treat an exposure to an entity other than an individual, as an exposure to the individual, 
if the Reporting Bank meets all the following conditions: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank has robust processes to ascertain that the exposure is 
structured to replicate the risk profile of an exposure to an individual;  
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank is able to identify and manage the legal risks that arise 
in such structures;  
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank ensures that the exposure is covered by a personal 
guarantee which is –  
 
(i)  
provided by an individual who ultimately owns or controls the entity 
or an individual on whose behalf the exposure is established; and  
 
(ii)  meets the requirements in paragraph 4.1 of Annex 7H;  
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Authority that the conditions in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are met, 
when requested to do so by the Authority. 
 
7.3.21 
For the purposes of the valuation referred to in paragraph 7.3.17(g)(i), a 
Reporting Bank must obtain a formal valuation by an independent accredited valuer at 
origination. For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.17(g), a Reporting Bank must assess the 
value of the real estate at least on an annual basis. The Reporting Bank must have in place 
policies addressing matters in relation to the value of the real estate in paragraph 
7.3.17(g)(i) and (ii), including the frequency of revaluation, the procedures for revaluation 
under various market circumstances, and the revaluation methods and approaches to be 
used in each circumstance which may include statistical methods219 or a formal revaluation 
by an independent accredited valuer.220 A Reporting Bank must obtain a formal revaluation 
by an independent accredited valuer on the valuation of the real estate if the Reporting 
Bank assesses that the value of the real estate may have declined materially relative to 
general market prices or when a credit event221 occurs.  
 
7.3.22 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.17(g)(iii)(C), if there is insufficient 
information to ascertain the ranking of the other charges, the Reporting Bank must assume 
that the other charges rank pari passu with the junior charge held by the Reporting Bank. 
 
 
Sub-division 2:  Credit Quality Grades and External Credit Assessments 
 
7.3.23 
A Reporting Bank must assign an SA(CR) exposure to a credit quality grade 
based on the external credit assessment that is applicable to the SA(CR) exposure in 
accordance with Tables 7M-1 and 7M-2, as the case may be. 
 
 
219  
For example, reference to property indices or sampling. 
220  
A Reporting Bank should regularly backtest and benchmark statistical methods, where possible, so that the 
results obtained are robust. A Reporting Bank may also use statistical methods to identify real estate that 
may have declined in value and that may need revaluation. In general, a Reporting Bank should undertake 
a formal revaluation regularly. 
221  
For example, default. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-38  
7.3.24  
A Reporting Bank must only use external credit assessments by recognised 
ECAIs. The Authority may impose conditions on the use of such external credit 
assessments.  
 
7.3.25  
A Reporting Bank must not consider an SA(CR) exposure as being rated from 
the perspective of the Reporting Bank unless the exposure has an external credit 
assessment by a recognised ECAI and the Reporting Bank has notified the Authority of its 
nomination to use the external credit assessments of that recognised ECAI for regulatory 
capital purposes. In other words, if an external credit assessment by an ECAI exists but –  
 
(a) 
the ECAI is not a recognised ECAI; or 
 
(b) 
the ECAI is a recognised ECAI that has not been nominated by the 
Reporting Bank, 
 
the Reporting Bank must consider the exposure as being unrated from the perspective of 
the Reporting Bank. 
 
7.3.26  
Subject to paragraph 7.3.27, a Reporting Bank must perform due diligence to – 
 
(a) 
ensure that the Reporting Bank has an adequate understanding, at 
origination and thereafter on a regular basis at least annually, of the risk 
profile and characteristics of its counterparties; and  
 
(b) 
in cases where external credit assessments are used, assess the risk of 
the exposure for risk management purposes and whether the risk weight 
applied is appropriate and prudent.222  
 
7.3.27  
A Reporting Bank must assess the operating and financial performance levels 
and trends, through internal credit analysis or other analytics outsourced to a third party, 
for each counterparty. A Reporting Bank must be able to access information about its 
counterparties on a regular basis to complete due diligence analyses.223 A Reporting Bank 
must be able to demonstrate to the Authority that its due diligence analyses are 
appropriate.224  
 
7.3.28 
Paragraphs 7.3.26 and 7.3.27 do not apply to SA(CR) exposures in the central 
government and central bank asset class, and PSE asset class. 
 
7.3.29 
A Reporting Bank must use its nominated recognised ECAIs and their external 
credit assessments consistently for each type of exposure, for both risk-weighting and risk 
management purposes. A Reporting Bank must not cherry-pick the assessments provided 
by different recognised ECAIs or arbitrarily change its choice of recognised ECAIs for each 
type of exposure.  
 
 
222  
The sophistication of the due diligence should be appropriate to the size and complexity of the Reporting 
Bank’s activities.  
223  
For SA(CR) exposures to entities belonging to consolidated groups, a Reporting Bank should perform due 
diligence, to the extent possible, at the legal entity level to which there is a SA(CR) exposure. In evaluating 
the repayment capacity of the legal entity, a Reporting Bank should take into account the support of the 
group and the potential for it to be adversely impacted by problems in the group. 
224  
A Reporting Bank should have in place effective internal policies, processes, systems and controls to ensure 
that the appropriate risk weights are assigned to counterparties. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-39  
7.3.30 
For a particular SA(CR) exposure – 
 
(a) 
if there is only one external credit assessment by a recognised ECAI that 
has been nominated by the Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank must use 
that assessment to determine the risk weight of the SA(CR) exposure; 
 
(b) 
if there are 2 external credit assessments by recognised ECAIs that have 
been nominated by the Reporting Bank, and the assessments map into 
different credit quality grades, the Reporting Bank must assign the SA(CR) 
exposure to the credit quality grade associated with the higher risk weight; 
or 
 
(c) 
if there are 3 or more external credit assessments by recognised ECAIs 
that have been nominated by the Reporting Bank, and the assessments 
map into different credit quality grades, the Reporting Bank must use only 
the 2 assessments that correspond to the lowest risk weights, and –  
 
(i) 
if the 2 credit assessments map into the same credit quality grade, 
the Reporting Bank must use that credit assessment to determine 
the risk weight of the SA(CR) exposure; and  
 
(ii) 
if the 2 credit assessments map into different credit quality grades, 
the Reporting Bank must assign the SA(CR) exposure to the credit 
quality grade associated with the higher risk weight. 
 
7.3.31  
A Reporting Bank must not recognise the effects of CRM if such CRM is already 
reflected in the issue-specific external credit assessment of the SA(CR) exposure.    
 
7.3.32  
Where an SA(CR) exposure has an issue-specific external credit assessment by 
a recognised ECAI that has been nominated by the Reporting Bank, a Reporting Bank must 
use such assessment to determine the risk weight of the SA(CR) exposure. Where an 
SA(CR) exposure does not have an issue-specific external credit assessment by a 
recognised ECAI that has been nominated by the Reporting Bank – 
 
(a) 
if there is an issue-specific external credit assessment by a recognised 
ECAI that has been nominated by the Reporting Bank for another exposure 
to the same obligor which maps to a risk weight that is lower than that 
applicable to an unrated exposure, a Reporting Bank may use that issue-
specific assessment to risk-weight the SA(CR) exposure only if the SA(CR) 
exposure ranks pari passu with or is senior to the exposure with the issue-
specific assessment in all respects;  
 
(b) 
if the obligor has an issuer external credit assessment by a recognised 
ECAI that has been nominated by the Reporting Bank which maps to a risk 
weight that is lower than that applicable to an unrated exposure – 
 
(i) 
if the SA(CR) exposure is a senior claim, a Reporting Bank may use 
the issuer assessment of the obligor to risk-weight the SA(CR) 
exposure; and 
 
(ii) 
if the SA(CR) exposure is not a senior claim, the Reporting Bank 
must apply the risk weight that is applicable to an unrated exposure;  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-40  
 
(c) 
if there is an issue-specific external credit assessment by a recognised 
ECAI that has been nominated by the Reporting Bank for another exposure 
to the same obligor which maps to a risk weight that is equal to or higher 
than that applicable to an unrated exposure, a Reporting Bank must use 
that issue-specific assessment to risk-weight the SA(CR) exposure if the 
SA(CR) exposure ranks pari passu with or is subordinated to the exposure 
with the issue-specific assessment; 
 
(d) 
if the obligor has an issuer external credit assessment by a recognised 
ECAI that has been nominated by the Reporting Bank which maps to a risk 
weight that is equal to or higher than that applicable to an unrated 
exposure, a Reporting Bank must use the issuer assessment of the obligor 
to risk-weight the SA(CR) exposure if the SA(CR) exposure ranks pari 
passu with or is subordinated to the highest unsecured claim on the obligor;   
 
(e) 
if the obligor has an issuer external credit assessment by a recognised 
ECAI that has been nominated by the Reporting Bank which maps to a risk 
weight that is lower than that applicable to an unrated exposure, and 
which only applies to a limited class of liabilities, a Reporting Bank may 
use the issuer assessment of the obligor only if the exposure falls within 
that class; or  
 
(f) 
in all other cases, a Reporting Bank must apply the risk weight that is 
applicable to an unrated exposure. 
 
7.3.33 
A Reporting Bank must not use a short-term issue-specific external credit 
assessment to derive risk weights for other short-term claims to the same obligor, except 
where set out in paragraphs 7.3.54, 7.3.55, 7.3.56, 7.3.68, 7.3.69, 7.3.72 and 7.3.73. In 
all cases, a Reporting Bank must not use a short-term issue-specific external credit 
assessment to support a risk weight for an unrated long-term claim.  
 
7.3.34  
A Reporting Bank must not use external credit assessments for an obligor within 
a group to risk-weight other obligors within the same group.  
 
7.3.35 
Where an SA(CR) exposure is risk-weighted in accordance with paragraph 
7.3.32(a) to (e), a Reporting Bank must use a foreign currency external credit assessment 
for an SA(CR) exposure denominated in foreign currency. A Reporting Bank may use a 
domestic currency external credit assessment, if separate, only if –  
 
(a) 
the SA(CR) exposure is denominated in that domestic currency; or  
 
(b) 
the SA(CR) exposure arises through a Reporting Bank’s participation in a 
loan that has been extended, or is guaranteed against convertibility and 
transfer risk, by a qualifying MDB, in which case the domestic currency 
external credit assessment may be used instead of its foreign currency 
external credit assessment. Where the SA(CR) exposure is guaranteed 
against convertibility and transfer risk by a qualifying MDB, the domestic 
currency external credit assessment may be used only for the portion of 
the SA(CR) exposure that is covered by such a guarantee. For the portion 
of the SA(CR) exposure that is not covered by such a guarantee, a 
Reporting Bank must use the foreign currency external credit assessment.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-41  
7.3.36 
A Reporting Bank may use an external credit assessment to risk-weight an 
SA(CR) exposure only if the external credit assessment has taken into account and reflects 
the entire amount of credit risk exposure the Reporting Bank has with regard to all 
payments owed to it.225  
 
7.3.37 
A Reporting Bank must not use unsolicited external credit assessments to assign 
any SA(CR) exposure to a credit quality grade, unless – 
 
(a) 
it has assessed the quality of the unsolicited external credit assessments 
that it intends to use and is satisfied that these are comparable in 
performance with solicited external credit assessments and maintains 
relevant records and documents to be made available to the Authority 
upon request; and 
 
(b) 
it uses unsolicited external credit assessments consistently for each type 
of exposures, for both risk-weighting and risk management purposes. 
 
7.3.38 
The Authority may exclude the use of unsolicited external credit assessments 
by a recognised ECAI for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements if the 
Authority is not satisfied that the unsolicited assessments are not inferior in quality to the 
general quality of solicited assessments. In the event the Authority is of the view that an 
ECAI uses unsolicited external credit assessments to put pressure on entities to obtain 
solicited external credit assessments, the Authority may refuse to recognise such ECAIs 
as eligible for capital adequacy purposes.   
 
Sub-division 3: Risk Weights 
 
7.3.39 
Subject to Sub-division 4 of this Division, a Reporting Bank using the SA(CR) 
must226 – 
 
(a) 
for an SA(CR) exposure that is not defaulted, determine the applicable risk 
weight in accordance with paragraphs 7.3.40 to 7.3.108; and 
 
(b) 
for an SA(CR) exposure that is defaulted, determine the applicable risk 
weight in accordance with paragraphs 7.3.109 to 7.3.111. 
 
 
 
Cash Items 
 
7.3.40 
Subject to paragraph 7.3.41, a Reporting Bank must apply a 0% risk weight to 
any SA(CR) exposure categorised as a cash item. 
 
7.3.41 
A Reporting Bank must apply a 20% risk weight to cash equivalents, including 
cheques, drafts and other items drawn on other banks, merchant banks or finance 
 
225  
For example, if a Reporting Bank is owed both principal and interest, the Reporting Bank must ensure that 
the assessment fully takes into account and reflects the credit risk associated with repayment of both 
principal and interest. 
226 
This includes an SA(CR) exposure to a lessee equivalent to the discounted lease payment and an SA(CR) 
exposure to the residual value of the leased assets equivalent to the estimate of the residual value reflected 
in the balance sheet of the Reporting Bank, as calculated in accordance with paragraph 7.2.7.

process of collection.  
 
 
 
Central Government and Central Bank Asset Class 
 
7.3.42 
Subject to paragraphs 7.3.43 to 7.3.46, a Reporting Bank must risk-weight any

funded by liabilities denominated in Singapore dollars. 
 
7.3.44 
For any SA(CR) exposure to any other central government or central bank which 
is denominated and funded by liabilities denominated in the local currency of that country 
or jurisdiction, a Reporting Bank may apply such risk weights as may be specified by the 
bank regulatory agency of that country or jurisdiction. 
 
7.3.45 
To avoid doubt, where applicable, a Reporting Bank may apply the risk weights 
specified in paragraphs 7.3.43 and 7.3.44 as the risk weight applicable to the eligible 
protection provider or eligible financial collateral pursuant to Sub-division 4 of this Division.  
 
7.3.46 
A Reporting Bank must apply a 0% risk weight to any SA(CR) exposure to the 
Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central 
Bank, the European Union, the European Stability Mechanism or the European Financial 
Stability Facility.   
 
 
 
PSE Asset Class 
 
7.3.47 
Subject to paragraph 7.3.48, a Reporting Bank must risk-weight any SA(CR) 
exposure in the PSE asset class in accordance with Table 7-2.

in accordance with Table 7-3 if – 
 
(a)  in the case of a PSE in Singapore, the exposure to the PSE is treated as 
an exposure to the Singapore Government and the Singapore Government 
has a credit quality grade of “1” or “2” as set out in Table 7M-1; and 
 
(b) 
in the case of a PSE outside Singapore, the bank regulatory agency of the 
country or jurisdiction where the PSE is established has exercised the 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-43  
national discretion to treat the exposure to the PSE as an exposure to the 
central government and the central government of the country or 
jurisdiction of that PSE has a credit quality grade of “1” or “2” as set out 
in Table 7M-1.

Subject to paragraphs 7.3.54 to 7.3.57, for any rated SA(CR) exposure in the 
bank asset class, a Reporting Bank must apply the risk weight determined in accordance 
with Table 7-5. Short-term exposures in Table 7-5 refer to either of the following:  
 
(a)  exposures with an original maturity of 3 months or less; 
 
(b)  exposures that arise from the movement of goods across national borders 
with an original maturity of 6 months or less227. 
 
 
 
227  
This may include on-balance sheet exposures such as loans and off-balance sheet exposures such as self-
liquidating trade-related contingent items.

For the purposes of risk-weighting under paragraph 7.3.52, a Reporting Bank 
may use external credit assessments that incorporate assumptions of implicit government 
support up to 31 December 2028, unless the Authority requires otherwise. With effect 
from 1 January 2029, a Reporting Bank must not use external credit assessments that 
incorporate assumptions of implicit government support, unless the external credit 
assessments refer to a public bank owned by its government. Where an external credit 
assessment which does not incorporate assumptions of implicit government support is 
unavailable, a Reporting Bank must risk-weight the SA(CR) exposure as an exposure that 
does not have an external credit assessment by a recognised ECAI under paragraph 7.3.58. 
For the purposes of this paragraph, implicit government support refers to the notion that 
the government would act to prevent bank creditors from incurring losses in the event of 
a bank default or bank distress. 
 
7.3.54 
A Reporting Bank must risk-weight any short-term SA(CR) exposure228 in the 
bank asset class with an issue-specific external credit assessment by a recognised ECAI, 
in accordance with Table 7-6.

(a) 
attracts a risk weight of 50% or 100%, then the Reporting Bank must 
apply a risk weight of not lower than 100% to any unrated short-term 
SA(CR) exposure to the same entity; or 
 
(b) 
attracts a risk weight of 150%, then the Reporting Bank must apply a risk 
weight of 150% to any unrated SA(CR) exposure (whether long-term or 
short-term) to the same entity, unless the Reporting Bank uses recognised 
CRM for such exposure. 
 
7.3.56 
A Reporting Bank must comply with all of the following requirements when 
determining whether to apply the general preferential treatment for short-term exposures 
in the bank asset class as described in paragraph 7.3.52, or the treatment for issue-specific 
short-term external credit assessments as set out in paragraph 7.3.54: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must apply the general preferential treatment for 
short-term exposures to all exposures in the bank asset class of up to 3 
 
228  
An example of a short term SA(CR) exposure is a particular issuance of commercial paper.

months original maturity when there is no issue-specific short-term 
external credit assessment for any short-term exposure to the obligor; 
 
(b) 
if there is an issue-specific short-term external credit assessment for a 
short-term exposure to the obligor which maps to a risk weight that is 
lower or identical to that derived from the general preferential treatment, 
the Reporting Bank must use the issue-specific short-term external credit 
assessment for only that specific short-term exposure and apply the 
general preferential treatment to other short-term exposures to the same 
obligor;  
 
(c) 
if there is an issue-specific short-term external credit assessment for a 
short-term exposure to the obligor which maps to a higher risk weight 
than that derived from the general preferential treatment, the Reporting 
Bank must not use the general short-term preferential treatment. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that all unrated short-term exposures receive 
the same risk-weighting as that implied by the issue-specific short-term 
external credit assessment. 
 
7.3.57 
A Reporting Bank must perform due diligence to ensure that any external credit 
assessment by a recognised ECAI appropriately and conservatively reflects the 
creditworthiness of the SA(CR) exposure in the bank asset class. If the due diligence 
analysis reflects higher risk characteristics than that implied by the credit quality grade of 
the exposure, the Reporting Bank must assign a risk weight corresponding to at least one 
credit quality grade higher than that determined in accordance with Table 7-5 or  
Table 7-6, as the case may be. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the due diligence 
analysis does not result in the application of a lower risk weight than that determined in 
accordance with Table 7-5 or Table 7-6, as the case may be. 
 
7.3.58 
Subject to paragraph 7.3.59, for any SA(CR) exposure in the bank asset class 
that does not have an external credit assessment by a recognised ECAI, a Reporting Bank 
must classify the exposure into one of the 3 assessment grades in accordance with 
paragraph 7.3.60 and apply the risk weight determined in accordance with Table 7-7. 
Short-term exposures in Table 7-7 refer to either of the following:  
 
(a)  exposures with an original maturity of 3 months or less;  
 
(b)  exposures that arise from the movement of goods across national borders 
with an original maturity of 6 months or less229.

A classification, provided that, based on the latest available information –  
 
(a) 
the counterparty has a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio which meets or 
exceeds 14%; and 
 
(b) 
the counterparty has a Tier 1 leverage ratio which meets or exceeds 5%. 
 
7.3.60 
A Reporting Bank must classify an SA(CR) exposure in the bank asset class that 
does not have an external credit assessment by a recognised ECAI into one of the 3 
assessment grades, based on the following criteria:  
 
(a) 
Grade A  
 
(i) 
Grade A refers to exposures to counterparties with adequate capacity 
to meet their financial commitments (including repayments of 
principal and interest) in a timely manner, for the projected life of 
the assets or exposures, and irrespective of economic cycles and 
business conditions. 
 
(ii) 
Subject to paragraph 7.3.61, a Reporting Bank must classify a 
counterparty into Grade A where the counterparty meets or exceeds 
the published minimum regulatory requirements and buffers 
established by its national regulatory agency as implemented in the 
country or jurisdiction where it is incorporated, except for entity-
specific minimum regulatory requirements or buffers that may be 
imposed through supervisory actions and are not made public230. If 
such minimum regulatory requirements and buffers (other than 
entity-specific minimum requirements or buffers) are not publicly 
disclosed or otherwise made available to the Reporting Bank, the 
Reporting Bank must classify the counterparty as Grade B or  
Grade C. For the purposes of this paragraph, published minimum 
regulatory requirements exclude liquidity standards. 
 
(b) 
Grade B 
 
(i) 
Grade B refers to exposures to counterparties which are subject to 
substantial 
credit 
risk, 
including 
exposures 
for 
which 
the 
counterparty’s repayment capacity is dependent on stable or 
favourable economic or business conditions. 
 
(ii) 
A Reporting Bank must classify a counterparty into Grade B where 
the counterparty meets or exceeds the published minimum 
regulatory requirements (excluding buffers) established by its 
national regulatory agency as implemented in the country or 
jurisdiction where it is incorporated, except for entity-specific 
minimum regulatory requirements or buffers that may be imposed 
through supervisory actions and are not made public 231. If such 
minimum regulatory requirements are not publicly disclosed or

otherwise made available to the Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank 
must classify the counterparty as Grade C. For the purposes of this 
paragraph, published minimum regulatory requirements exclude 
liquidity standards. 
 
(c) 
Grade C 
 
(i) 
Grade C refers to higher credit risk exposures to counterparties with 
material default risks and limited margins of safety, and for which 
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions are very likely to 
lead, or have led, to an inability to meet their financial commitments. 
 
(ii) 
At a minimum, if any of the following conditions are met, a Reporting 
Bank must classify the exposure as Grade C: 
 
(A) the counterparty does not meet the published minimum 
regulatory requirements as set out in sub-paragraph (b)(ii);  
 
(B) where in compliance with the legislation governing the 
preparation of the counterparty’s financial statements, in the 
country or jurisdiction in which the counterparty is established, 
the counterparty has prepared audited financial statements and 
the external auditor has issued an adverse audit opinion or has 
expressed doubt about the counterparty’s ability to continue as 
a going concern in its financial statements or audited reports 
within the previous 12 months. 
 
(iii) In 
all 
other 
cases 
where 
none 
of 
the 
conditions 
in  
sub-paragraph (c)(ii) is met, a Reporting Bank must classify an 
exposure to a counterparty as Grade C where the Reporting Bank 
assesses that the counterparty meets the criteria in sub-paragraph 
(c)(i). 
 
7.3.61 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.60, if, as part of its due diligence, a Reporting 
Bank assesses that the counterparty does not meet the definition of Grade A in paragraph 
7.3.60(a), the Reporting Bank must classify the exposure as Grade B, unless it meets the 
criteria for Grade C in paragraph 7.3.60(c).  
 
7.3.62 
Subject to paragraph 7.3.63, for any SA(CR) exposure in the bank asset class 
that does not have an external credit assessment by a recognised ECAI, a Reporting Bank 
must apply the risk weight determined in accordance with Table 7-7 or the risk weight that 
is applicable to an SA(CR) exposure to the central government of the country or jurisdiction 
in which the counterparty is incorporated, whichever is higher, where all of the following 
conditions are met: 
 
(a) 
the SA(CR) exposure is not denominated in the local currency of the 
country or jurisdiction in which the counterparty is incorporated;  
 
(b) 
if the SA(CR) exposure is booked in a branch of the counterparty which is 
located in a country or jurisdiction other than the country or jurisdiction 
in which the counterparty is incorporated, the SA(CR) exposure is not 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-48  
denominated in the local currency of the country or jurisdiction where the 
branch is located. 
 
7.3.63 
Paragraph 7.3.62 does not apply to self-liquidating trade-related contingent 
items that arise from the movement of goods with an original maturity of below one year. 
 
 
Covered Bond Asset Class 
 
7.3.64 
A Reporting Bank must risk-weight any SA(CR) exposure in the covered bond 
asset class that has an issue-specific external credit assessment by a recognised ECAI in 
accordance with Table 7-8.

creditworthiness of the covered bond and the issuing bank or mortgage institution. If the 
due diligence analysis reflects higher risk characteristics than that implied by the credit 
quality grade of the exposure, the Reporting Bank must assign a risk weight corresponding 
to at least one credit quality grade higher than that determined in accordance with  
Table 7-8 or Table 7-9, as the case may be. A Reporting Bank must ensure that due 
diligence analysis does not result in the application of a lower risk weight than that 
determined in accordance with Table 7-8 or Table 7-9, as the case may be. 
 
 
 
Corporate Asset Class 
 
General Corporate Asset Sub-Class 
 
7.3.67

apply a risk weight of not lower than 100% to any unrated short-term 
SA(CR) exposure to the same corporate entity; or 
 
(b) 
attracts a risk weight of 150%, then the Reporting Bank must apply a risk 
weight of 150% to any unrated SA(CR) exposure (whether long-term or 
short-term) to the same entity, unless the Reporting Bank recognises CRM 
for such exposure. 
 
7.3.70 
A Reporting Bank must perform due diligence to ensure that any external credit 
assessment by a recognised ECAI appropriately and conservatively reflects the 
creditworthiness of the SA(CR) exposure in the general corporate asset sub-class. If the 
due diligence analysis reflects higher risk characteristics than that implied by the credit 
quality grade of the exposure, the Reporting Bank must assign a risk weight corresponding 
to at least one credit quality grade higher than that determined in accordance with Table 
7-10 or Table 7-11, as the case may be. A Reporting Bank must ensure that due diligence 
analysis does not result in the application of a lower risk weight than that determined in 
accordance with Table 7-10 or Table 7-11, as the case may be. 
 
 
 
Corporate SME Asset Sub-Class 
 
7.3.71 
Subject to paragraphs 7.3.72 and 7.3.73, a Reporting Bank must risk-weight

a positive net cash flow that is sufficient to cover any remaining 
contractual obligation; and   
 
(ii) 
declining long-term debt; and  
 
(b)  high quality project finance exposure refers to a project finance exposure 
in which the entity that was created specifically to finance or operate 
physical assets or both meets all of the following conditions:  
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank assesses that the entity is able to meet its 
financial commitments in a timely manner and that the entity’s 
ability to do so is robust against adverse changes in the economic 
cycle and business conditions;  
 
(ii) the entity is restricted from acting to the detriment of the creditors232;  
 
(iii) the entity has 
sufficient reserve funds or other financial 
arrangements to cover the contingency funding and working capital 
requirements of the project;  
 
(iv) the entity’s revenues are availability-based or subject to a rate-of-
return regulation or take-or-pay contract;  
 
(v) 
the entity’s revenue depends on one main counterparty, where an 
exposure to the main counterparty –  
 
(A) is categorised by the Reporting Bank under, or if the main 
counterparty were an obligor of the Reporting Bank, would be 
categorised by the Reporting Bank under – 
 
(I)  the central government and central bank asset class and 
is an exposure to a central government;

of a default of the entity;  
 
(vii) the Reporting Bank is protected from the losses resulting from the 
termination of the project by the main counterparty or at least one 
counterparty, under contractual provisions governing the exposure 
to the entity, where an exposure to the counterparty –

(viii) all assets and contracts necessary to operate the project have been 
pledged to the Reporting Bank to the extent permitted by applicable 
law;  
 
(ix) the Reporting Bank may assume control of the project finance entity 
in case of its default.   
 
7.3.78 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.77(a)(ii), the Reporting Bank may consider 
the entity that was created specifically to finance or operate physical assets or both to 
have a declining long-term debt if there is an overall decline in the long-term debt between 
the start date of the project and the point of evaluation. For the purposes of this paragraph, 
long term debt refers to a debt with original maturity of one year or more.  
 
7.3.79

once construction is completed, the entity is entitled to payments from its 
contractual counterparties, as long as contract conditions are fulfilled; and  
 
(b) 
the payments referred to in sub-paragraph (a) are – 
 
(i) 
sized to cover operating and maintenance costs, debt service costs 
and equity returns as the project finance entity operates the project; 
and  
 
(ii) 
not subject to swings in demand233, and are adjusted typically only 
for lack of performance or lack of availability of the asset to the public.    
 
 
Equity and Subordinated Debt Asset Class 
 
7.3.80 
Subject to paragraphs 7.3.82 and 7.3.84, a Reporting Bank must risk-weight 
any SA(CR) exposure in the equity and subordinated debt asset class as follows:  
 
(a)  400% risk weight to speculative unlisted equity exposures as set out in 
paragraph 7.3.81;  
 
(b) 
250% risk weight to all other equity exposures;  
 
(c)  150% risk weight to subordinated debt and regulatory capital instruments 
which are not equities.  
 
7.3.81 
Speculative unlisted equity exposures refers to equity investments in unlisted 
companies that are –  
 
(a)  invested for short-term resale purposes; or 
 
(b)  venture capital or similar investments234, 
 
and excludes investments in unlisted equities of corporate clients with which the Reporting 
Bank has or intends to establish a long-term business relationship and debt-equity swaps 
for corporate restructuring purposes.  
 
7.3.82 
A Reporting Bank must apply a risk weight of 1250% to – 
 
(a)  all of the following: 
 
(i)  
the portion of an individual equity exposure held in an unconsolidated 
major stake company that is not a financial institution, which 
exceeds 15% of the Reporting Bank’s Eligible Total Capital;  
 
(ii) 
the portion of an individual subordinated debt held in an 
unconsolidated major stake company that is not a financial 
 
233 
For example, traffic levels.  
234  
Venture capital or similar investments are typically investments that are subject to price volatility and are 
acquired in anticipation of significant future gains.

institution, which exceeds 15% of the Reporting Bank’s Eligible Total 
Capital; and 
 
(b)  the portion of the sum of – 
 
(i) 
the aggregate of the Reporting Bank’s equity exposures held in 
unconsolidated major stake companies that are not financial 
institutions; and 
 
(ii) 
the aggregate of the Reporting Bank’s subordinated debt held in 
unconsolidated major stake companies that are not financial 
institutions;  
 
which exceeds 60% of the Reporting Bank’s Eligible Total Capital.  
 
7.3.83 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.82(b), a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
calculate – 
 
(i) 
for each individual equity exposure held in an unconsolidated major 
stake company that is not a financial institution, the portion of the 
exposure that does not exceed 15% of the Reporting Bank’s Eligible 
Total Capital; and 
 
(ii) 
for each individual subordinated debt held in an unconsolidated 
major stake company that is not a financial institution, the portion 
of the exposure that does not exceed 15% of the Reporting Bank’s 
Eligible Total Capital; 
 
(b) 
aggregate the amounts calculated in sub-paragraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii); 
 
(c) 
calculate the portion of the sum of the exposures in paragraph 7.3.82(b)(i) 
and (ii) which exceeds 60% of the Reporting Bank’s Eligible Total Capital; 
 
(d) 
calculate the ratio of the amount calculated in sub-paragraph (c) to the 
amount calculated in sub-paragraph (b); and 
 
(e) 
for each individual equity exposure held in an unconsolidated major stake 
company that is not a financial institution and each individual subordinated 
debt held in an unconsolidated major stake company that is not a financial 
institution, apply a risk weight of 1250% on each amount calculated in 
sub-paragraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii), multiplied by the ratio calculated in sub-
paragraph (d). 
 
7.3.84 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must apply the risk weights set out in 
paragraph 7.3.80 to an SA(CR) exposure in the equity and subordinated debt asset class 
that is not subject to a 1250% risk weight under paragraph 7.3.82.  
 
7.3.85 
A Reporting Bank must subject the risk weights set out in paragraph 7.3.80(a) 
and (b) to a phase-in arrangement from 1 July 2024, as set out in Table 7-16.

 ADC Asset Sub-Class 
 
7.3.88 
Subject to paragraph 7.3.89, a Reporting Bank must risk-weight any SA(CR) 
exposure in the ADC asset sub-class at 150%.  
 
7.3.89 
A Reporting Bank may risk-weight any SA(CR) exposure secured by RRE in the 
ADC asset sub-class at 100% if the SA(CR) exposure meets all of the following:  
 
(a) 
prudential underwriting standards in paragraph 7.3.17(f);  
  
(b) 
LTV of the exposure, calculated as the amount of the loan divided by the 
value of the real estate, is less than or equal to 80%, with the value of the 
real estate based on a valuation that is calculated in accordance with all 
of the following:  
 
(i) 
the valuation is based on the gross development value of the real 
estate development and the real estate development is appraised 
independently from the Reporting Bank’s mortgage acquisition, loan 
processing and loan decision process;  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-56  
(ii) 
the valuation criteria is prudently conservative, and excludes 
expectations on price increases and reflects the value that is 
sustainable over the life of the exposure, taking into account the 
potential for the current market price to be significantly above this 
value;   
 
(iii) the valuation is not higher than the market value of the real estate 
where the market value can be determined.  
 
7.3.90 
For the purposes of the valuation referred to in paragraph 7.3.89(b), a 
Reporting Bank must obtain a formal valuation by an independent accredited valuer at 
origination. For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.89(b), a Reporting Bank must assess the 
value of the real estate at least on an annual basis. The Reporting Bank must have in place 
policies addressing matters in relation to the value of the real estate in paragraph 
7.3.89(b), including the frequency of revaluation, the procedures for revaluation under 
various market circumstances, and the revaluation methods and approaches to be used in 
each circumstance which may include statistical methods235 or a formal revaluation by an 
independent accredited valuer.236 A Reporting Bank must obtain a formal revaluation by 
an independent accredited valuer on the valuation of the real estate if the Reporting Bank 
assesses that the value of the real estate may have declined materially relative to general 
market prices or when a credit event237 occurs. 
 
 
Regulatory Real Estate Asset Sub-Class238 
 
7.3.91 
Subject to paragraph 7.3.96, a Reporting Bank must risk-weight any regulatory 
RRE exposure which is classified by the Reporting Bank as not materially dependent on 
cash flows generated by the real estate pursuant to paragraphs 7.3.100 and 7.3.101, in 
accordance with Table 7-18.

accordance with Table 7-19.  
 
 
235  
For example, reference to property indices or sampling. 
236  
A Reporting Bank should regularly backtest and benchmark statistical methods, where possible, so that the 
results obtained are robust. A Reporting Bank may also use statistical methods to identify real estate that 
may have declined in value and that may need revaluation. In general, a Reporting Bank should undertake 
a formal revaluation regularly. 
237  
For example, default. 
238  
The Authority may from time to time specify a higher risk weight for a particular exposure or group of 
exposures, taking into account, among other things, the default experience and other factors such as 
market price stability.

weight of the regulatory real estate exposure against a junior charge corresponds to the 
lowest LTV bucket in Table 7-18, 7-19, 7-20 or 7-21. The Reporting Bank must subject 
the resulting risk weight after applying the multiplier of 1.25 to a cap based on the 
applicable risk weight of the regulatory real estate exposure assuming that the exposure 
is in the other real estate asset sub-class.  
 
7.3.97 
A Reporting Bank which has bought eligible credit protection or has taken 
eligible financial collateral for an SA(CR) exposure in the regulatory real estate asset sub-
class may recognise the effects of CRM. For the purposes of this paragraph, eligible credit 
protection includes a mortgage insurance which complies with the requirements for 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-58  
recognition of guarantees set out in Annex 7H. 239  For the unprotected portion or 
uncollateralised portion of the SA(CR) exposure, the Reporting Bank must apply the risk 
weight based on the LTV bucket prior to the application of the effects of CRM. 
 
 
Other Real Estate Asset Sub-Class 
 
7.3.98 
A Reporting Bank must apply the following risk weights to any SA(CR) exposure 
in the other real estate asset sub-class, which is classified by the Reporting Bank as not 
materially dependent on cash flows generated by the real estate pursuant to paragraph 
7.3.100: 
 
(a) 
in the case of an exposure to an individual or group of individuals, 75%; 
 
(b) 
in the case of an exposure to a small business, 85%; 
 
(c) 
in all other cases, the risk weight that is applicable to an unsecured 
exposure to the obligor.  
 
7.3.99 
A Reporting Bank must risk-weight any SA(CR) exposure in the other real estate 
asset sub-class which is classified by the Reporting Bank as materially dependent on cash 
flows generated by the real estate pursuant to paragraph 7.3.100 at 150%.    
 
 
Material Dependence Conditions 
 
7.3.100 
A Reporting Bank must classify an SA(CR) exposure in the regulatory real estate 
asset sub-class or the other real estate asset sub-class as being materially dependent on 
cash flows generated by the real estate, if the servicing of the exposure and the prospects 
for recovery in the event of default materially depend on the cash flows generated by the 
real estate securing the exposure rather than on the underlying capacity of the obligor to 
service the exposure from other sources. The primary source of these cash flows would 
generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the property.240,241 
 
7.3.101 
Despite paragraph 7.3.100, for an SA(CR) exposure in the regulatory real estate 
asset sub-class, a Reporting Bank must not classify the following types of exposures as 
materially dependent on cash flows generated by the real estate:     
 
(a) 
an exposure secured by a real estate that is owner-occupied and is the 
obligor’s primary residence;     
 
 
239  
Where mortgage insurance is used by the Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank should refer to the “Principles 
for sound residential mortgage underwriting practices” (April 2012) issued by the FSB. 
240  
It is expected that an exposure which is classified by the Reporting Bank as materially dependent on cash 
flows generated by the real estate would predominantly apply to an obligor where an unsecured exposure 
to the obligor is in the corporate asset class or to an SPE, but is not restricted to such exposures. 
241  
As an example, an exposure may be considered materially dependent on cash flows generated by the real 
estate if more than 50% of the income from the obligor used in the Reporting Bank’s assessment of the 
obligor’s ability to service the exposure is from cash flows generated by the real estate securing the 
exposure. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-59  
(b) 
an exposure, secured by non-owner occupied residential real estate, to an 
individual who has mortgaged 2 or less non-owner occupied residential 
real estate units to the Reporting Bank;       
 
(c) 
an exposure secured by RRE to – 
 
(i)  
associations of individuals; or  
 
(ii)  cooperatives of individuals,  
 
where such associations or cooperatives are regulated under national law 
and exist with the only purpose of granting its members the use of a 
primary residence in the real estate securing the exposure;  
 
(d) 
an exposure secured by RRE to – 
 
(i)  
public housing companies; or 
 
(ii) 
not-for-profit associations, 
 
regulated under national law, that exist to serve social purposes and to 
offer tenants long-term housing.     
 
7.3.102  For the purposes of assessing material dependence in paragraphs 7.3.100 and 
7.3.101, a Reporting Bank must perform the assessment at the time of the inception of 
the exposure. The Reporting Bank must review the assessment of material dependence, 
based on the most current and updated information, where available. 
 
7.3.103 
To avoid doubt, for the purposes of paragraph 7.3.101(a), a Reporting Bank 
must count only up to one owner-occupied residential real estate unit as the obligor’s 
primary residence. For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.101(b), a Reporting Bank must 
count any mortgages on other owner-occupied residential real estate units as mortgages 
on non-owner occupied residential real estate units.

Risk weight multiplier to certain exposures denominated in a currency that 
differs from the income currency 
 
7.3.107 
Subject to a maximum risk weight of 150%, a Reporting Bank must apply a 
multiplier of 1.5 times to the applicable risk weight of an exposure which fulfils all the 
following conditions242: 
 
(a)  the exposure is an exposure to an individual; 
 
(b)  the exposure is –   
 
(i) 
an exposure in the regulatory retail asset class that is risk-weighted 
in accordance with paragraph 7.3.86;  
 
(ii) 
an exposure in the other retail asset class that is risk-weighted in 
accordance with paragraph 7.3.87;   
 
(iii) a regulatory RRE exposure that is risk-weighted in accordance with –  
 
(A)  paragraph 7.3.91 or 7.3.92; 
 
(B)  paragraph 7.3.96, where applicable; and 
 
(C)  paragraph 7.3.97, where applicable; or 
 
(iv)  an exposure in the other real estate asset sub-class that is risk-
weighted in accordance with paragraph 7.3.98 or 7.3.99, and is 
secured by RRE; 
 
(c) 
the exposure is denominated in a currency that differs from the currency 
of the individual’s source of income243,244; 
 
(d)  the exposure is an unhedged exposure.  
 
7.3.108 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.107, an unhedged exposure means an 
exposure to an obligor that does not have natural or financial hedges that cover in 
 
242  
A margin facility for which the Reporting Bank has policies and procedures in place to ensure that all of the 
following are met, need not be considered as an exposure to which the Reporting Bank must apply the 
multiplier: 
(a) the total outstanding loan amount (including any accrued interest) is over-collateralised on an ongoing 
basis;  
(b) the collateral comprises predominantly traded financial instruments (including insurance policies which 
can be surrendered to, or collective investment schemes which can be redeemed with, a financial 
institution subject to minimum prudential standards and supervision by a financial regulatory agency);  
(c) the collateral is revalued and remargined daily;  
(d) the revaluation of collateral referred to in (c) includes the application of haircuts for currency mismatch 
between the exposure and collateral. 
243  
Where the Reporting Bank is aware that the individual relies on more than one source of income to pay for 
the loan instalments, and where one or more of the sources of income is denominated in a currency that 
differs from the loan currency, the Reporting Bank should consider this condition as fulfilled. 
244  
Where information on the currency of the individual’s source of income is not readily available and 
impractical to obtain, the Reporting Bank may use the currency of the individual’s country or jurisdiction of 
residence as a proxy for determining the currency of the individual’s source of income. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-61  
aggregate at least 90% of the repayment of the loan instalment against the foreign 
exchange risk resulting from the mismatch between the currency of the obligor’s income 
and currency of the exposure. A natural hedge exists where the obligor, in its normal 
operating procedures, receives foreign currency income that matches the currency of a 
given exposure245. A financial hedge refers to a legal contract between the obligor and a 
financial institution to hedge the exposure246.    
 
 
 
Defaulted Exposures 
 
7.3.109 
Subject to paragraphs 7.3.110 and 7.3.111, a Reporting Bank must risk-weight 
the uncollateralised or unprotected portion of any SA(CR) exposure that is a defaulted 
exposure in accordance with Table 7-22. A defaulted exposure refers to an exposure that 
is in default in accordance with the definition of default in Annex 7L.

Subject to paragraph 7.3.111, a Reporting Bank must apply a 100% risk weight 
to any regulatory RRE exposure or any SA(CR) exposure in the other real estate asset 
sub-class which is secured by RRE that is – 
 
 (a) 
classified by the Reporting Bank as not materially dependent on cash flows 
generated by the real estate; and  
 
 (b) a defaulted exposure.  
 
7.3.111 
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.3.109 and 7.3.110 , a Reporting Bank must 
calculate the uncollateralised or unprotected portion of any SA(CR) exposure that is a 
defaulted exposure as follows:  
 
(a) 
for a Reporting Bank using the FC(SA), 
 
Uncollateralised or unprotected portion = E – P – Cf  
 
where – 
 
(i) 
E  
=  E calculated in accordance with Division 2 of this Part; 
 
(ii) 
P  
=  notional amount of eligible credit protection received; and 
 
(iii) Cf  
=   fair value of eligible financial collateral received; 
 
 
245  
For example, remittances, rental incomes, or salaries. 
246  
For example, a forward contract with a financial institution. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-62  
(b) 
for a Reporting Bank using the FC(CA), 
 
Uncollateralised or unprotected portion = E*– P  
 
where – 
 
(i) 
E*    =   E* calculated in accordance with Division 2 of this Part; and 
 
(ii) 
P  
=   notional amount of eligible credit protection received. 
 
 
Sub-division 4:  Treatment of Credit Protection and Recognition of Eligible 
Financial Collateral 
 
 
Treatment of Eligible Credit Protection Bought 
 
7.3.112  A Reporting Bank which has bought eligible credit protection for an SA(CR) 
exposure from an eligible protection provider may recognise the effects of CRM of the 
eligible credit protection, where the risk weight of the eligible protection provider is lower 
than that of the obligor, as follows: 
 
(a) 
break down the SA(CR) exposure into – 
 
(i) 
a protected portion with E equal to the notional amount of the eligible 
credit protection, subject to any adjustments due to a currency 
mismatch or a maturity mismatch set out in Annex 7H; and 
 
(ii) 
an unprotected portion with E equal to the E of the SA(CR) exposure 
less the notional amount of the eligible credit protection adjusted for 
any currency mismatch or maturity mismatch set out in Annex 7H;  
 
(b) 
for the purposes of calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
pursuant to Sub-division 3 or 5 of Division 1 of this Part, use – 
 
(i) 
for the protected portion, the risk weight that is applicable to the 
eligible protection provider; and 
 
(ii) 
for the unprotected portion, the risk weight that is applicable to the 
obligor. 
 
7.3.113 
Despite paragraph 7.4.112(b), a Reporting Bank must apply a 1250% risk 
weight to an SA(CR) exposure below a materiality threshold for which no payment will be 
made by the protection provider in the event of loss on the SA(CR) exposure as such an 
exposure is equivalent to a retained first loss position.  
 
7.3.114 
A Reporting Bank must apply the relevant provisions in Annex 7I for the 
purposes of determining the protected portion in cases of proportional cover, principal-
only cover, partially eligible credit derivatives, tranched cover and basket credit derivatives.  
 
 
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-63  
 
Treatment of Credit Protection Sold 
 
7.3.115 
A Reporting Bank which has sold unfunded credit protection acquires exposure 
to the reference asset. If such exposure is an SA(CR) exposure, the Reporting Bank must 
calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the exposure using the risk weight 
that is applicable to the obligor of the reference asset. 
 
7.3.116 
If the unfunded credit protection has more than one reference asset, the credit 
risk-weighted exposure amount for the credit protection is the sum of the credit risk-
weighted exposure amounts in respect of each reference asset calculated using the risk 
weights that are applicable to the obligors of the respective reference assets.     
 
7.3.117 
A Reporting Bank which has sold funded credit protection acquires exposure to 
both the reference asset and the protection buyer. If such exposures are SA(CR) exposures, 
the Reporting Bank must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the credit 
protection as the sum of – 
 
(a) 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the exposure to the 
reference asset calculated in accordance with paragraphs 7.3.115 and 
7.3.116 , as applicable; and   
 
(b) 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the exposure to the 
protection buyer, using –  
 
(i) 
E = the carrying amount of the collateral placed with the protection 
buyer; and 
 
(ii) 
the risk weight that is applicable to the protection buyer.  
 
7.3.118 
The capital requirement for the credit protection calculated in accordance with 
paragraphs 7.3.116 and 7.3.117 must not exceed the notional amount of the credit 
protection i.e. the maximum possible payout under the credit protection.  
 
7.3.119 
Where a Reporting Bank has provided credit protection (whether funded or 
unfunded) through a proportionate structure, i.e. where the maximum possible payout in 
respect of any particular reference asset is capped at a pre-determined proportion of the 
notional amount of the credit protection, the Reporting Bank must divide the exposure into 
individual sub-exposures equal to the proportionate amount of credit protection in respect 
of each reference asset for the purposes of calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure 
amount applicable to the credit protection sold. 
 
7.3.120 
Where a Reporting Bank has provided credit protection for a basket of reference 
exposures through a first-to-default credit derivative, the Reporting Bank must calculate 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount applicable to the credit protection sold by 
aggregating the risk weights that would be assigned to the reference exposures, subject 
to a cap of 1250%, and multiplying the aggregate with the nominal amount of the 
protection provided by the credit derivative.  
 
7.3.121 
Where a Reporting Bank has provided credit protection for a basket of reference 
exposures through a nth-to-default credit derivative, the Reporting Bank must calculate 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount applicable to the credit protection sold by 
applying the treatment referred to in paragraph 7.3.120, except that in aggregating the 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-64  
risk weights, the risk weights assigned to the n-1 assets in the basket of reference 
exposures with the lowest credit risk-weighted exposure amounts may be excluded.  
 
 
 
Recognition of Eligible Financial Collateral under FC(SA) 
 
7.3.122 
A Reporting Bank which has taken eligible financial collateral must ensure that 
the eligible financial collateral is pledged for at least the life of the exposure, and must 
mark-to-market and revalue the eligible financial collateral at least on a 6-monthly basis, 
or more frequently if specified by the Authority, to recognise the effects of CRM of the 
eligible financial collateral under the FC(SA). Subject to paragraph 7.3.124, the Reporting 
Bank using the FC(SA) may recognise the effects of CRM of the eligible financial collateral 
as follows: 
 
(a) 
break down the SA(CR) exposure into – 
 
(i) 
a collateralised portion with E equal to the latest fair value of the 
eligible financial collateral; and 
 
(ii) 
an uncollateralised portion with E equal to the E of the SA(CR) 
exposure less the latest fair value of the eligible financial collateral;  
 
(b) 
for the purposes of calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
pursuant to Sub-division 3 or 5 of Division 1 of this Part, use – 
 
(i) 
for the collateralised portion, the risk weight that is applicable to the 
eligible financial collateral as though the Reporting Bank had a direct 
exposure to that collateral; and 
 
(ii) 
for the uncollateralised portion, the risk weight that is applicable to 
the obligor.  
 
7.3.123 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.3.122(b)(i), when cash on deposit, certificates 
of deposit or other similar instruments issued by the Reporting Bank –  
 
(a) 
are held in a non-custodial arrangement, as collateral at a third-party 
bank, merchant bank or finance company; and 
  
(b) 
are unconditionally and irrevocably pledged or assigned to the Reporting 
Bank as the lender, 
  
the Reporting Bank must apply the risk weight of the third-party bank, merchant bank or 
finance company, as the case may be, to the collateralised portion of the exposure covered 
by such collateral.  
 
7.3.124 
If the risk weight determined in accordance with paragraph 7.3.122(b)(i) is less 
than 20%, a Reporting Bank must apply a risk weight of 20% to the collateralised portion 
of the SA(CR) exposure, except in the following cases: 
 
(a) 
a qualifying repo-style transaction where the counterparty in the 
transaction is a core market participant, in which case the Reporting Bank 
may apply a risk weight of 0%; 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-65  
 
(b)  a qualifying repo-style transaction where the counterparty in the 
transaction is not a core market participant, in which case the Reporting 
Bank may apply a risk weight of 10%; 
 
(c) 
a transaction where there is no currency mismatch and the collateral 
comprises – 
 
(i) 
cash and certificates of deposit or other instruments similar to 
certificates of deposit issued by the Reporting Bank, but excluding 
structured deposits as defined under regulation 2 of the Financial 
Advisers (Structured Deposits – Prescribed Investment Product and 
Exemption) Regulations, as set out in paragraph 2.2(a) of Annex 7H; 
or 
 
(ii) 
exposures in the central government and central bank asset class or 
in the PSE asset class or a combination thereof qualifying for a 0% 
risk weight under the SA(CR), and the latest fair value of such 
collateral has been discounted by 20% for the purposes of 
determining the value of the collateralised portion of the SA(CR) 
exposure in accordance with paragraph 7.3.122(a)(i),  
 
in which case the Reporting Bank may apply a risk weight of 0%.  
 
 
Treatment of Pools of CRM 
 
7.3.125 
A Reporting Bank which is using multiple CRM to cover a single SA(CR) 
exposure247 must sub-divide the exposure into portions covered by each type of CRM248 
and calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount of each portion separately by 
applying paragraphs 7.3.112, 7.3.113, 7.3.114, 7.3.122 and 7.3.124, whichever is 
applicable. A Reporting Bank must apply the same approach when recognising eligible 
credit protection by a single eligible protection provider with differing maturities.  
 
 
Sub-division 5:  Recognised ECAIs 
 
 
Recognition of an ECAI 
 
7.3.126 
The Authority may recognise an ECAI if the Authority –  
 
 
(a) 
is satisfied that the ECAI meets the recognition criteria set out in 
paragraphs 7.3.130 to 7.3.138249, including for short-term external credit 
assessments where short-term external credit assessments are to be used; 
and 
 
247  
For example, the Reporting Bank has both eligible financial collateral and eligible credit protection partially 
covering the exposure. 
248  
For example, a portion covered by eligible financial collateral and a portion covered by eligible credit 
protection. 
249  
For this purpose, the Authority will consider, among others, the ECAI’s adherence to the “Code of Conduct 
Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies” issued by IOSCO (revised March 2015 and available at 
www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD482.pdf). 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

(b) 
has received a letter of support from a Reporting Bank stating that it 
intends to use the external credit assessments of that ECAI for the 
purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements pursuant to this 
Notice250. 
 
7.3.127 
The recognition of an ECAI by the Authority is for the sole purpose of calculating 
regulatory capital requirements by a Reporting Bank pursuant to this Notice, and must not 
be taken as regulation of the ECAI or licensing or approval of the ECAI to do business in 
Singapore. 
 
7.3.128 
The Authority may revoke its recognition of an ECAI if the ECAI no longer meets 
the criteria set out in paragraphs 7.3.130 to 7.3.138.  
 
7.3.129 
The list of recognised ECAIs is set out at Annex 7N. 
 
 
 
Recognition Criteria 
 
7.3.130 
Objectivity:  The methodology for assigning credit assessments of a recognised 
ECAI must be rigorous, systematic, and subject to validation based on historical experience. 
Credit assessments must be subject to ongoing review and responsive to changes in 
financial condition of the entity assessed. An assessment methodology for each market 
segment, including rigorous backtesting, must have been established for at least one year, 
and preferably at least 3 years. In this regard –  
 
(a)  the ECAI must document and have procedures in place to ensure that its 
assessment methodologies are applied consistently in the formulation of 
all credit assessments in a given asset class, industry sector or region251; 
 
(b)  the ECAI must establish a credit assessment committee with formalised 
terms of reference to approve credit assessments that have been 
recommended by credit assessment analysts. The ECAI must also have an 
independent internal audit function (or a function that plays a similar role 
and carries out similar tasks) to assess the compliance of the ECAI with 
its internal policies and procedures; 
 
(c)  the assessment methodologies of the ECAI must incorporate factors that 
are relevant in determining an entity’s creditworthiness. To the extent 
possible, the ECAI must be able to demonstrate that its assessment 
methodologies have produced accurate credit assessments in the past;   
 
(d) 
the assessment methodologies of the ECAI must be based on both 
qualitative and quantitative approaches; 
 
(e)  the assessment methodologies of the ECAI are subject to robust and 
quantitative backtesting based on at least one year of historical data, and 
 
250  
The Reporting Bank should perform an appropriate level of due diligence on the ECAI before submitting 
such a letter of support. 
251 
“Asset class” refers to categories such as loans, asset-backed securities, collateralised debt obligations, 
etc., “industry sector” refers to categories such as utilities, financial institutions, telecommunications, etc., 
and “region” refers to categories such as emerging markets, Asia ex-Japan, Europe, etc. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-67  
preferably 3 years. Other statistical studies 252  must be carried out 
periodically by the ECAI to validate its assessment methodologies over 
time and across different asset classes. Any systematic assessment errors 
identified through backtesting and other statistical reviews must be 
incorporated in the assessment methodologies; and 
 
(f)  the ECAI must have procedures that are written and implemented to 
ensure that its credit assessments are reviewed and updated at least 
annually or upon the occurrence of material events.   
 
7.3.131 
Independence:  A recognised ECAI must not be subject to economic, political 
and any other pressures that may influence its credit assessments. In particular, an ECAI 
must not delay or refrain from taking a rating action based on its potential effect (economic, 
political or otherwise).253 In this regard –  
 
(a)  the ECAI must have in place and implement adequate processes and 
safeguards to ensure that its ownership structure and board composition 
do not prejudice the objectivity of its credit assessments; 
 
(b)  the ECAI must not conduct any business transactions with any of the 
entities it assesses that could undermine the objectivity of its credit 
assessments; 
 
(c)  the ECAI must be able to demonstrate that its businesses, other than 
those incidental or synergistic to the issuance of credit assessments, are 
operationally separated from its credit assessment business; 
 
(d)  the ECAI must be able to demonstrate that its financial viability is not 
dependent on revenue generated from a few key customers;  
 
(e)  the ECAI must provide adequate disclosure of its pricing policy and any 
fee charged must not be dependent on the credit assessment issued; and 
 
(f)   employees of the ECAI must not be in an executive position in any of the 
entities assessed by the ECAI and must not be compensated in a way that 
could lead a compromise in the objectivity of the credit assessments. 
 
7.3.132 
International Access and Transparency:  The individual credit assessments of a 
recognised ECAI, the key elements underlying the assessments and whether the issuer 
participated in the assessment process must be publicly available on a non-selective basis, 
unless they are private assessments 254 . In addition, the general procedures, 
methodologies and assumptions for arriving at assessments used by a recognised ECAI 
must be publicly disclosed.   
 
 
252  
Examples are transition and default matrices. 
253  
The credit assessment process should be as free as possible from any constraints which could arise in 
situations where the composition of the board of directors or the shareholder structure of the ECAI may be 
seen as creating a conflict of interest. Furthermore, an ECAI should separate operationally, legally and, if 
practicable, physically, its credit assessment business from other businesses and analysts. 
254  
Private assessments should be at least available to both domestic and foreign institutions with legitimate 
interest and on equivalent terms. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-68  
7.3.133 
Disclosure:  A recognised ECAI must disclose its code of conduct, its 
compensation arrangements255, any conflict of interest, its assessment methodologies 
(including the definition of default, the time horizon, and the meaning of each credit 
assessment), the actual default rates experienced in each credit assessment category, and 
the transitions of the assessments.256 In this regard –  
 
(a)  the ECAI must make public the principles of its assessment methodologies;   
 
(b)  the ECAI must publicly disclose in a timely manner, any material changes 
made to its assessment methodologies or any significant event that could 
affect its performance on any of the criteria set out in paragraphs 7.3.130 
to 7.3.138;  
 
(c)  the ECAI must publicly disclose information regarding the meaning of each 
credit assessment category, actual default rates, transition matrices, 
definition of default and the time horizon for which a default is considered; 
and 
 
(d)  the ECAI must publicly disclose whether a credit assessment was solicited 
or unsolicited. For the latter, the ECAI must make public its definition of 
an unsolicited credit assessment. 
 
7.3.134 
Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 7.3.133, the following 
situations and their influence on the ECAI’s credit assessment methodologies or credit 
assessment actions must be disclosed as conflicts of interest mentioned under  
paragraph 7.3.133: 
 
(a) 
the ECAI is being paid to issue a credit assessment by the assessed entity 
or by the obligor, originator, underwriter, or arranger of the assessed 
obligation; 
 
(b) 
the ECAI is being paid by subscribers with a financial interest that could 
be affected by a credit assessment action of the ECAI; 
 
(c) 
the ECAI is being paid by assessed entities, obligors, originators, 
underwriters, arrangers, or subscribers for services other than issuing 
credit assessment or providing access to the ECAI’s credit assessments; 
 
255  
Regarding the disclosure of an ECAI's compensation arrangements –  
(a) 
the ECAI should disclose the general nature of its compensation arrangements with assessed entities, 
obligors, lead underwriters, and arrangers;  
(b) 
when the ECAI receives from an assessed entity, obligor, originator, lead underwriter, or arranger 
compensation unrelated to its credit assessment services, the ECAI should disclose such unrelated 
compensation as a percentage of total annual compensation received from such assessed entity, 
obligor, lead underwriter, or arranger in the relevant credit assessment report or elsewhere, as 
appropriate; and  
(c) 
the ECAI should disclose in the relevant credit assessment report or elsewhere, as appropriate, if it 
receives 10% or more of its annual revenue in aggregate from a single client (e.g. an assessed entity, 
obligor, originator, lead underwriter, arranger, or subscriber), related corporations and associates of 
the single client, and entities which the single client is an associate of.  
256  
For example, a recognised ECAI should disclose the likelihood of “AA” external credit assessments becoming 
“A” over time. The recognised ECAI should disclose a credit assessment as soon as practicably possible 
after issuance. When disclosing a credit assessment, the ECAI should provide the information in plain 
language, indicating the nature and limitation of credit assessment and the risk of unduly relying on it to 
make investments. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-69  
 
(d) 
the ECAI is providing a preliminary indication or similar indication of credit 
quality to an entity, obligor, originator, underwriter, or arranger prior to 
being hired, to determine the final credit assessment for the entity, obligor, 
originator, underwriter, or arranger; 
 
(e) 
the ECAI has a direct or indirect ownership interest in an assessed entity, 
or obligor, or an assessed entity or obligor has a direct or indirect 
ownership interest in the ECAI. 
 
7.3.135 
Resources:  A recognised ECAI must have sufficient resources to carry out credit 
assessments properly. These resources must allow for substantial ongoing contact with 
senior and operational levels within the entities assessed in order to add value to the credit 
assessments. A recognised ECAI must assign analysts with appropriate knowledge and 
experience to assess the creditworthiness of the type of entity or obligation being assessed. 
In this regard –   
 
(a) 
credit assessments must be made by a credit assessment committee 
composed of adequately qualified and experienced individuals, in 
accordance with the established criteria and methodology of the ECAI; 
 
(b)  the ECAI must possess a sufficient number of staff members with the 
requisite level of analytical skills and professional experience necessary 
for them to perform credit assessments competently; 
 
(c)  the ECAI must be financially sound and have enough resources to invest 
in the necessary infrastructure required for the efficient processing of data 
and timely release of reliable credit assessments; and 
 
(d)  the ECAI must establish recruitment and training policies for each level of 
analysts under its employment. 
 
7.3.136 
Credibility:  To some extent, credibility is derived from the criteria above. In 
addition, the reliance on an ECAI’s external credit assessments by independent parties257  
would be evidence of the credibility of the assessments of the ECAI. The credibility of an 
ECAI is also underpinned by the existence of internal procedures to prevent the misuse of 
confidential information. In order to be eligible for recognition, an ECAI does not have to 
assess firms in more than one country or jurisdiction. Considerations assessed by the 
Authority to determine if the ECAI satisfies this criterion include – 
 
(a)  the financial viability and market share of the ECAI, especially in the 
market for which the ECAI is operating and is to be recognised; 
 
(b)  the level of market acceptance and reliance on the credit assessments of 
the ECAI;  
 
(c) 
statistical data that demonstrates market reliance on the credit 
assessments of the ECAI258; and 
 
 
257  
For example, investors, insurers, trading partners. 
258  
For example, market movements in response to changes in credit assessments. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-70  
(d)  the presence of internal procedures to detect misuse or unauthorised 
disclosure or leakage of confidential information. 
 
7.3.137 
No abuse of unsolicited external credit assessments: A recognised ECAI must 
not use unsolicited external credit assessments to put pressure on entities to obtain 
external credit assessments.  
 
7.3.138 
Cooperation with the Authority:  A recognised ECAI must provide access to the 
Authority to external credit assessments, significant changes to methodologies and other 
relevant data in order to support initial and continued determination of eligibility. 
 
 
 
 
Mapping Process 
 
7.3.139 
The Authority shall map the external credit assessments of a recognised ECAI 
to the credit quality grades set out in Annex 7M, taking into account the qualitative factors 
set out in paragraph 7.3.140 and the guidelines for supervisors set out in “Standardised 
approach – implementing the mapping process (April 2019)” published by BCBS. 
  
7.3.140 
The qualitative factors considered by the Authority for the mapping process 
include –  
 
(a) 
the size and scope of the pool of issuers covered by the ECAI; 
 
(b) 
the range of credit assessments assigned by the ECAI; 
 
(c) 
the definition of each credit assessment category; 
 
(d) 
the definition of default used by the ECAI; 
 
(e) 
the dynamic properties and characteristics of the rating system or 
methodology; and 
 
(f) 
the geographical coverage (i.e. use of regional or global data).

Division 4:  IRBA  
 
Sub-division 1:  Application to Adopt the IRBA    
 
7.4.1 
A Reporting Bank which intends to adopt the IRBA for any class of exposures, 
must apply in writing to the Authority for approval to do so.  
 
7.4.2 
Subject to paragraph 7.4.3, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the application 
to adopt the IRBA for a class of exposures pursuant to paragraph 7.4.1 contains all of the 
following:   
 
(a) 
a written confirmation from the executive officer responsible for risk 
management in the Reporting Bank that –

applying to adopt the F-IRBA to calculate the credit risk-
weighted exposure amounts, internal estimates of PD; and  
 
(B) 
in the case of exposures for which the Reporting Bank is 
applying to adopt the A-IRBA or the IRBA for the IRBA retail 
asset class to calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure 
amounts, internal estimates of PD, LGD and EAD,  
 
form an integral part of the systems and processes of the Reporting 
Bank for managing credit risk; 
 
(ii)  the Reporting Bank has –  
 
(A) a process for managing the potential variability of its credit 
RWA over the business cycles of the respective industries and 
geographic regions which it is exposed to, to help ensure 
ongoing compliance with the minimum capital requirements 
specified in this Notice and bank-specific capital requirements 
set by the Authority pursuant to section 10(3) of the Banking 
Act;   
 
(B) carefully considered the implications of its IRBA systems on 
credit risk assessment and capital management; and 
 
(C) in the case where the Reporting Bank uses IRBA systems that 
would result in changes in its assessment of credit risk over a 
business 
cycle, 
ensured 
that

process 
for 
capital 
management is designed to address potential capital shortfalls 
in economic downturns; 
 
(iii) the Reporting Bank has a process for continually determining the 
suitability of its credit risk management strategy and framework as

credit RWA under the IRBA accurately and that those systems, 
processes and controls are subject to internal audit at least on an 
annual basis;  
 
(v) 
the Reporting Bank has a process to calculate the credit risk-
weighted exposure amount for any IRBA exposure using the SA(CR) 
in accordance with Sub-division 3 of Division 1 of this Part, within a 
3-month period if required by the Authority; and 
 
(vi) the IRBA rollout plan of the Reporting Bank is in accordance with 
Sub-division 4 of this Division and meets the Guidelines in Annex 7Y;   
 
(b)  a written confirmation from the executive officer responsible for internal 
audit of the Reporting Bank that –    
 
(i) 
he agrees with the confirmation by the executive officer responsible 
for risk management pursuant to sub-paragraph (a); and 
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank has –  
 
(A)  been using its rating system for the class of exposures in a 
manner broadly in line with the minimum standards for use as 
set out in paragraph 2.7 of Annex 7X for at least one year prior 
to the application; 
 
(B) conducted an internal validation of the rating system referred 
to in sub-paragraph (b)(ii)(A), pursuant to Annex 7X;  
 
(C) ascertained that it has the systems, processes and controls 
necessary for adopting the IRBA; and 
 
(D) in areas where the internal validation referred to in sub-
paragraph (b)(ii)(B) assesses that the Reporting Bank does not 
fully meet the requirements and guidelines of the Authority as 
set out in Annex 7X and Annex 7Z, conducted self-assessments 
to identify the key shortcomings, developed comprehensive 
action plans to address them, and identified in the action plans 
the personnel responsible for specific actions, resource needs 
and a schedule for completion260;  
 
(c) 
a report on the latest internal validation conducted by the Reporting Bank 
prior to the application and any relevant supporting documentation 
relating to the adoption of the IRBA for the class of exposures. For the 
 
259  
Annex 7X sets out the requirements of the Authority for a Reporting Bank adopting the IRBA. 
260  
The Reporting Bank should implement the measures described in its action plans within a reasonable 
timeframe. The Authority will take into consideration shortcomings identified and the Reporting Bank’s 
action plans to address them, including the schedule for completion, in its planning of the supervisory 
validation. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-73  
purposes of this paragraph, the internal validation report must cover a 
duration of at least one year during which the Reporting Bank must have 
used its rating system for the class of exposures in a manner broadly in 
line with the minimum standards for use as set out in paragraph 2.7 of 
Annex 7X. 
 
7.4.3  
Notwithstanding paragraph 7.4.2(a)(vi), the Reporting Bank need not provide 
a written confirmation from the executive officer responsible for risk management in the 
Reporting Bank, that the IRBA rollout plan of the Reporting Bank is in accordance with 
Sub-division 4 of this Division and meets the Guidelines in Annex 7Y if the Reporting Bank 
is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that it faces exigencies that are 
material and relevant. 
 
7.4.4 
Despite the cancellation of MAS Notice 637 in force immediately before  
1 July 2024, any application made by a Reporting Bank under paragraph 7.4.1 of that 
Notice, that is pending immediately before 1 July 2024, is treated as an application made 
by the Reporting Bank under paragraph 7.4.1 of this Notice. To avoid doubt, the Reporting 
Bank must comply with the requirements under Division 4 of Part VII of this Notice 
applicable to its application, including paragraphs 7.4.2, 7.4.5, 7.4.8 and 7.4.20 of this 
Notice. 
 
 
Sub-division 2: Submission of Information for Supervisory Validation Prior to 
IRBA Adoption 
 
7.4.5 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its CET1 CAR, Tier 1 CAR and Total CAR using 
both the IRBA and the prevailing capital requirements that are applicable to the Reporting 
Bank under this Notice at both the Solo and Group levels (referred to as “parallel 
calculations” in this Sub-division) as at the end of each quarter for the latest 4 consecutive 
quarters before its intended IRBA adoption date. To avoid doubt, where the Reporting 
Bank revises its intended IRBA adoption date, the Reporting Bank must perform the 
parallel calculations for the latest 4 consecutive quarters prior to the revised intended IRBA 
adoption date. 
 
7.4.6  
Despite paragraph 7.4.5, the Authority may require a Reporting Bank to submit 
additional parallel calculations as at other dates for other time periods, where necessary 
to ascertain the readiness of a Reporting Bank to adopt the IRBA.  
 
7.4.7  
To avoid doubt, for the purposes of paragraphs 7.4.5 and 7.4.6, the date on 
which a parallel calculation is based may precede the date on which the IRBA application 
was submitted to the Authority. 
 
7.4.8 
A Reporting Bank must submit to the Authority all parallel calculations referred 
to in paragraphs 7.4.5 and 7.4.6, before its intended IRBA adoption date, and within such 
timelines as specified by the Authority. To avoid doubt, where the Reporting Bank revises 
its intended IRBA adoption date, the Reporting Bank must submit to the Authority all 
parallel calculations, before the revised intended IRBA adoption date, and within such 
timelines as specified by the Authority.    
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-74  
7.4.9 
If a Reporting Bank becomes aware after the submission of its IRBA application 
but before receiving approval to adopt the IRBA, that the confirmations made pursuant to 
paragraph 7.4.2(a) and (b) are no longer valid, it must – 
 
(a) 
inform the Authority in writing as soon as practicable and, in any case, no 
later than 5 business days of the Reporting Bank becoming aware, of the 
invalidity of any confirmation; 
 
(b) 
assess the effect of the invalidity of the confirmation(s) in terms of the 
risk(s) posed to the Reporting Bank (if any); 
 
(c) 
prepare a plan to rectify the issues that led to the invalidity of the 
confirmation(s) and inform the Authority of its plan (including its target 
completion date for the plan) as soon as practicable; and  
 
(d) 
undertake prompt corrective action within a reasonable time in accordance 
with the plan prepared pursuant to sub-paragraph (c). 
 
7.4.10 
Where there are findings arising from the Authority’s supervisory validation 
which a Reporting Bank is required to address before its intended IRBA adoption date that 
could impact the parallel calculations previously submitted by a Reporting Bank under 
paragraph 7.4.8, the Authority may require the Reporting Bank, after it has addressed 
such findings, to recalculate and resubmit the parallel calculations previously submitted, 
or to submit additional parallel calculations, before its intended IRBA adoption date. To 
avoid doubt, where the Reporting Bank revises its intended IRBA adoption date, the 
Reporting Bank must, if required by the Authority, recalculate and resubmit the parallel 
calculations previously submitted, or submit additional parallel calculations, before the 
revised intended IRBA adoption date. 
 
 
Sub-division 3: Approval to Adopt the IRBA 
 
7.4.11 
The Authority may grant approval for a Reporting Bank to adopt the IRBA for a 
class of exposures, subject to such conditions or restrictions as the Authority may impose. 
The Authority may at any time vary or revoke any existing conditions or restrictions of 
approval, or impose conditions or restrictions, or additional conditions or restrictions 
thereto. 
 
7.4.12 
A Reporting Bank must comply with the public disclosure requirements set out 
in Part XI to be eligible to adopt the IRBA.  
 
7.4.13   
As part of its approval process, the Authority will consider whether –  
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank’s IRBA systems comply with the requirements and 
meet the guidelines set out in Annex 7X and Annex 7Z;   
 
(b)  the risk management process and system of the Reporting Bank are 
adequate to support the IRBA; and  
 
(c)  the Reporting Bank has addressed to the Authority’s satisfaction all 
findings arising from the Authority’s supervisory validation before its 
intended IRBA adoption date.   


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-75  
 
7.4.14 
The Authority may withhold approval for the Reporting Bank to adopt the IRBA 
for a class of exposures if – 
 
(a)  during its supervisory validation, it becomes aware of information that 
materially affects its assessment of the readiness of the Reporting Bank 
to adopt the IRBA for the class of exposures; or 
 
(b)    any outstanding finding identified during its supervisory validation that the 
Reporting Bank is required to address before its intended IRBA adoption 
date has not been addressed to the satisfaction of the Authority. 
 
7.4.15 
If a Reporting Bank becomes aware after it has received approval to adopt the 
IRBA for a class of exposures that any of the confirmations made pursuant to paragraph 
7.4.2(a) and (b) in force at the time the approval was granted are no longer valid, that it 
no longer complies with any of the conditions or restrictions imposed by the Authority 
pursuant to paragraph 7.4.11 or that it no longer complies with paragraph 7.4.12, it  
must – 
 
(a) 
inform the Authority in writing as soon as practicable and in any case no 
later than 5 business days of the Reporting Bank becoming aware, of the 
invalidity of any confirmations, any non-compliance with the conditions or 
restrictions pursuant to paragraph 7.4.11 or any non-compliance with 
paragraph 7.4.12, as the case may be; 
 
(b) 
assess the effect of the invalidity of the confirmation(s), non-compliance 
with the conditions or restrictions pursuant to paragraph 7.4.11 or non-
compliance with paragraph 7.4.12, as the case may be, in terms of the 
risk(s) posed to the Reporting Bank (if any); 
 
(c) 
prepare a plan to rectify the issues that led to the invalidity of the 
confirmation(s), non-compliance with the conditions or restrictions 
pursuant to paragraph 7.4.11 or non-compliance with paragraph 7.4.12, 
inform and seek approval from the Authority of its plan (including its target 
completion date for the plan) as soon as practicable; and  
 
(d) 
undertake prompt corrective action within a reasonable time in accordance 
with the plan prepared pursuant to sub-paragraph (c). 
 
7.4.16 
The Authority may suspend or revoke its approval for a Reporting Bank to adopt 
the IRBA for a class of exposures, subject the Reporting Bank to higher bank-specific 
capital requirements pursuant to section 10(3) of the Banking Act, or take any other 
actions if –  
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank has not complied with any of the conditions or 
restrictions imposed by the Authority pursuant to paragraph 7.4.11; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank has not complied with paragraph 7.4.12; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank fails to comply with paragraph 7.4.15; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-76  
(d)  the Authority subsequently becomes aware that the Reporting Bank has 
furnished information that is false or misleading in a material manner to 
the Authority in connection with its application for approval to adopt the 
IRBA; 
 
(e) 
the Reporting Bank has not executed its IRBA rollout in accordance with 
Sub-division 4 of this Division; or 
 
(f) 
the Authority is not satisfied that the Reporting Bank is in compliance with 
the requirements in Annex 7X, or that the risk management process and 
system of the Reporting Bank are adequate to support the IRBA. 
 
7.4.17 
A Reporting Bank must inform the Authority no less than 3 months prior to the 
expected date of implementation of any significant change to its IRBA systems subsequent 
to the Authority granting approval for the Reporting Bank to adopt the IRBA for a class of 
exposures, unless the Authority has directed that the Reporting Bank seeks prior approval 
for any such change. The Authority may also direct the Reporting Bank to seek approval 
prior to any significant change to its IRBA systems, subsequent to the notification by the 
Reporting Bank to the Authority. 
 
7.4.18 
Despite the cancellation of MAS Notice 637 in force immediately before 1 July 
2024, 
 
(a) 
any approval granted under paragraph 7.4.10 of that Notice, that was in 
force immediately before 1 July 2024, is treated as an approval granted 
under paragraph 7.4.11 of this Notice; and 
 
(b) 
any condition or restriction imposed by the Authority pursuant to 
paragraph 7.4.10 of that Notice will continue to apply as though it were 
imposed under paragraph 7.4.11 of this Notice.  
 
7.4.19 
A Reporting Bank granted the approval referred to in paragraph 7.4.18(a) must 
comply with all applicable requirements in this Notice as though the approval was granted 
under paragraph 7.4.11 of this Notice, except that a reference to “confirmations made 
pursuant to paragraph 7.4.2(a) and (b) in force at the time the approval was granted” in 
paragraph 7.4.15 of this Notice must be read to mean “confirmations made pursuant to 
paragraph 7.4.2(a) and (b) of MAS Notice 637 in force immediately before 1 July 2024”. 
 
 
Sub-division 4: IRBA Rollout  
 
7.4.20 
A Reporting Bank must, in its application to the Authority to adopt the IRBA for 
a class of exposures pursuant to paragraph 7.4.1, submit an IRBA rollout plan for the IRBA 
asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes, as set out in paragraph 1.2 of 
Annex 7Y, specifying to what extent and when it intends to rollout the IRBA for the IRBA 
asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes across business units of the 
banking group.  
 
7.4.21  
A Reporting Bank which has obtained IRBA approval for any class of exposures 
pursuant to paragraph 7.4.11 must provide to the Authority the status of, and updates to, 
its IRBA rollout plan in respect of the IRBA asset sub-classes or combination of IRBA asset 
sub-classes, as set out in paragraph 1.2 of Annex 7Y every 12 months. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-77  
 
7.4.22 
Where a Reporting Bank adopts the IRBA for a class of exposures in –  
 
(a) 
an IRBA asset sub-class; or 
 
(b) 
combination of IRBA asset sub-classes; 
 
as set out in paragraph 1.2 of Annex 7Y, and the class of exposures fall within a particular 
business unit, it must apply the IRBA to all exposures within that business unit that fall 
within the same IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes.  
 
7.4.23  
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.4.20 and 7.4.22, a Reporting Bank must show 
how it defines the boundaries of a putative business unit and how it allocates exposures 
to that business unit on an ongoing basis.  
 
7.4.24 
If a Reporting Bank that has adopted the IRBA for an IRBA asset sub-class or 
combination of IRBA asset sub-classes, as set out in paragraph 1.2 of Annex 7Y, intends 
to adopt the SA(CR) or F-IRBA instead, it must only do so in exceptional circumstances 
which have been approved by the Authority261. 
 
7.4.25   
A Reporting Bank may continue to use the supervisory slotting criteria for one 
or more of the 4 categories of the SL asset sub-class as set out in Annex 7R or the HVCRE 
asset sub-class, and adopt the F-IRBA or A-IRBA for the other categories of the SL asset 
sub-class or the HVCRE asset sub-class. Where a Reporting Bank has adopted the F-IRBA 
or A-IRBA for the IPRE lending exposures under the SL asset sub-class, and where the 
IPRE lending exposures are material, the Reporting Bank must adopt the F-IRBA or A-
IRBA, as the case may be, for the HVCRE asset sub-class. 
 
7.4.26 
A Reporting Bank must not, during the period when it is rolling out the adoption 
of the IRBA for the banking group, undertake intra-group transactions (including but not 
limited to asset sales or cross guarantees) which are designed to reduce the banking 
group’s aggregate capital requirements by transferring credit risk between entities on the 
SA(CR) and entities on the IRBA.   
 
 
Exclusions from the IRBA 
 
7.4.27 
Where a Reporting Bank adopts the IRBA for part of its exposures for an IRBA 
asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes, as set out in paragraph 1.2 of 
Annex 7Y, the Reporting Bank may exclude from the IRBA, exposures that would fall within 
that IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes – 
 
(a)  in the case of exposures arising from the acquisition of a new business or 
entity by the Reporting Bank – 
 
 
261  
Where a Reporting Bank has adopted the IRBA for the IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset 
sub-classes as set out in paragraph 1.2 of Annex 7Y, it should continue to adopt the IRBA. The Reporting 
Bank may be allowed to adopt the SA(CR) or F-IRBA in instances such as a divestiture of a large fraction 
of the Reporting Bank’s credit-related business, subject to the approval by the Authority. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-78  
(i)  
if the exposures acquired are immaterial in size and risk profile within 
the IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes; 
or  
 
(ii)  the Reporting Bank will transition the exposures acquired onto the 
IRBA and incorporate the exposures as part of its IRBA rollout plan 
for the IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset-sub 
classes, 
 
provided that the Reporting Bank had obtained the prior approval of the 
Authority, which may be subject to conditions imposed by the Authority 
with respect to the approval; and 
 
(b)  in all other cases, if the exposures are immaterial in size and risk profile 
within the IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes, 
provided that the Reporting Bank had obtained the prior approval of the 
Authority, which may be subject to conditions imposed by the Authority 
with respect to the approval. 
 
7.4.28  
A Reporting Bank may exclude exposures that are mentioned in paragraph 
7.4.27(b) from its IRBA rollout plan.  
 
7.4.29  
A Reporting Bank must use the SA(CR) to calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amounts for exposures excluded from the IRBA pursuant to paragraph 7.4.27. 
In such cases, the Authority may require the Reporting Bank to maintain additional capital 
under Part X for such exposures. 
 
7.4.30 
Despite paragraph 7.4.27, a Reporting Bank may use the SA(CR) to calculate 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amounts for long settlement transactions on a 
permanent basis without any prior approval of the Authority. 
 
7.4.31  
For the purposes of obtaining the Authority’s approval in accordance with 
paragraph 7.4.27(a)(i) and (b), as applicable, a Reporting Bank must show why the 
exposures falling within an IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-class 
that it proposes to exclude from the IRBA are considered to be immaterial both in terms 
of size and risk profile within their IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-
classes as set out in paragraph 1.2 of Annex 7Y.262  
 
7.4.32 
When approving exclusions, the Authority will consider a Reporting Bank’s 
ability to meet the threshold specified in paragraph 2.2 of Annex 7Y and risk concentrations 
that may be present in excluded portfolios. 
 
7.4.33 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the percentage of exposures excluded from 
the IRBA in each IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes as set out 
in paragraph 1.2 of Annex 7Y as follows:  
 
(a) 
for the IRBA sovereign asset sub-class, by dividing the total exposure 
amount of exposures excluded from the IRBA which would fall within the 
 
262  
The Authority may revoke any approval previously given under paragraph 7.4.27(a)(i) or (b), if the 
exposures become material in size or risk profile. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-79  
IRBA sovereign asset sub-class if the IRBA had been adopted (“excluded 
exposures”), by the aggregate of –  
 
(i)  
the total exposure amount of exposures under the IRBA sovereign 
asset sub-class; 
 
(ii)  the total exposure amount of exposures transitioning to the IRBA 
sovereign asset sub-class; and  
 
(iii) excluded exposures,  
 
for all on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items within the 
scope of paragraph 7.1.1(a), (b) and (f); 
 
(b) 
for all other IRBA asset sub-classes or combination of IRBA asset sub-
classes set out in paragraph 1.2 of Annex 7Y, by dividing the total RWA of 
exposures excluded from the IRBA for an IRBA asset sub-class or 
combination of IRBA asset sub-classes which would fall within that IRBA 
asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes if the IRBA had 
been adopted (“RWA of excluded exposures”), by the aggregate of –  
 
(i) 
the total RWA of exposures under that IRBA asset sub-class or 
combination of IRBA asset sub-classes; 
 
(ii) 
the total RWA of exposures transitioning to that IRBA asset sub-class 
or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes; and  
 
(iii) RWA of excluded exposures,  
 
for all on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items within the 
scope of paragraph 7.1.1(a), (b) and (f). 
 
7.4.34 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.33(a), a Reporting Bank must calculate the 
exposure amount of each exposure, whether such exposures are under the IRBA, 
transitioning to the IRBA or excluded from the IRBA, by applying the exposure 
measurement requirements in paragraphs 7.1.3(a) and 7.1.9(a). 
 
7.4.35  
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.33(b), the Reporting Bank must calculate 
the RWA of each exposure, whether such exposures are under the IRBA, transitioning to 
the IRBA or excluded from the IRBA, by applying the requirements in paragraphs 7.1.3 
and 7.1.9.  
 
7.4.36 
For the purposes of the calculation in paragraph 7.4.33, a Reporting Bank  
must – 
 
(a)  map its SA(CR) exposures to the relevant IRBA asset sub-class that the 
SA(CR) exposure would fall within, if the IRBA was applied for the 
exposure. A Reporting Bank may assume that SA(CR) exposures within 
the ADC asset sub-class would fall within the IRBA SL asset sub-class; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-80  
(b)  exclude the exposure amount of the following exposures from excluded 
exposures, and from the aggregate of exposure amounts set out in 
paragraph 7.4.33(a)(i) to (iii), for the calculation in paragraph 7.4.33(a): 
 
(i)  
equity exposures set out in paragraphs 7.3.9 and 7.3.10; 
 
(ii)  exposures required to be deducted from regulatory capital or risk-
weighted at 250% under paragraph 7.3.104; 
 
(iii) exposures risk-weighted at 1250% under paragraph 7.3.82; and 
 
(c) 
exclude the RWA of the following exposures from the RWA of excluded 
exposures, and from the aggregate of RWA amounts set out in paragraph 
7.4.33(b)(i) to (iii), for the calculation in paragraph 7.4.33(b): 
 
(i)  
equity exposures set out in paragraphs 7.3.9 and 7.3.10; 
 
(ii)  exposures required to be deducted from regulatory capital or risk-
weighted at 250% under paragraph 7.3.104; 
 
(iii) exposures risk-weighted at 1250% under paragraph 7.3.82. 
 
7.4.37 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that exposures to central CCPs arising from OTC 
derivative transactions, exchange-traded derivative transactions and SFTs are treated in 
accordance with the relevant requirements set out under Division 7 of this Part, 
irrespective of materiality. 
 
 
Sub-division 5: Categorisation of IRBA Exposures 
 
7.4.38 
A Reporting Bank must categorise any IRBA exposure into an asset sub-class 
belonging to the IRBA wholesale asset class, the IRBA retail asset class or the IRBA eligible 
purchased receivables asset class263 as defined in paragraphs 7.4.42 to 7.4.56.   
 
7.4.39 
A Reporting Bank must apply the specified treatment set out in this Sub-division 
to each of its exposures for the purposes of deriving its regulatory capital adequacy 
requirements. A Reporting Bank must be able to demonstrate to the Authority that its 
methodology for assigning exposures to the different asset sub-classes is appropriate and 
consistent over time. Where the Authority deems that the methodology used by the 
Reporting Bank is not appropriate or may not result in broadly consistent categorisation 
across Reporting Banks, the Authority may require the Reporting Bank to re-categorise 
any exposure or class of exposures into asset sub-classes as set out in this Sub-division. 
 
7.4.40 
A Reporting Bank must treat any exposure within the scope of paragraph 
7.1.1(a) that does not fall within any of the IRBA wholesale asset class, the IRBA retail 
asset class or the IRBA eligible purchased receivables asset class as an SA(CR) exposure  
under one of the following asset classes, whichever relevant, in accordance with Division 
3 of this Part: 
 
263 
The categorisation of exposures into various asset sub-classes as set out in this Sub-division is intended to 
be consistent with established industry practice. However, the Authority recognises that a Reporting Bank 
may use different definitions and methodology for the purposes of internal reporting and risk measurement.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore

(a) 
cash items under paragraph 7.3.1(a); 
 
(b) 
equity and subordinated debt asset class under paragraph 7.3.1(h); 
 
(c) 
other exposures asset class under paragraph 7.3.1(l).  
7.4.41 
In the case of a lease where the Reporting Bank is a lessor and is exposed to 
residual value risk, the Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
categorise the exposure to the lessee, calculated under paragraph 
7.2.7(a), in accordance with paragraph 7.4.38; and 
 
(b) 
treat the exposure to the residual value of the leased assets, calculated 
under paragraph 7.2.7(b), in accordance with paragraph 7.4.40(c).  
 
7.4.42 
The IRBA wholesale asset class consists of the following asset sub-classes: 
 
(a) 
general corporate asset sub-class, which consists of –  
 
(i) 
any IRBA exposure to a corporation, partnership, limited liability 
partnership, sole proprietorship, trust or fund (but excludes an 
exposure belonging to an asset sub-class set out in sub-paragraph 
(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f), paragraph 7.4.50(c), or paragraph 7.4.56(a), 
(b) or (c)); and 
 
(ii) 
any IRBA exposure to an individual (but excludes an exposure 
belonging to an asset sub-class set out in sub-paragraph (b), (c), 
(d), (e) or (f), paragraph 7.4.50(a), (b) or (c), or paragraph 
7.4.56(a), (b) or (c)); 
 
(b)  corporate small business asset sub-class, which consists of any IRBA 
exposure to a corporation, partnership, limited liability partnership, sole 
proprietorship, trust or fund (“business”) (but excludes an exposure 
belonging to an asset sub-class set out in sub-paragraph (c), (d), (e) or 
(f), paragraph 7.4.50(c), or paragraph 7.4.56(a), (b) or (c)), where the 
reported annual revenue of the business determined in accordance with 
paragraph 7.4.43 is less than or equal to S$100 million or where 
paragraph 7.4.45 applies.  
 
(c) 
sovereign asset sub-class, which consists of any IRBA exposure to – 
 
(i) 
the counterparties referred to in paragraph 7.3.1(b); 
 
(ii) 
a PSE, where such exposure would qualify for a 0% or 20% risk 
weight under the SA(CR) pursuant to paragraph 7.3.48 and Table 7-
3; or 
 
(iii) a qualifying MDB;  
 
(d) 
bank asset sub-class, which consists of any IRBA exposure – 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-82  
(i) 
to the counterparties referred to in paragraph 7.3.1(e)(i) to (v); 
 
(ii) 
to a PSE (but excludes an exposure referred to in sub-paragraph 
(c)(ii));  
 
(iii) to an MDB which is not a qualifying MDB; or 
 
(iv) which is an eligible covered bond referred to in paragraph 7.3.2; 
 
(e) 
SL asset sub-class, which consists of any IRBA exposure that meets the 
characteristics set out in Annex 7R (but excludes an exposure belonging 
to the IRBA asset sub-class set out in sub-paragraph (f)); 
 
(f) 
HVCRE asset sub-class, which consists of any IRBA exposure that meets 
the characteristics set out in Annex 7R.  
 
7.4.43 
For the purposes of determining whether a business mentioned under 
paragraph 7.4.42(b) has a reported annual revenue of less than or equal to S$100 million, 
the Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
if the business is part of a group of companies as defined in section 209A 
of the Companies Act 1967, use the reported annual consolidated revenue 
of the group of companies; 
 
(b)  have in place rigorous information gathering and timely updating 
processes to ensure that the reported annual revenue figure used is timely 
and relevant;   
 
(c)  use an audited reported annual revenue figure, but where a business is 
established in a country or jurisdiction where the legislation governing the 
preparation of the business’s financial statement does not require audited 
financial statements to be maintained, the Reporting Bank may use 
unaudited accounts to ascertain the reported annual revenue figure; 
 
(d)  subject unaudited accounts used to ascertain the reported annual revenue 
figures under sub-paragraph (c) to an internal or external independent 
verification conducted on an annual basis;  
 
(e)  use a reported annual revenue figure taken from the most recent full-year 
financial statements, which must be for a financial period ending not more 
than 21 months before the time when the credit risk-weighted exposure 
amount for that IRBA exposure is calculated, unless paragraph 7.4.44 
applies264; and 
 
(f) 
not categorise an exposure under the corporate small business asset sub-
class if it becomes aware of any event after the date of the financial 
statements referred to in sub-paragraph (e) that would reasonably cause 
an adjustment of the reported annual revenue of the business such that it 
is more than S$100 million. 
 
264  
For example, a Reporting Bank must not use the reported annual revenue figure for the 12 months ending 
31 Dec 2022 for calculating credit risk-weighted exposure amounts after 30 Sep 2024.   


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-83  
 
7.4.44 
Despite paragraph 7.4.43(e), where subsequent to the Reporting Bank’s initial 
categorisation of an IRBA exposure into the corporate small business asset sub-class, a 
Reporting Bank is unable to obtain updated financial statements of the business, the 
Reporting Bank may use a reported annual revenue figure taken from full-year financial 
statements which are for a financial period ending more than 21 months before the time 
when the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for that IRBA exposure is calculated. In 
such a case, the Reporting Bank may continue to categorise such exposures under the 
corporate small business asset sub-class, but must not use the reported annual revenue 
figure of the obligor in the Ksm formulas stated in paragraph 7.4.65. 
 
7.4.45 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.42(b), a Reporting Bank may include an IRBA 
exposure to a business mentioned under paragraph 7.4.42(b), with reported total assets 
of less than or equal to S$100 million, provided that –  
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank has in place internal policies setting out the types of 
entities and circumstances, where total revenue is not a meaningful 
indicator of the size of an entity and the use of reported total assets is 
more appropriate than reported annual revenue;  
 
(b)  the internal policies mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) have been approved 
in writing by the Authority; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank applies the reported total assets threshold and the 
internal policies mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) consistently to all 
exposures for each type of entity identified in those internal policies; and 
 
(d) 
based on the Reporting Bank’s application of the reported total assets 
threshold and internal policies mentioned in sub-paragraph (a), the total 
revenue is not a meaningful indicator of the size of the entity and the use 
of reported total assets is more appropriate than reported annual revenue. 
 
7.4.46  
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.45 and determining whether a business 
mentioned under paragraph 7.4.42(b) has reported total assets of less than or equal to 
S$100 million, the Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
if the business is part of a group of companies as defined in section 209A 
of the Companies Act 1967, use the reported consolidated total assets of 
the group of companies; 
 
(b)  have in place rigorous information gathering and timely updating 
processes to help ensure that the reported total assets figure used is 
timely and relevant;   
 
(c)  use an audited reported total assets figure, but where a business is 
established in a country or jurisdiction where the legislation governing the 
preparation of the business’s financial statement does not require audited 
financial statements to be maintained, the Reporting Bank may use 
unaudited accounts to ascertain the reported total assets figure;  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-84  
(d)  subject unaudited accounts used to ascertain the reported total assets 
figures under sub-paragraph (c) to an internal or external independent 
verification conducted on an annual basis;  
 
(e) 
use a reported total assets figure taken from the most recent full-year 
financial statements, which must be for a financial period ending not more 
than 21 months before the time when the credit risk-weighted exposure 
amount for that IRBA exposure is calculated, unless paragraph 7.4.47 
applies265; and  
 
(f) 
not categorise an exposure under the corporate small business asset sub-
class if it becomes aware of any event after the date of the financial 
statements referred to in sub-paragraph (e) that would reasonably cause 
an adjustment of the reported total assets of the business such that it is  
more than S$100 million. 
 
7.4.47 
Despite paragraph 7.4.46(f), where subsequent to the Reporting Bank’s initial 
categorisation of an IRBA exposure into the corporate small business asset sub-class, a 
Reporting Bank is unable to obtain updated financial statements of the business, the 
Reporting Bank may use a reported total assets figure taken from full-year financial 
statements which are for a financial period ending more than 21 months before the time 
when the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for that IRBA exposure is calculated. In 
such a case, the Reporting Bank may continue to categorise such exposures under the 
corporate small business asset sub-class, but must not use the reported total assets figure 
of the obligor in the Ksm formulas stated in paragraph 7.4.65; 
 
7.4.48 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.42, “fund” includes any collective investment 
scheme or closed-end fund. 
 
7.4.49 
To avoid doubt, the general corporate asset sub-class in paragraph 7.4.42(a), 
corporate small business asset sub-class in paragraph 7.4.42(b), and bank asset sub-class 
in paragraph 7.4.42(d) include exposures to the relevant entities listed in those 
paragraphs that are in the form of subordinated debt or regulatory capital instruments, 
provided that such instruments –  
 
(a) 
do not fall within the scope of equity exposures as set out in paragraphs 
7.3.9 and 7.3.10; 
 
(b) 
are not required to be deducted from regulatory capital or risk-weighted 
at 250% under paragraph 7.3.104; and 
 
(c) 
are not risk-weighted at 1250% under paragraph 7.3.82. 
 
A Reporting Bank must treat an instrument which meets one of the criteria in sub-
paragraph (a), (b) or (c) as an SA(CR) exposure in accordance with Division 3 of this Part. 
 
 
265  
For example, a Reporting Bank must not use the reported total assets figure for the 12 months ending  
31 Dec 2022 for calculating credit risk-weighted exposure amounts after 30 Sep 2024.   


Monetary Authority of Singapore

The IRBA retail asset class266 consists of the following asset sub-classes set out 
in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c): 
 
(a)    residential mortgage asset sub-class, which consists of any IRBA exposure 
(but excludes an exposure belonging to the asset sub-class set out in 
paragraph 7.4.56(c)) that meets all of the following conditions: 
 
(i) 
the exposure is extended to – 
 
(A)  an individual;  
 
(B) a group of individuals; or  
 
(C) an association of individuals or a co-operative of individuals, 
where such association or co-operative is regulated under 
national law and is established only for the purposes of granting 
its members the use of a primary residence in the property 
securing the exposure; 
 
(ii) 
the exposure is managed by the Reporting Bank as part of a large 
pool of similar loans; 
 
(iii) the exposure is secured or partly secured against a mortgage of a 
residential property;  
 
(b) 
QRRE asset sub-class, which consists of any IRBA exposure (but excludes 
an exposure belonging to the asset sub-class set out in paragraph 
7.4.56(c)) which meets all of the following conditions: 
 
(i) 
the exposure is to an individual;  
 
(ii) 
the exposure is managed by the Reporting Bank as part of a large 
pool of similar exposures;  
 
(iii) the exposure is to a revolving loan, and is unsecured, and 
uncommitted both contractually and in practice;  
 
(iv) the exposure, including any exposure in the QRRE asset sub-class to 
the same individual that is classified as in default in accordance with 
the definition of default in Annex 7L, together with other exposures  
in the QRRE asset sub-class to the same individual, is not more than 
S$200,000;  
 
(v) 
the Reporting Bank demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Authority 
that the exposures categorised under this asset sub-class exhibit a 
low volatility of loss rates, relative to the average level of loss rates, 
 
266 
For example, exposures to individuals granted revolving loans (e.g. credit cards, overdrafts, or retail 
facilities secured by financial instruments) as well as personal term loans and leases (e.g. instalment loans, 
auto loans and leases, student and educational loans, personal finance, or other exposures with similar 
characteristics) are eligible for retail treatment.

at both the aggregate QRRE asset sub-class level and relevant sub-
portfolio level where applicable, especially within the low PD bands;  
 
(vi) the Reporting Bank retains data on the loss rates for the purposes of 
analysis of loss volatilities;  
 
(vii) the Reporting Bank is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Authority that treatment as QRRE is consistent with the underlying 
risk characteristics of the QRRE asset sub-class and the relevant sub-
portfolio where applicable;  
 
(c) 
other retail exposures asset sub-class, which consists of any IRBA 
exposure (but excludes an exposure belonging to an asset sub-class set 
out in sub-paragraph (a) or (b), or paragraph 7.4.56(c)) that meets the 
following conditions:  
 
(i) 
the exposure is to an individual and the exposure is managed as part 
of a large pool of similar exposures; or   
 
(ii) 
the exposure is to a small business and –  
 
(A) the total exposure of the Reporting Bank to the small business 
(on a consolidated basis where applicable) is not more than S$2 
million, gross of CRM. 267  For the purposes of determining 
whether the S$2 million threshold is met, the Reporting Bank 
must –  
 
(I) 
include any exposure to the same small business that is 
classified as in default in accordance with the definition of 
default in Annex 7L, but must not include any IRBA 
exposure in the residential mortgage asset sub-class;  
 
(II) subject to paragraph 7.4.54, ensure that the basis of 
aggregation for total exposures to the small business on 
a consolidated basis, is the same basis on which the 
Reporting Bank treats an obligor in a group of obligors, 
for its risk management purposes, and must include 
exposures to related corporations of the obligor, and 
exposures to the sole proprietors or partners in any of the 
entities in the group of obligors; and 
 
(III) aggregate exposures to the same small business which 
are extended through or guaranteed by an individual; and 
 
 
267 
When an IRBA exposure categorised under the other retail exposures asset sub-class pursuant to this 
provision exceeds the S$2 million threshold, a Reporting Bank should re-categorise the exposure under the 
general corporate asset sub-class or corporate small business asset sub-class. The Authority will be flexible 
if the need for re-categorisation arises solely from short-term exchange rate fluctuations, for example, 
exchange rate fluctuations of non-Singapore dollar-denominated assets. In such cases, the Authority would 
expect the Reporting Bank to establish appropriate policies and procedures to determine when the threshold 
is exceeded in a more permanent way, for example, through the extension of increased credit or a major 
currency revaluation, and to re-categorise the exposures if necessary. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-87  
(B) the exposure qualifies as a retail small business exposure in 
accordance with the internal written policies of the Reporting 
Bank, and is managed by the Reporting Bank as part of a large 
pool of similar exposures consistently over time and in the 
same manner as other exposures categorised under the IRBA 
retail asset class. This means that the exposure is originated in 
a similar manner to other exposures categorised under the 
IRBA retail asset class, and is not managed individually in a way 
comparable to exposures categorised under the general 
corporate asset sub-class or corporate small business asset 
sub-class, but rather as part of a pool of exposures with similar 
risk characteristics for the purposes of risk assessment and 
quantification.  
 
7.4.51 
The Reporting Bank must have controls to ensure that any inadvertent 
assignment of exposures that do not meet the conditions in paragraph 7.4.50 to the IRBA 
retail asset class would be sufficiently immaterial that it would not result in any significant 
distortion of the overall statistical characteristics of the pools. To avoid doubt, the 
Reporting Bank must not use cost considerations to justify inclusion of exposures that do 
not meet the conditions in paragraph 7.4.50 if the effect on the statistical characteristics 
of the pools would be material.268 
 
7.4.52  
For the purposes of categorising an exposure in the QRRE asset sub-class under 
paragraph 7.4.50(b), in the case where a Reporting Bank segments its QRRE asset sub-
class into 2 or more sub-portfolios, a Reporting Bank must ensure that such segmentation 
is performed in a manner consistent with the segmentation of its retail activities 
generally.269 
 
7.4.53 
The Reporting Bank must categorise an exposure in the QRRE asset sub-class 
mentioned under paragraph 7.4.50(b) into any one of the following categories of 
exposures:  
 
(a) QRRE transactor, which refers to an exposure in the QRRE asset sub-class 
to an obligor in relation to facilities including credit cards and charge cards 
where the billed balance has been repaid in full at or before each scheduled 
repayment date for the previous 12 months, or in relation to overdrafts 
that have not been drawn down over the previous 12 months; 
 
(b) QRRE revolver, which refers to any other exposure in the QRRE asset sub-
class that is not a QRRE transactor, including any exposure with less than 
12 months of repayment history. 
 
7.4.54  
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.50(c)(ii)(A)(II), the Reporting Bank may 
disaggregate its exposures to an obligor in a group of obligors if it has assessed that the 
disaggregated obligor has sufficient financial resources to fully service the obligor’s 
liabilities and does not need to depend on any other entity within the group of obligors for 
financial assistance in meeting the liabilities. A Reporting Bank must not disaggregate 
based on product type alone. 
 
 
268  
Sample testing may be one method of demonstrating that such impact would be immaterial. 
269  
A Reporting Bank should, at a minimum, segment by country or jurisdiction. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-88  
7.4.55 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.50(c)(ii)(B), an exposure to a small business 
will not normally be considered to be individually managed in a way comparable to 
exposures categorised under the general corporate asset sub-class or corporate small 
business asset sub-class if management of that exposure – 
 
(a) is sufficiently insignificant so as not to disrupt the homogeneity of the pool; 
 
(b) is consistent with the management of other exposures in the same pool; 
and 
 
(c) is significantly different in extent from the individual management that 
occurs for exposures categorised under the general corporate asset sub-
class or corporate small business asset sub-class, looked at as a whole.   
 
7.4.56 
The IRBA eligible purchased receivables asset class consists of the following 
asset sub-classes: 
 
(a) 
purchased corporate receivables asset sub-class, which consists of 
purchased receivables that meet the criteria for categorisation under the 
corporate asset sub-class; 
 
(b) 
purchased corporate small business receivables asset sub-class, which 
consists of purchased receivables that meet the criteria for categorisation 
under the corporate small business asset sub-class;  
 
(c) 
purchased retail receivables asset sub-class, which consists of purchased 
receivables that meet the criteria for categorisation under the IRBA retail 
asset class.   
 
 
Sub-division 6: Calculation of Capital Requirements, K, under the IRBA  
 
7.4.57 
Subject to paragraphs 7.4.58 and 7.4.61, a Reporting Bank using the IRBA 
must – 
(a) 
for an IRBA exposure not classified as in default in accordance with the 
definition of default in Annex 7L, calculate K for that exposure in 
accordance with Sub-divisions 8, 9, 10, and 11 of this Division, whichever 
is applicable; and 
 
(b) 
for an IRBA exposure that is classified as in default in accordance with the 
definition of default in Annex 7L, calculate K for that exposure in 
accordance with Sub-division 12.270 
 
7.4.58 
A Reporting Bank must not use the A-IRBA for any of the following IRBA 
exposures: 
 
 
270  
The credit RWA under the IRBA has been calibrated to cover only the unexpected losses that could arise 
from the credit and investment related risks of a Reporting Bank for exposures in the banking book. A 
Reporting Bank should consider whether it has set aside sufficient allowances to cover the EL amounts that 
could arise from such exposures. Paragraph 6.1.5(e) provides for the appropriate deduction in the 
calculation of CET1 Capital in the event that a Reporting Bank has not set aside sufficient allowances to 
cover the EL amounts that could arise. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-89  
(a) 
exposures categorised in the general corporate asset sub-class in 
paragraph 7.4.42(a), to an entity which belongs to a group with total 
consolidated annual revenue greater than S$750 million; 
 
(b) 
exposures categorised in the bank asset sub-class in paragraph 7.4.42(d); 
 
(c) 
exposures to any financial institution, including exposures to securities 
firms and insurance companies, which are categorised in the general 
corporate asset sub-class in paragraph 7.4.42(a) or corporate small 
business asset sub-class in paragraph 7.4.42(b).   
 
7.4.59 
For the purposes of determining whether the S$750 million total consolidated 
annual revenue threshold in paragraph 7.4.58(a) is met, the Reporting Bank must use the 
reported total revenue of the entity. For an entity that is part of a consolidated group, the 
Reporting Bank must use the reported total revenue of the consolidated group of 
companies which includes the entity, according to the accounting standard applicable to 
the ultimate parent of the consolidated group. In calculating the total consolidated annual 
revenue, the Reporting Bank must calculate the average reported total annual revenue 
based on the most recent 3 consecutive years of audited financial statements.    
 
7.4.60 
For the purposes of calculating Kcorp, Ksov, Kbank, Ksl, Ksm, Khv, Kmort, Kqrre and Koret 
in Sub-divisions 8 and 9 of this Division –  
 
(a) 
Ln denotes the natural logarithm;  
 
(b) 
N(x) denotes the cumulative distribution function for a standard normal 
random variable (i.e. the probability that a normal random variable with 
mean zero and variance of one is less than or equal to x)271; and 
 
(c) 
G(z) denotes the inverse cumulative distribution function for a standard 
normal random variable (i.e. the value of x such that N(x) = z)272.  
 
 
Sub-division 7: Calculation of Capital Requirements, K, and Determination of 
Risk Weights, RWslot, for Exposures in the SL Asset Sub-Class and 
HVCRE Asset Sub-Class under the IRBA  
 
7.4.61 
For any IRBA exposure belonging to the SL asset sub-class or HVCRE asset sub-
class, a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
if the Reporting Bank complies with the requirements for wholesale 
exposures under the F-IRBA in Annex 7X for deriving estimates of PD for 
such exposures, or the requirements for wholesale exposures under the 
A-IRBA in Annex 7X for deriving estimates of PD, LGD and EAD for such 
exposures, calculate K for that exposure in accordance with Sub-division 
6 of this Division; and 
 
 
271  
The normal cumulative distribution function is, for example, available in Excel as the function NORMSDIST. 
272  
The inverse of the normal cumulative distribution function is, for example, available in Excel as the function

Calculation of Kcorp, Ksov, Kbank and Ksl 
 
7.4.62 
A Reporting Bank must calculate Kcorp, Ksov, Kbank and Ksl for an IRBA exposure 
in the general corporate, sovereign, bank and SL asset sub-classes, respectively, using 
the following formula:  
 
Correlation (R) = 0.12 × 
(1−𝑒−50 ×𝑃𝐷)

(1+(𝑀−2.5)×𝑏)
(1−1.5×𝑏)
  
 
Illustrative risk weights are set out in Annex 7AA. 
 
7.4.63 
Despite paragraph 7.4.62, for all IRBA exposures to financial institutions subject 
to minimum prudential standards and supervision by a financial regulatory agency 
(“regulated financial institutions”) with total assets greater than or equal to USD 100 billion 
(or equivalent), and financial institutions which are not subject to minimum prudential 
standards and supervision by a financial regulatory agency (“unregulated financial 
institutions”), a Reporting Bank must calculate Kcorp, Kbank and Ksl using the following 
formula: 
 
Correlation (R_FI) = 1.25 × [0.12 × 
(1−𝑒−50 ×𝑃𝐷)
(1−𝑒−50)
+ 0.24 × (1 −

(1−1.5×𝑏)
 
 
 
For the purposes of determining whether the USD 100 billion (or equivalent) total assets 
threshold is met, the Reporting Bank must use the reported total assets of the consolidated 
group of companies which include the regulated financial institution. The reported total 
assets figure must be taken from the most recent audited financial statements. 
 
 
7.4.64  
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.63 –  
 
(a) 
“financial institution” refers to an entity specified in Annex 2A, a collective 
investment scheme or a closed-end fund; and 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-91  
(b) 
the Authority may from time to time specify any entity or group of entities 
as unregulated financial institutions. 
 
 
Calculation of Ksm 
 
7.4.65 
A Reporting Bank must calculate Ksm for an IRBA exposure in the corporate 
small business asset sub-class using the following formula: 
 
Correlation (R) =  0.12 × 
(1−𝑒−50 ×𝑃𝐷)
(1−𝑒−50)
+ 0.24  × (1 − 
(1−𝑒−50 ×𝑃𝐷)

(1−1.5×𝑏)
 
 
 
where “S” refers to total reported annual revenue, or reported total assets 
where a Reporting Bank has included an IRBA exposure to an obligor in the 
corporate small business sub-class pursuant to paragraph 7.4.45, of the obligor 
(calculated in millions of Singapore dollars), or if the obligor is part of a 
consolidated group, of the consolidated group. Where the reported annual 
revenue figure or reported total assets figure, as the case may be, is less than 
S$10 million, the Reporting Bank must apply S = 10 for the purposes of 
calculating Ksm. Where the Reporting Bank is not permitted to use the total 
reported annual revenue or reported total assets of the obligor in the Ksm 
formula in accordance with paragraph 7.4.44 or 7.4.47, the Reporting Bank 
must apply S = 100 for the purposes of calculating Ksm. The adjustment of 
0.04 × (1 − 
(𝑆−10)
90 ) is referred to as the “firm-size adjustment”.  
 
Illustrative risk weights are set out in Annex 7AA. 
 
7.4.66 
Despite paragraph 7.4.65, for all IRBA exposures to regulated financial 
institutions with total assets greater than or equal to USD 100 billion (or equivalent) and 
unregulated financial institutions, a Reporting Bank must calculate Ksm using the following 
formula:  
 
Correlation (R_FI) = 1.25 × [0.12 × 
(1−𝑒−50 ×𝑃𝐷)
(1−𝑒−50)
+ 0.24 × (1 −

(1−1.5×𝑏)
 
 
 
For the purposes of determining whether the USD 100 billion (or equivalent) total assets 
threshold is met, the Reporting Bank must use the reported total assets of the consolidated 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-92  
group of companies which include the regulated financial institution. The reported total 
assets figure must be taken from the most recent audited financial statements. 
 
 
7.4.67  
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.66 –  
 
(a) 
“financial institution” refers to an entity specified in Annex 2A, a collective 
investment scheme or a closed-end fund; and 
 
(b) 
the Authority may from time to time specify any entity or group of entities 
as unregulated financial institutions. 
 
 
Calculation of Khv 
 
7.4.68 
A Reporting Bank must calculate Khv for an IRBA exposure in the HVCRE asset 
sub-class using the following formula: 
 
Correlation (R) = 
0.12 × 
(1−𝑒−50 ×𝑃𝐷)
(1−𝑒−50)
+ 0.30 × (1 − 
(1− 𝑒−50 ×𝑃𝐷)
(1−𝑒−50)
)

(1+(𝑀−2.5)×𝑏)
(1−1.5×𝑏)
 
 
7.4.69 
Where Kcorp, Ksm, Ksov, Kbank, Ksl or Khv for any IRBA exposure calculated in 
accordance with paragraphs 7.4.62 to 7.4.68 is less than zero, the Reporting Bank must 
apply K = 0 for the purposes of calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for 
that IRBA exposure pursuant to Sub-division 4 or 5 of Division 1 of this Part. 
 
 
Probability of Default, PD 
 
7.4.70 
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.4.62 to 7.4.68, PD of an exposure in the IRBA 
wholesale asset class refers to the PD associated with the obligor grade to which the IRBA 
exposure is assigned and estimated in accordance with Annex 7X. PD is measured as a 
decimal. 
 
7.4.71 
For the purposes of calculating Kcorp, Ksm, Kbank, Ksl and Khv pursuant to 
paragraphs 7.4.62 to 7.4.68, the Reporting Bank must apply PD = 0.0005 where the PD 
is less than 0.0005.  
 
 
 
Loss Given Default, LGD 
 
7.4.72 
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.4.62 to 7.4.68, LGD of an exposure in the 
IRBA wholesale asset class refers to the LGD associated with the facility grade to which 
the IRBA exposure is assigned and estimated in accordance with Annex 7X, or where 
applicable LGD* calculated in accordance with paragraphs 7.4.75 to 7.4.79, subject to 
paragraphs 7.4.73, 7.4.74 and 7.4.80. LGD, or where applicable LGD*, is measured as a 
decimal. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-93  
 
7.4.73 
 For an IRBA exposure for which the Reporting Bank is using the F-IRBA to 
calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount and where the IRBA exposure is not 
secured by any eligible financial collateral or eligible IRBA collateral, a Reporting Bank 
must apply the following in the calculation of LGD for the purposes of calculating Kcorp, Ksm, 
Ksov, Kbank, Ksl and Khv pursuant to paragraphs 7.4.62 to 7.4.68:   
 
(a) 
if the exposure is expressly subordinated to another facility, assign a LGD 
of 0.75;  
 
(b) 
in any other case – 
 
(i) 
assign a LGD of 0.45 for the following exposures:  
 
(A) exposures categorised in the sovereign asset sub-class in 
paragraph 7.4.42(c) or bank asset sub-class in paragraph 
7.4.42(d);  
 
(B) exposures to any financial institution, including exposures to 
securities 
firms 
and 
insurance 
companies, 
which 
are 
categorised in the general corporate asset sub-class in 
paragraph 7.4.42(a) or corporate small business asset sub-
class in paragraph 7.4.42(b); and 
 
(ii) 
assign a LGD of 0.4 for any other exposures.  
 
7.4.74 
A Reporting Bank must use either of the following for CCR exposures (other 
than any exposure to a CCP arising from a CCR exposure) that are categorised under the 
IRBA wholesale asset class: 
 
(a) 
the values of LGD, as applicable, set out in paragraph 7.4.73, in the case 
where the Reporting Bank is using the F-IRBA;  
 
(b) 
estimates of LGD without recognising the effects of CRM, in the case where 
the Reporting Bank is using the A-IRBA. 
 
7.4.75 
For an IRBA exposure for which the Reporting Bank is using the F-IRBA to 
calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount, and where the Reporting Bank has 
taken eligible financial collateral or eligible IRBA collateral for the IRBA exposure and 
recognises the effect of CRM of such collateral, the Reporting Bank must calculate LGD*, 
which is the LGD applicable to a collateralised transaction, as the exposure weighted 
average of the LGD applicable to the unsecured portion of an exposure and the LGD 
applicable to the secured portion of the exposure. The Reporting Bank must calculate LGD*, 
as follows:  
 
LGD* = LGDU x 
𝐸 (1+ 𝐻𝐸)− 𝐶(1−𝐻𝐶−𝐻𝐹𝑋) 
𝐸 (1+ 𝐻𝐸)
 + LGDS x 
𝐶(1−𝐻𝐶−𝐻𝐹𝑋)

A Reporting Bank must not recognise the effects of CRM of a junior charge on 
an eligible CRE or eligible RRE unless –  
 
(a) 
all the senior charges ranking above the junior charge in question are held 
by one or more of the following persons: 
 
(i)  
the Reporting Bank;  
 
(ii)  CPF;  
 
(iii)  HDB; and 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-95  
(b)  there is no doubt that the junior charge is legally enforceable and 
constitutes an efficient credit risk mitigant.   
 
7.4.78 
A Reporting Bank which recognises the effects of CRM of a junior charge on an 
eligible CRE or eligible RRE, taken for an IRBA exposure (other than an exposure that is 
expressly subordinated to another facility) categorised under the IRBA wholesale asset 
class for which the Reporting Bank is using the F-IRBA to calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount, must apply the following treatment for the purposes of calculating LGD* 
in accordance with paragraph 7.4.75:  
 
(a) 
C(1 – HC – HFX) must be reduced by the sum of all loans with charges 
(including principal and accrued interest) that rank higher than the junior 
charge on the eligible CRE or eligible RRE. In cases where there are 
charges held by third parties that rank pari passu with the charge held by 
the Reporting Bank, C(1 – HC – HFX) must be further reduced based on the 
proportion of the collateral that is attributable to the Reporting Bank;  
 
(b)  E must be calculated as the sum of fair value of all the exposures secured 
by all the junior and senior charges held by the Reporting Bank on the 
eligible CRE or eligible RRE.  
 
7.4.79 
Where a Reporting Bank has taken a mix of eligible financial collateral and 
eligible IRBA collateral, including different types of eligible IRBA collateral, for an IRBA 
exposure categorised under the IRBA wholesale asset class for which it is using the F-IRBA 
to calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount, the Reporting Bank may recognise 
the effects of CRM of the eligible financial collateral and eligible IRBA collateral. To 
recognise the effects of CRM, the Reporting Bank must recognise each individual type of 
collateral sequentially beginning with the type of collateral with the lowest LGD and 
haircuts, and reduce the unsecured portion of the IRBA exposure by the adjusted value of 
the type of the collateral for which the effects of CRM is recognised, and therefore calculate 
LGD* as follows: 
 
LGD* = LGDU x

7.4.80 
For an IRBA exposure for which a Reporting Bank is using the A-IRBA to 
calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount, and for the purposes of calculating 
Kcorp, Ksm, Ksl and Khv pursuant to paragraphs 7.4.62 to 7.4.68 and calculating EL amount 
in paragraph 7.4.132, –  
 
(a) 
where a Reporting Bank has taken collateral for an IRBA exposure which 
is fully secured by the collateral (i.e. the value of the collateral after 
haircuts exceeds the EAD calculated in accordance with Division 2 of this 
Part), the Reporting Bank must apply –  
 
(i) 
LGD =  
0.1, where the LGD is less than 0.1 for the portion of the 
 
 
IRBA exposure secured by eligible receivables, eligible 
 
 
CRE or eligible RRE; and  
 
(ii) 
LGD = 
0.15 where the LGD is less than 0.15 for the portion of the 
IRBA exposure secured by other eligible physical collateral. 
 
To avoid doubt,   
 
(A)  the Reporting Bank need not apply any floor to the LGD for the 
portion of the IRBA exposure secured by eligible financial collateral; 
and  
 
(B)  where the collateral consist of a mix of collateral, the Reporting Bank 
must calculate the floor applicable by recognising each individual 
type of collateral sequentially beginning with the type of collateral 
with the lowest floor to the LGD i.e. reduce the unsecured portion of 
the IRBA exposure by the value of the collateral after haircuts for 
eligible financial collateral, followed by eligible receivables, eligible 
CRE or eligible RRE, and other eligible physical collateral; 
 
(b) 
where a Reporting Bank has not taken any eligible financial collateral or 
eligible IRBA collateral for an IRBA exposure, the Reporting Bank must 
apply LGD = 0.25 where the LGD is less than 0.25; and 
 
(c) 
where a Reporting Bank has taken collateral for an IRBA exposure which 
is not fully secured by the collateral (i.e. the value of the collateral after 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-97  
haircuts does not equal to or exceed the EAD calculated in accordance with 
Division 2 of this Part) –   
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank may apply paragraph 7.4.75 or 7.4.79 to 
calculate LGD* for the IRBA exposure, but for the unsecured portion, 
substitute LGD estimated by the Reporting Bank for the unsecured 
exposure, for LGDU, provided that all of the following conditions are 
met: 
 
(A) the Reporting Bank meets the minimum requirements for 
estimating LGD in accordance with Annex 7X for the unsecured 
portion of an exposure; 
 
(B) the Reporting Bank does not have sufficient data for estimating 
LGD to meet the minimum requirements in paragraph 1.3(b) of 
Annex 7W for the secured portion of the exposure; 
   
(C)  the exposure is secured by eligible financial collateral or eligible 
IRBA collateral; 
 
(D)  LGD estimated by the Reporting Bank for the unsecured portion 
does not incorporate any effect of collateral recovery; and  
 
(ii) 
in all other cases, the Reporting Bank must calculate LGD flrPS, which 
is the LGD floor applicable to a collateralised transaction, as the 
exposure-weighted average of the LGD floor applicable to the 
unsecured portion of the exposure and the LGD floor applicable to 
the secured portion of the exposure. The Reporting Bank must 
calculate LGD flrPS as follows:  
 
LGD flrPS = LGD flrU x 
𝐸 (1+ 𝐻𝐸)− 𝐶(1−𝐻𝐶−𝐻𝐹𝑋) 
𝐸 (1+ 𝐻𝐸)
 + LGD flrS x 
𝐶(1−𝐻𝐶−𝐻𝐹𝑋)
𝐸 (1+ 𝐻𝐸)  
 
where –  
 
(A) LGD flrU  =   0.25;   
 
(B)   E            = fair value of the exposure of the transaction, as 
though no collateral was taken, calculated in 
accordance with Division 2 of this Part;  
 
(C)   HE           =  haircut applicable to cash lent or the type of 
securities lent or posted as set out in Table 7J-1 
and paragraph 2.3 of Annex 7J, subject to 
paragraph 2.5 of Annex 7J;   
 
(D)   C            =  fair value of the collateral received;   
 
(E)   HC  
=   haircut appropriate to the collateral received as 
set out in Table 7J-1, subject to paragraph 2.5 of 
Annex 7J, in the case of eligible financial collateral,

(G)   LGD flrS  =  0 where the IRBA exposure is secured by eligible 
financial collateral, 0.1 where the IRBA exposure 
is secured by eligible receivables, eligible CRE or 
eligible RRE, 0.15 where the IRBA exposure is 
secured by other eligible physical collateral, or 
0.25 in the case of any other collateral. Where a 
Reporting Bank has taken a mix of collateral, the 
Reporting Bank must calculate LGD flrS as the 
weighted average of the floor applicable to each 
type of collateral based on the C(1 – HC – HFX) 
specific to the collateral; and 
 
(H) C(1 – HC – HFX) is capped at E(1 + HE),   
 
and apply LGD = LGD flrPS, where the LGD is less than LGD flrPS.  
 
 
Effective Maturity, M 
 
7.4.81 
A Reporting Bank must calculate M in accordance with Annex 7V. 
 
 
Sub-division 9: Calculation of K for IRBA Retail Asset Class  
 
 
Calculation of Kmort 
  
7.4.82 
A Reporting Bank must calculate Kmort for an IRBA exposure in the residential 
mortgage asset sub-class using the following formula:  
 
 
Correlation (R) = 0.15 
 
Capital requirement (Kmort)  
=  [𝐿𝐺𝐷 × 𝑁 [

√(1−𝑅) + √
𝑅
1−𝑅× 𝐺(0.999)] −𝑃𝐷 × 𝐿𝐺𝐷] 
 
Illustrative risk weights are set out in Annex 7AA. 
 
7.4.83 
Despite paragraph 7.4.82, for an IRBA exposure in the residential mortgage 
asset sub-class where the exposure is to an obligor who has mortgaged more than 2 non-
owner occupied residential property units to a Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank must 
calculate Kmort using the following formula if the Reporting Bank has assessed that the 
servicing of the exposure and prospects for recovery in the event of default materially 
depend on the cash flows generated by the residential property securing the exposure 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-99  
rather than on the underlying capacity of the obligor to service the exposure from other 
sources:  
 
Correlation (R) = 0.12 × 
(1−𝑒−50 ×𝑃𝐷)
(1−𝑒−50)
+ 0.24 × (1 − 
(1− 𝑒−50 ×𝑃𝐷)
(1−𝑒−50)

(1+(𝑀−2.5)×𝑏)
(1−1.5×𝑏)
  
 
Illustrative risk weights are set out in Annex 7AA. 
 
To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must calculate Kmort under paragraph 7.4.82 for an 
exposure secured by a residential property that is owner-occupied and is the obligor’s 
primary residence.  
 
7.4.84 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.83 – 
 
(a) 
where the obligor has mortgaged more than one residential property units 
to a Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank must count only up to one 
residential property unit as owner-occupied, and count any mortgages on 
other residential property units as mortgages on non-owner occupied 
residential property units; and  
 
(b) 
a Reporting Bank must calculate M in accordance to paragraph 1.1 or 5.1 
of Annex 7V. 
 
 
 
Calculation of Kqrre 
 
7.4.85 
A Reporting Bank must calculate Kqrre for an IRBA exposure in the QRRE asset 
sub-class using the following formula:  
 
Correlation (R) = 0.04 
 
Capital requirement (Kqrre)  
= [𝐿𝐺𝐷 × 𝑁 [ 
𝐺(𝑃𝐷)
√(1−𝑅) + √

Illustrative risk weights are set out in Annex 7AA. 
 
 
 
Calculation of Koret  
 
7.4.86 
A Reporting Bank must calculate Koret for an IRBA exposure in the other retail 
exposures asset sub-class using the following formula: 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-100  
Correlation (R) = 0.03 × 
(1− 𝑒−35 ×𝑃𝐷)
(1− 𝑒−35)
+ 0.16 × (1 −

Illustrative risk weights are set out in Annex 7AA. 
 
 
Probability of Default, PD 
 
7.4.87 
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.4.82 to 7.4.86, PD of an exposure in the IRBA 
retail asset class refers to the PD associated with the pool of exposures to which the IRBA 
exposure is assigned and estimated in accordance with Annex 7X. PD is measured as a 
decimal. 
 
7.4.88 
For the purposes of calculating Kmort pursuant to paragraphs 7.4.82 to 7.4.84, 
and Koret pursuant to paragraph 7.4.86, a Reporting Bank must apply PD = 0.0005 where 
the PD is less than 0.0005. For the purposes of calculating Kqrre pursuant to paragraph 
7.4.85, the Reporting Bank must apply PD = 0.0005 where the PD is less than 0.0005 for 
a QRRE transactor and PD = 0.001 where the PD is less than 0.001 for a QRRE revolver.  
 
 
 
Loss Given Default, LGD 
 
7.4.89 
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.4.82 to 7.4.86, LGD of an exposure in the 
IRBA retail asset class refers to the LGD associated with the pool of exposures to which 
the IRBA exposure is assigned and estimated in accordance with Annex 7X. LGD is 
measured as a decimal. 
 
7.4.90 
For the purposes of calculating Kmort pursuant to paragraphs 7.4.82 to 7.4.84, 
a Reporting Bank must apply LGD = 0.1 where the LGD is less than 0.1. To avoid doubt, 
the Reporting Bank must apply the LGD floor irrespective of the level of collateral provided 
by the residential property. Regardless of whether the Reporting Bank applies the LGD 
floor, the Reporting Bank must comply with the requirements on LGD estimation as set 
out in Annex 7X. 
 
7.4.91 
For the purposes of calculating Kqrre pursuant to paragraph 7.4.85, the 
Reporting Bank must apply LGD = 0.5 where the LGD is less than 0.5.   
 
7.4.92 
For the purposes of calculating Koret pursuant to paragraph 7.4.86 –  
  
(a) 
where a Reporting Bank has taken collateral for an IRBA exposure which 
is fully secured by the collateral (i.e. the value of the collateral after 
haircuts exceeds the EAD calculated in accordance with Division 2 of this 
Part), the Reporting Bank must apply –  
 
(i) 
LGD =  
0.1 where the LGD is less than 0.1 for the portion of the 
 
IRBA 
exposure 
secured 
by 
eligible 
receivables, 
 
eligible CRE or eligible RRE; and  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-101  
 
(ii) 
LGD =  
0.15 where the LGD is less than 0.15 for the portion 
 
 
secured by other eligible physical collateral.  
 
To avoid doubt –   
 
(A)  the Reporting Bank need not apply any floor to LGD for the portion 
of the IRBA exposure secured by eligible financial collateral; and 
 
(B)  where the collateral consists of a mix of collateral, the Reporting 
Bank must calculate the floor applicable by recognising each 
individual type of collateral sequentially beginning with the type of 
collateral with the lowest floor to the LGD i.e. reduce the unsecured 
portion of the IRBA exposure by the value of the collateral after 
haircuts for eligible financial collateral, followed by eligible 
receivables, eligible CRE or eligible RRE, and other eligible physical 
collateral; 
 
(b) 
where a Reporting Bank has not taken any eligible financial collateral or 
eligible IRBA collateral for an IRBA exposure, the Reporting Bank must 
apply LGD = 0.3 where the LGD is less than 0.3; and  
 
(c) 
where a Reporting Bank has taken collateral for an IRBA exposure which 
is not fully secured by the collateral (i.e. the value of the collateral after 
haircuts does not exceed the EAD calculated in accordance with Division 2 
of this Part), the Reporting Bank must calculate LGD flrPS, which is the LGD 
floor applicable to a collateralised transaction, as the exposure-weighted 
average of the LGD floor applicable to the unsecured portion of the 
exposure and the LGD floor applicable to the secured portion of the 
exposure. The Reporting Bank must calculate LGD flrPS as follows:  
 
LGD flrPS = LGD flrU x 
𝐸 (1+ 𝐻𝐸)− 𝐶(1−𝐻𝐶−𝐻𝐹𝑋) 
𝐸 (1+ 𝐻𝐸)
 + LGD flrS x 
𝐶(1−𝐻𝐶−𝐻𝐹𝑋)
𝐸 (1+ 𝐻𝐸)  
 
where –  
 
(i) 
LGD flrU = 
0.3;  
 
(ii) E 
= fair value of the exposure of the transaction, as though 
no collateral was taken, calculated in accordance with 
Division 2 of this Part; 
 
(iii) HE 
= haircut applicable to cash lent or the type of securities 
lent or posted as set out in Table 7J-1 and paragraph 2.3 
of Annex 7J, subject to paragraph 2.5 of Annex 7J;  
 
(iv) C 
= fair value of the collateral received;  
 
(v) HC 
= haircut appropriate to the collateral received as set out 
in Table 7J-1, subject to paragraph 2.5 of Annex 7J, in 
the case of eligible financial collateral, Table 7-23 in the 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-102  
case of eligible IRBA collateral, or 1 in the case of any 
other collateral;  
 
(vi) HFX 
= haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the 
collateral and exposure based on paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5 
of Annex 7J;  
 
(vii) LGD flrS = 0 where the IRBA exposure is secured by eligible financial 
collateral, 0.1 where the IRBA exposure is secured by 
eligible receivables, eligible CRE or eligible RRE, 0.15 
where the IRBA exposure is secured by other eligible 
physical collateral, or 0.3 in the case of any other 
collateral. Where a Reporting Bank has taken a mix of 
collateral, the Reporting Bank must calculate LGD flrS as 
the weighted average of the floor applicable to each type 
of collateral based on the C(1 – HC – HFX) specific to the 
collateral;  
 
(viii) C(1 – HC – HFX) is capped at E(1 + HE);  
 
and apply LGD = LGD flrPS where the LGD is less than LGD flrPS. 
 
 
Sub-division 10: Calculation of K for Eligible Purchased Receivables Asset Class 
 
7.4.93 
A Reporting Bank must calculate Kcp for an IRBA exposure in the purchased 
corporate receivables asset sub-class using the following formula: 
 
 
Kcp  = [Kdf, cp + Kdil, cp] 
 
 
where “Kdf, cp” refers to the capital requirement for the default risk of purchased 
corporate receivables and “Kdil, cp” refers to the capital requirement for the 
dilution risk273 of purchased corporate receivables. A Reporting Bank need not 
calculate Kdil, cp if the Reporting Bank demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Authority that dilution risk is immaterial. 
 
7.4.94 
A Reporting Bank must calculate Ksp for an IRBA exposure in the purchased 
corporate small business receivables asset sub-class using the following formula: 
 
 
Ksp  = [Kdf, sp + Kdil, sp] 
 
 
 
273 
Examples include offsets or allowances arising from returns of goods sold, disputes regarding product 
quality, possible debts of the seller of the receivables to an obligor of the receivables, and any payment or 
promotional discounts offered by the seller of the receivables (e.g. a credit for cash payments within 30 
days). 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-103  
where “Kdf, sp” refers to the capital requirement for the default risk of purchased 
corporate small business receivables and “Kdil, sp” refers to the capital 
requirement for the dilution risk of purchased corporate small business 
receivables. A Reporting Bank need not calculate Kdil, sp if the Reporting Bank 
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Authority that dilution risk is immaterial. 
 
7.4.95 
A Reporting Bank must calculate Krp for an IRBA exposure in the purchased 
retail receivables asset sub-class using the following formula: 
 
 
Krp  = [Kdf, rp + Kdil, rp] 
 
 
where “Kdf, rp” refers to the capital requirement for the default risk of purchased 
retail receivables and “Kdil, rp” refers to the capital requirement for the dilution 
risk of purchased retail receivables. A Reporting Bank need not calculate Kdil, rp 
if the Reporting Bank demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Authority that 
dilution risk is immaterial. 
 
 
Calculation of Capital Requirements for Default Risk, Kdf 
 
7.4.96 
Subject to paragraph 7.4.98, a Reporting Bank must calculate – 
 
(a) 
Kdf, cp by applying the formula set out in paragraph 7.4.62 or 7.4.63 as 
appropriate for all underlying obligors of purchased corporate receivables 
and using the F-IRBA or the A-IRBA as appropriate, subject to the 
Reporting Bank receiving approval to adopt the F-IRBA or the A-IRBA for 
the corporate asset sub-class;  
 
(b) 
Kdf, sp by applying the formula set out in paragraph 7.4.65 or 7.4.66 as 
appropriate for all underlying obligors of purchased corporate small 
business receivables and using the F-IRBA or the A-IRBA as appropriate, 
subject to the Reporting Bank receiving approval to adopt the F-IRBA or 
the A-IRBA for the corporate small business asset sub-class; and 
 
(c) 
Kdf, rp by applying the formula set out in paragraph 7.4.82, 7.4.83, 7.4.85 
or 7.4.86 (depending on whether the purchased receivables meet the 
criteria for categorisation under the residential mortgage asset sub-class, 
QRRE asset sub-class or other retail exposures asset sub-class), subject 
to the Reporting Bank receiving approval to adopt the IRBA for the 
applicable retail asset sub-class. For the purposes of calculating Kdf, rp, a 
Reporting Bank must not have regard to any assumption of recourse or 
guarantees from the seller or other parties if it uses external or internal 
reference data to derive the estimates of PD and LGD. If the purchased 
receivables meet the criteria for categorisation under the residential 
mortgage asset sub-class or QRRE asset sub-class but the Reporting Bank 
has not received approval to adopt the IRBA for those asset sub-classes, 
the Reporting Bank must calculate Kdf, rp by applying the formula set out 
in paragraph 7.4.86, subject to the Reporting Bank receiving approval to 
adopt the IRBA for the other retail exposures asset sub-class. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-104  
7.4.97 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.96, in the case where the purchased 
receivables is a hybrid pool containing a mix of purchased receivables that can be 
categorised under 2 or more asset sub-classes and where a Reporting Bank cannot 
separate the purchased receivables by asset sub-class, the Reporting Bank must apply the 
formula for the asset sub-class that results in the highest Kdf for the purposes of calculating 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the pool pursuant to Sub-division 4 or 5 of 
Division 1 of this Part. 
 
7.4.98 
Subject to approval by the Authority, a Reporting Bank may calculate Kdf, cp and 
Kdf, sp using a top-down approach as set out in Annex 7T. The top-down approach allows 
the Reporting Bank to derive estimates of IRBA parameters on a pooled basis. A Reporting 
Bank seeking approval from the Authority to use the top-down approach must satisfy all 
of the following conditions: 
 
(a) the receivables are purchased from third party sellers, and not from 
related corporations or affiliates of the Reporting Bank, and as such the 
Reporting Bank has not originated the receivables either directly or 
indirectly; 
 
(b) 
the receivables are generated on an arm’s-length basis between the seller 
and the obligor of the receivables. Inter-company accounts receivable and 
receivables subject to contra-accounts274 between firms that buy and sell 
to each other are not eligible for the top-down treatment; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank has a claim on all proceeds from the pool of receivables 
or a pro rata interest in the proceeds. The existence of full or partial 
recourse to the seller is allowed as long as the cash flows from the 
purchased receivables are the primary protection against default risk as 
determined in accordance with paragraphs 2.10 to 2.15 of Annex 7T and 
the Reporting Bank meets the eligibility criteria in this Sub-division and 
Annex 7T, and the operational requirements in Section 2 of Annex 7T;   
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Authority that 
the pool of receivables is sufficiently diversified;  
 
(e) 
the Reporting Bank has earmarked the purchased receivables for 
securitisation or sale to be completed within 6 months from the date of 
purchase;  
 
(f) 
the Reporting Bank meets the requirements in Annex 7T. 
 
7.4.99 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.98(c), where a Reporting Bank has a claim 
on tranches of the proceeds275, it must apply the treatment in Sub-division 7 of Division 1 
of this Part and Division 6 of this Part, for securitisation exposures.  
 
7.4.100 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.4.98(d), in assessing whether to grant 
approval for a Reporting Bank to use the top-down approach as set out in Annex 7T, the 
 
274  
Contra-accounts involve a customer buying from and selling to the same firm. The risk is that debts may 
be settled through payments in kind rather than cash. Invoices between the companies may be offset 
against each other instead of being paid. This practice can defeat a security interest when challenged in 
court. 
275  
Claims on tranches refer to first loss position, second loss position, etc. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-105  
Authority will consider, among other things, whether there is concentration in any single 
receivable or group of receivables (to a group of underlying obligors or guaranteed by the 
same seller) that is more than 3.5% of the EAD of the pool of purchased corporate 
receivables or purchased corporate small business receivables. To avoid doubt, this does 
not preclude the Authority from applying additional concentration limits. 
 
7.4.101 
If a Reporting Bank fails to comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 
7.4.98 after approval has been granted for it to adopt the top-down approach, the 
Authority may revoke its approval for the Reporting Bank to use the top-down approach, 
in which case the Reporting Bank must calculate Kdf, cp, Kdf, sp or both in accordance with 
paragraphs 7.4.96 and 7.4.97. Actions taken by the Authority may include subjecting the 
Reporting Bank to higher bank-specific capital requirements pursuant to section 10(3) of 
the Banking Act. 
 
 
Calculation of Capital Requirements for Dilution Risk, Kdil 
 
7.4.102 
A Reporting Bank must calculate Kdil, cp, Kdil, sp and Kdil, rp, regardless of whether 
it is using the top-down approach, using the following formula: 
 
Correlation (Rdil) = 
0.12 × 
(1−𝑒−50 ×𝑃𝐷𝑑𝑖𝑙)
(1−𝑒−50)
+ 0.24 × (1 − 
(1− 𝑒−50 ×𝑃𝐷𝑑𝑖𝑙)
(1−𝑒−50)
) 
 
 
 
Maturity adjustment (b) = [0.11852 −0.05478 × ln(𝑃𝐷𝑑𝑖𝑙)]2 
 
Capital requirement (Kdil, cp , Kdil, sp or Kdil, rp)  
= [𝐿𝐺𝐷𝑑𝑖𝑙 × 𝑁[
𝐺(𝑃𝐷𝑑𝑖𝑙)
√(1−𝑅𝑑𝑖𝑙) + √
𝑅𝑑𝑖𝑙
1−𝑅𝑑𝑖𝑙× 𝐺(0.999)] −𝑃𝐷𝑑𝑖𝑙× 𝐿𝐺𝐷𝑑𝑖𝑙] × 
(1+(𝑀𝑑𝑖𝑙−2.5)×𝑏)
(1−1.5×𝑏)
 
 
 
where – 
 
(a) 
“PDdil” refers to the estimated one-year EL arising from dilution risk 
expressed as a percentage of the amount of receivables in the relevant 
pool. A Reporting Bank may use external and internal reference data to 
derive the estimate of EL. The Reporting Bank must calculate the estimate 
without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the 
seller or other parties; 
 
(b) 
LGDdil = 100%; and 
 
(c) 
“Mdil” is – 
 
(i) 
the average effective maturity calculated in accordance with Annex 
7V for the relevant pool of receivables; or 
 
(ii) 
one year if the Reporting Bank demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
the Authority that the Reporting Bank is able to monitor the dilution 
risk and has a track record of resolving incidents of dilution or dilution 
events within one year. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-106  
7.4.103 
Where Kdil, cp, Kdil, sp or Kdil, rp for any IRBA exposure calculated in accordance 
with paragraph 7.4.102 is less than zero, the Reporting Bank must apply Kdil = 0 for the 
purposes of calculating Kcp, Ksp or Krp, as the case may be, for that IRBA exposure pursuant 
to paragraph 7.4.93, 7.4.94 or 7.4.95.  
 
7.4.104 
Subject to approval by the Authority, a Reporting Bank may calculate Kdil, cp, 
Kdil, sp and Kdil, rp using a top-down approach which allows the Reporting Bank to derive 
estimates of IRBA parameters on a pooled basis. A Reporting Bank seeking approval from 
the Authority to use the top-down approach must satisfy the conditions set out in 
paragraph 7.4.98.  
 
7.4.105 
If a Reporting Bank fails to comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 
7.4.104 after approval has been granted for it to adopt the top-down approach, the 
Authority may revoke its approval for the Reporting Bank to use the top-down approach. 
The Reporting Bank may also be subjected to higher bank-specific capital requirements 
pursuant to section 10(3) of the Banking Act, or other actions by the Authority. 
 
 
 
Treatment of purchase price discounts for receivables 
 
7.4.106 
Where the purchase price of the purchased receivables reflect a discount that 
provides first loss protection for default losses, dilution losses or both, and a portion of 
such a purchase price discount is to be refunded to the seller based on the performance 
of the receivables – 
 
(a)   a Reporting Bank which has purchased the receivables may treat the 
amount to be refunded as first loss protection and may calculate the 
capital requirements for the purchased receivables in accordance with 
Sub-divisions 4 to 7 of Division 6 of this Part; and  
 
(b)   a Reporting Bank which has sold the receivables and provided the 
refundable purchase price discount must treat the refundable amount as 
a first loss position and must calculate the capital requirements for the 
purchase price discount in accordance with Division 6 of this Part.   
 
7.4.107  Non-refundable purchase price discounts for receivables do not affect either the 
EL provision calculation in Sub-division 14 of this Division or the calculation of credit risk-
weighted exposure amounts.  
 
7.4.108 
Where collateral or partial guarantees obtained on the purchased receivables 
provide first loss protection, and these collateral or partial guarantees cover default losses, 
dilution losses or both, a Reporting Bank may treat them as first loss protection, and may 
calculate the capital requirements for the purchased receivables in accordance with 
Division 6 of this Part. When the collateral or partial guarantees cover both default losses 
and dilution losses, a Reporting Bank using the SEC-IRBA must calculate the exposure-
weighted average LGD in accordance with paragraph 7.6.39.

Sub-division 11: Treatment of Credit Protection 
 
Treatment of Eligible Credit Protection Bought  
 
7.4.109 
A Reporting Bank which has bought eligible credit protection for an IRBA 
exposure categorised under the IRBA wholesale asset class for which it is using the F-IRBA 
to calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount may recognise the effects of CRM 
of the eligible credit protection as follows: 
 
(a) 
break down the IRBA exposure into – 
 
(i) 
a protected portion with EAD equal to the notional amount of the 
eligible credit protection, subject to any adjustments due to a 
currency mismatch or a maturity mismatch set out in Annex 7H; and 
 
(ii) 
an unprotected portion with EAD equal to the EAD of the IRBA 
exposure, less the notional amount of the eligible credit protection 
adjusted for any currency mismatch or maturity mismatch set out in 
Annex 7H; and 
 
(b) 
calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount pursuant to Sub-
division 4 or 5 of Division 1 of this Part as follows: 
 
(i) 
for the protected portion – 
 
(A) use all of the following: 
 
(I)  the formula for calculating K that is applicable to the 
eligible protection provider; 
 
(II) the PD associated with the obligor grade to which the 
eligible protection provider is assigned that is estimated 
in accordance with Annex 7X;  
 
(III) the LGD of the underlying transaction or the LGD 
applicable to the eligible credit protection taking into 
account seniority and any collateralisation of the credit 
protection276; or 
 
(B) in the case where the Reporting Bank is using the SA(CR) for 
direct exposures to the eligible protection provider, apply the 
scope of eligible protection providers under the SA(CR) and 
apply the risk weight under the SA(CR) to the eligible protection 
provider; and 
 
(ii) 
for the unprotected portion, use all of the following: 
 
 
276  
For example, where a Reporting Bank has a subordinated claim on the obligor but the eligible credit 
protection represents a senior claim on the eligible protection provider, the Reporting Bank may use an 
LGD applicable for a senior claim in accordance with paragraph 7.4.73(b). 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-108  
(A) the formula for calculating K that is applicable to the underlying 
obligor; 
 
(B) the PD associated with the obligor grade to which the 
underlying obligor is assigned and estimated in accordance with 
Annex 7X;  
 
(C) the LGD of the underlying transaction. 
 
7.4.110 
A Reporting Bank which has bought eligible credit protection for an IRBA 
exposure for which it is using the A-IRBA or the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class to 
calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount may recognise the effects of CRM of 
the eligible credit protection as follows:   
 
(a) 
in the case where the Reporting Bank is using the SA(CR) for direct 
exposures to the eligible protection provider recognised in accordance with 
paragraph 5.8(c) of Annex 7X, the Reporting Bank must –  
 
(i) 
break down the IRBA exposure into a protected portion in accordance 
with the treatment set out in paragraph 7.3.112(a)(i) and an 
unprotected portion in accordance with the treatment set out in 
paragraph 7.3.112(a)(ii);  
 
(ii) 
apply the risk weight applicable under the SA(CR) to the eligible 
protection provider to the protected portion of the IRBA exposure; 
and  
 
(iii) apply the treatment set out in paragraph 7.4.109(b)(ii) for the 
unprotected portion of the IRBA exposure. The Reporting Bank must 
not recognise the effects of CRM of the eligible credit protection in 
its estimates of PD and LGD for the unprotected portion of the IRBA 
exposure; 
 
(b) 
in the case where the Reporting Bank is using the F-IRBA for direct 
exposures to the eligible protection provider recognised in accordance with 
paragraph 5.8(d) of Annex 7X, the Reporting Bank must –  
 
(i) 
break down the IRBA exposure into a protected portion in accordance 
with the treatment set out in paragraph 7.4.109(a)(i) and an 
unprotected portion in accordance with the treatment set out in 
paragraph 7.4.109(a)(ii);  
 
(ii) 
apply the treatment set out in paragraph 7.4.109(b)(i)(A) for the 
protected portion; and  
 
(iii) apply the treatment set out in paragraph 7.4.109(b)(ii) for the 
unprotected portion of the IRBA exposure. The Reporting Bank must 
not recognise the effects of CRM of the eligible credit protection in 
its estimates of PD and LGD for the unprotected portion of the IRBA 
exposure; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-109  
(c) 
in all other cases, the Reporting Bank must either – 
 
(i) 
adopt the treatment set out in paragraph 7.4.109. For the purposes 
of this sub-paragraph, where the protection provider or the 
underlying obligor belongs to the IRBA retail asset class, the 
Reporting Bank must – 
 
(A)  in the case where the protection provider belongs to the IRBA 
retail asset class, substitute “the PD associated with the pool to 
which the protection provider is assigned”, for “the PD 
associated with the obligor grade to which the protection 
provider is assigned” in paragraph 7.4.109(b)(i)(A)(II); and 
 
(B)  in the case where the underlying obligor belongs to the IRBA 
retail asset class, substitute “the PD associated with the pool to 
which the underlying obligor is assigned”, for “the PD 
associated with the obligor grade to which the underlying 
obligor is assigned” in paragraph 7.4.109(b)(ii)(B); or 
 
(ii) 
adjust either its estimates of PD or LGD. The Reporting Bank must 
ensure that any adjustments to estimates of PD or LGD – 
 
(A) are done in a consistent manner for a given type of credit 
protection; and 
 
(B) do not recognise the effect of double default. To avoid doubt, 
the adjusted credit risk-weighted exposure amount must not 
be less than the credit risk-weighted exposure amount had the 
exposure been a direct exposure to the eligible protection 
provider. 
 
7.4.111 
Despite paragraphs 7.4.109(b) and 7.4.110, a Reporting Bank must apply a 
1250% risk weight to an IRBA exposure below a materiality threshold for which no 
payment will be made by the protection provider in the event of loss on the IRBA exposure 
as such an exposure is equivalent to a retained first loss position.  
 
7.4.112 
To avoid doubt, for the purposes of determining the PD and LGD applicable for 
the protected portion in paragraphs 7.4.109(b)(i), 7.4.110(b)(ii), and 7.4.110(c)(i), where 
the eligible protection provider is an entity belonging to the sovereign asset sub-class, the 
Reporting Bank must not apply the values of PD and LGD set out in paragraphs 7.4.71, 
7.4.80(b), 7.4.88, 7.4.90, 7.4.91 and 7.4.92(b). 
 
7.4.113 
A Reporting Bank must apply the relevant provisions in Annex 7I for the 
purposes of determining the protected portion in cases of proportional cover, principal-
only cover, partially eligible credit derivatives, tranched cover and basket credit derivatives. 
 
7.4.114 
In the case of an IRBA exposure within the IRBA eligible purchased receivables 
asset class, a Reporting Bank must consider the availability of credit protection for default 
risk and dilution risk separately. For this purpose –  
 
(a) 
if a guarantee covers both default risk and dilution risk, the Reporting 
Bank must substitute the capital requirement for an exposure to the 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-110  
guarantor for the total capital requirement for default risk and dilution risk 
applicable to the pool of receivables; 
 
(b) 
if a guarantee covers only default risk or dilution risk, but not both, a 
Reporting Bank must substitute the capital requirement for an exposure 
to the guarantor for the capital requirement for the corresponding risk 
component that is covered (default risk or dilution risk), and aggregate 
this capital requirement with the capital requirement for the other 
component; and 
 
(c) 
if a guarantee covers only a portion of the default risk or dilution risk, the 
Reporting Bank must aggregate the capital requirements of the uncovered 
portion with the capital requirement of the covered portion. 
 
 
Treatment of Credit Protection Sold 
 
7.4.115 
A Reporting Bank which has sold unfunded credit protection acquires exposure 
to the reference asset. If such exposure is an IRBA exposure, the Reporting Bank must 
calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the exposure pursuant to Sub-
division 4 of Division 1 of this Part using the formula for calculating K that is applicable to 
the obligor of the reference asset. 
 
7.4.116 
If the unfunded credit protection has more than one reference asset, the credit 
risk-weighted exposure amount for the credit protection is the sum of the credit risk-
weighted exposure amounts in respect of each reference asset calculated using the 
relevant formulae for calculating K that are applicable to the obligors of the respective 
reference assets.   
 
7.4.117 
A Reporting Bank which has sold funded credit protection acquires exposure to 
both the reference asset and the protection buyer. If such exposures are IRBA exposures, 
the Reporting Bank must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the credit 
protection as the sum of – 
 
(a) 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the exposure to the 
reference asset calculated in accordance with paragraphs 7.4.115 and 
7.4.116, as applicable; and   
 
(b) 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the exposure to the 
protection buyer, using –  
 
(i) 
EAD = the carrying amount of the collateral placed with the 
protection buyer; and 
 
(ii) the formula for calculating K that is applicable to the protection buyer.  
 
7.4.118 
The capital requirement for the credit protection calculated in accordance with 
paragraphs 7.4.116 and 7.4.117 must not exceed the notional amount of the credit 
protection, i.e. the maximum possible payout under the credit protection. 
 
7.4.119 
Where a Reporting Bank has provided credit protection (whether funded or 
unfunded) through a proportionate structure, i.e. where the maximum possible payout in 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-111  
respect of any particular reference asset is capped at a pre-determined proportion of the 
notional amount of the credit protection, the Reporting Bank must distinguish individual 
sub-exposures equal to the proportionate amount of credit protection in respect of each 
reference asset for the purposes of calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
applicable to the credit protection sold. 
 
7.4.120 
Where a Reporting Bank has provided credit protection for a basket of reference 
exposures through a first-to-default credit derivative, the Reporting Bank must calculate 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount applicable to the credit protection sold by 
aggregating the risk weights that would be assigned to the reference exposures, subject 
to a cap of 1250%, and multiplying the aggregate with the nominal amount of the 
protection provided by the credit derivative.  
 
7.4.121 
Where a Reporting Bank has provided credit protection for a basket of reference 
exposures through a nth-to-default credit derivative, the Reporting Bank must calculate 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount applicable to the credit protection sold by 
applying the treatment referred to in paragraph 7.4.120, except that in aggregating the 
risk weights, the risk weights assigned to the n-1 assets in the basket of reference 
exposures with the lowest credit risk-weighted exposure amount may be excluded. 
 
 
Sub-division 12:  Calculation of K for Defaulted Assets 
 
7.4.122 
A Reporting Bank must calculate Kdef using the following formula:  
 
 
Capital requirement (Kdef) = LGD - ELest 
 
 
where – 
 
(a) 
“LGD” refers to the LGD for the IRBA exposure; and  
 
(b) 
“ELest” refers to the best estimate of expected loss for that IRBA exposure 
by the Reporting Bank. 
 
A Reporting Bank must use a PD of one for obligors assigned to a default grade. In the 
case where a Reporting Bank is using the F-IRBA for its IRBA exposures under the IRBA 
wholesale asset class, ELest = LGD for the IRBA exposure i.e. Kdef = 0. 
 
7.4.123 
Where Kdef for any IRBA exposure calculated in accordance with paragraph 
7.4.122 is less than zero, a Reporting Bank must apply K = 0 for the purposes of calculating 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for that IRBA exposure pursuant to Sub-division 
4 or 5 of Division 1 of this Part. 
 
 
Sub-division 13:  Supervisory Slotting Criteria  
 
7.4.124 
A Reporting Bank using the supervisory slotting criteria for IRBA exposures 
belonging to the SL asset sub-class or HVCRE asset sub-class or both must assign such 
exposures to internal obligor grades based on its own criteria, systems and processes. The 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-112  
Reporting Bank must then map these internal obligor grades into the supervisory rating 
categories277 in Annex 7S according to the general assessment factors and characteristics 
exhibited by the exposures.  
 
7.4.125   Subject to paragraph 7.4.126, a Reporting Bank which has bought eligible credit 
protection for an IRBA exposure belonging to the SL or HVCRE asset sub-class, for which 
it is using the supervisory slotting criteria to calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure 
amount, may recognise the effects of CRM of the eligible credit protection as follows: 
 
(a)   break down the IRBA exposure into – 
 
(i)   a protected portion with EAD equal to the notional amount of the 
eligible credit protection, subject to any adjustments due to a 
currency mismatch or a maturity mismatch set out in Annex 7H; and 
 
(ii)  an unprotected portion with EAD equal to the EAD of the IRBA 
exposure, less the notional amount of the eligible credit protection 
adjusted for any currency mismatch or maturity mismatch set out in 
Annex 7H;  
 
(b)  calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount pursuant to Sub-
division 4 or Sub-division 5 of Division 1 of this Part follows: 
 
(i)   for the protected portion –  
 
(A)   use all of the following: 
 
(I)  the formula for calculating K that is applicable to the 
eligible protection provider; 
 
(II)  the PD associated with the obligor grade to which the 
eligible protection provider is assigned that is estimated 
in accordance with Annex 7X;   
 
(III) the LGD of the underlying transaction or the LGD 
applicable to the eligible credit protection taking into 
account seniority and any collateralisation of the credit 
protection278; or 
 
(B)  in the case where the Reporting Bank is using the SA(CR) for 
direct exposures to the eligible protection provider, apply the 
scope of eligible protection providers under the SA(CR) and 
 
277  
Each supervisory rating category for IRBA exposures belonging to the SL asset sub-class or the HVCRE 
asset sub-class broadly corresponds to a range of external credit assessments by recognised ECAIs as 
follows: 
(a) “Strong” to “BBB-/Baa3 or better”; 
(b) “Good” to “BB+/Ba1 to BB/Ba2”;  
(c) “Satisfactory” to “BB-/Ba3 to B+/B1”; 
(d) “Weak” to “B/B2 to C-”. 
278  
For example, where a Reporting Bank has a subordinated claim on the obligor but the eligible credit 
protection represents a senior claim on the eligible protection provider, the Reporting Bank may use an 
LGD applicable for a senior claim in accordance with paragraph 7.4.73(b). 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-113  
apply the risk weight applicable under the SA(CR) to the eligible 
protection provider; 
 
(ii) 
for the unprotected portion, apply the risk weight applicable to the 
underlying obligor in accordance with paragraphs 7.4.127 to 7.4.130.  
 
7.4.126  A Reporting Bank may only apply the treatment in paragraph 7.4.125 if the 
Reporting Bank has not taken into consideration the CRM of the eligible credit protection 
that the Reporting Bank bought in assigning the exposure to internal obligor grades as set 
out in paragraph 7.4.124. 
 
7.4.127 
Subject to paragraph 7.4.128, a Reporting Bank using the supervisory slotting 
criteria for IRBA exposures belonging to the SL asset sub-class must risk-weight those 
exposures in accordance with Table 7-24.

to any IRBA exposure belonging to the SL asset sub-class that is categorised as “good”, 
provided such exposures have a remaining maturity of less than 2.5 years.  
 
7.4.129 
Subject to paragraph 7.4.130, a Reporting Bank using the supervisory slotting 
criteria for IRBA exposures belonging to the HVCRE asset sub-class must risk-weight those 
exposures in accordance with Table 7-25.

of 95% to any IRBA exposure belonging to the HVCRE asset sub-class that is categorised 
as “good”, provided such exposures have a remaining maturity of less than 2.5 years. 
 
 
Sub-division 14:  Calculation of EL Amount 
 
7.4.131 
Subject to paragraph 7.4.133, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the EL 
amount for an IRBA exposure belonging to the IRBA wholesale asset class (other than an 
exposure belonging to the SL asset sub-class or HVCRE asset sub-class for which the 
Reporting Bank is using the supervisory slotting criteria) or the IRBA retail asset class that 
is in default in accordance with the definition of default in Annex 7L is equal to the best 
estimate of expected loss by the Reporting Bank.  
 
7.4.132 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the EL amount for an IRBA exposure belonging 
to the IRBA wholesale asset class (other than an exposure belonging to the SL asset sub-
class or HVCRE asset sub-class for which the Reporting Bank is using the supervisory 
slotting criteria) or the IRBA retail asset class that is not in default in accordance with the 
definition of default in Annex 7L using the following formula:  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-114  
 
 EL amount = PD  x  LGD  x  EAD 
 
 where – 
 
 (a) 
PD  =  PD associated with the obligor grade or pool to which the IRBA 
exposure is assigned and estimated in accordance with Annex 7X;  
 
 (b) 
LGD  = LGD associated with the facility grade or pool to which the IRBA 
exposure is assigned and estimated in accordance with Annex 7X; 
and  
 
 (c) 
EAD  =  EAD for the IRBA exposure calculated in accordance with the 
exposure measurement requirements in Division 2 of this Part. 
 
7.4.133 
For a Reporting Bank using the F-IRBA, the Reporting Bank must ensure that 
the EL amount for an IRBA exposure belonging to the IRBA wholesale asset class (other 
than an exposure belonging to the SL asset sub-class or HVCRE asset sub-class for which 
the Reporting Bank is using the supervisory slotting criteria) that is in default in accordance 
with the definition of default in Annex 7L is equal to the supervisory LGD set out in 
paragraph 7.4.73 multiplied by the EAD of the IRBA exposure calculated in accordance 
with the exposure measurement requirements in Division 2 of this Part.   
 
7.4.134 
Subject to paragraph 7.4.135, a Reporting Bank using the supervisory slotting 
criteria for IRBA exposures belonging to the SL asset sub-class or HVCRE asset sub-class 
must calculate the EL amount for an IRBA exposure belonging to either of these sub-
classes using the following formula: 
 
 EL amount = 8%  x  RW  x  EAD 
 
where – 
 
(a) 
RW  =   risk weight determined in accordance with Table 7-26 for an 
exposure belonging to the SL asset sub-class and Table 7-27 for 
an exposure belonging to the HVCRE asset sub-class; and 
 
(b) 
EAD  =  EAD, or where applicable EAD*, for the exposure calculated in 
accordance with Division 2 of this Part.

to any IRBA exposure belonging to the SL asset sub-class that is categorised as “good”, 
provided such exposures have a remaining maturity of less than 2.5 years. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-115  
 
7.4.136 
A Reporting Bank must aggregate the EL amount calculated for IRBA exposures 
pursuant to paragraphs 7.4.131 to 7.4.135 to obtain a total EL amount. To avoid doubt, a 
Reporting Bank must ensure that securitisation exposures do not contribute to the total 
EL amount.

Division 5: Equity Investments in Funds 
 
Sub-division 1: Introduction 
 
7.5.1 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount of 
its equity investments in funds279 using the methods set out in paragraphs 7.5.4 to 7.5.15, 
which vary in their risk sensitivity and conservatism, and in accordance with the following 
hierarchy:  
 
(a)  the look-through approach (“LTA”); 
 
(b) 
the mandate-based approach (“MBA”); or 
 
(c) 
the fall-back approach (“FBA”). 
 
7.5.2 
For the purposes of this Division – 
 
(a)  a Reporting Bank must include its equity investments in all types of funds, 
including an off-balance sheet exposure to a fund280; 
 
(b)  a Reporting Bank must not include any exposure, including any underlying 
exposure held by a fund, that is required to be deducted in the calculation 
of CET1 Capital, AT1 Capital or Tier 2 Capital; 
 
(c)  “funds” includes collective investment schemes and closed-end funds, 
except for real estate investment trusts as defined under section 2 of the 
Securities and Futures Act 2001 and business trusts as defined under the 
Business Trusts Act 2004; and 
 
(d) 
a Reporting Bank must treat its holdings of units in real estate investment 
trusts as defined under section 2 of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 
and business trusts as defined under the Business Trusts Act 2004 as 
holdings in a single equity security for the purposes of risk-weighting. 
 
7.5.3 
Illustrative examples of the requirements set out in this Division are set out in 
Annex 7AB. 
 
 
Sub-division 2: Look-Through Approach (LTA) 
 
 
7.5.4 
A Reporting Bank must use the LTA to calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount of an equity investment in a fund if the following conditions are satisfied: 
  
(a) 
the Reporting Bank is provided sufficient and frequent information 
regarding the underlying exposures of the fund, whereby the frequency of 
financial reporting of the fund is the same as, or more frequent than the 
frequency of financial reporting of the Reporting Bank and the granularity 
 
279  
This refers to equity investments in funds that are held in the banking book, as set out in paragraph 
7.1.1(c).  
280  
An example is an unfunded commitment to subscribe to a fund’s future capital calls. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-117  
of the financial information of the fund is sufficient for the Reporting Bank 
to calculate the corresponding risk weights;  
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank has ensured that such information is verified by an 
independent third party281. 
 
7.5.5 
A Reporting Bank using the LTA must calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount of an equity investment in a fund using the following formula282: 
 
Credit RWELTA = min[Avg RWfund * Lvg, 1250%] * E 
 
where –  
 
(a) 
“Credit RWELTA” refers to the credit risk-weighted exposure amount of an 
equity investment in a fund calculated using the LTA; 
 
(b) 
“Avg RWfund” refers to the average risk weight of the fund, which is 
calculated by the following formula: 
 
Avg RWfund = RWEfund / Total Assetsfund 
 
where –  
 
(i)  
“RWEfund” is the total credit risk-weighted exposure amount of the 
underlying exposures of the fund computed in accordance with 
paragraphs 7.5.7 to 7.5.10; and 
 
(ii) 
“Total Assetsfund” is the total assets of the fund; 
 
(c) 
“Lvg” refers to the leverage of the fund, which is defined as the ratio of 
total assets of the fund to total equity of the fund283; and  
 
(d) 
“E” is the exposure amount calculated in accordance with paragraph 
7.1.12(a).  
 
7.5.6 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.5.4(b), an external audit of the information is 
not required. 
 
7.5.7 
A Reporting Bank using the LTA must calculate RWEfund of a fund by aggregating 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount of each underlying exposure of the fund in 
accordance with Sub-divisions 3, 4, 5 and 7 of Division 1 of this Part, and the CCP RWA of 
each underlying exposure of the fund in accordance with Division 7 of this Part, whichever 
is applicable, as if the exposures were directly held by the Reporting Bank. The Reporting 
Bank must include any underlying exposure arising from the fund’s derivative transactions, 
where the underlying exposure is assigned a risk weight in accordance with Divisions 3, 4 
and 7 of this Part, whichever is applicable, and the associated pre-settlement counterparty 
exposures. The Reporting Bank is not required to calculate the CVA risk capital 
 
281  
For example, the depository or the custodian bank, or where applicable, the management company. 
282  
An example of the calculation of the Credit RWELTA for an equity investment using the LTA is set out in 
Section 1 of Annex 7AB. 
283  
An example of the calculation of the leverage adjustment is set out in Section 3 of Annex 7AB. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

requirements as set out in Division 5 of Part VIII for the fund’s derivative transactions. 
The Reporting Bank must multiply the pre-settlement counterparty exposure amounts 
arising from a fund’s derivative transactions by a factor of 1.5 before applying the risk 
weight assigned to the counterparty in accordance with Divisions 3, 4 and 7 of this Part, 
for derivative transactions within the scope of the CVA risk capital requirements as set out 
in Division 5 of Part VIII.  
 
7.5.8 
Where a Reporting Bank uses the SA(CR) to calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount for the underlying exposures of funds as if the exposures were directly 
held by the Reporting Bank pursuant to Division 3 of this Part, the Reporting Bank using 
the LTA must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount of the underlying 
exposures of a fund using the SA(CR) in accordance with Sub-divisions 3 or 5 of Division 
1 of this Part. To avoid doubt, for underlying exposures of the fund which are equity 
exposures, a Reporting Bank must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount of 
such exposures using the SA(CR) in accordance with Sub-division 3 of Division 1 of this 
Part. 
 
7.5.9  
Where a Reporting Bank uses the IRBA pursuant to Division 4 of this Part to 
calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the underlying exposures of funds 
as if the exposures were directly held by the Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank using 
the LTA must – 
 
(a)  subject to sub-paragraphs (b) and (c), calculate the IRBA parameters 
including PD and, where applicable, LGD and EAD, associated with the 
underlying exposures of the fund, and must calculate the credit risk-
weighted exposure amount of the underlying exposures of the fund using 
the IRBA in accordance with Sub-divisions 4 or 5 of Division 1 of this Part, 
whichever is applicable; 
  
(b) 
where the Reporting Bank is unable to calculate the IRBA parameters 
including PD and, where applicable, LGD and EAD, associated with the 
underlying exposures of the fund284 – 
 
(i)  
for underlying securitisation exposures of the fund, calculate the 
credit risk-weighted exposure amount for such exposures using the 
SEC-ERBA or SEC-SA in accordance with Sub-division 7 of Division 1 
of this Part, according to the hierarchy of approaches determined by 
paragraphs 7.6.16 to 7.6.18. The Reporting Bank must apply a risk 
weight of 1250% to underlying securitisation exposures of the fund 
to which the SEC-ERBA and SEC-SA cannot be applied; and 
 
(ii)  for all other underlying exposures of the fund, calculate the credit 
risk-weighted exposure amount of such underlying exposures using 
the SA(CR) in accordance with Sub-divisions 3 or 5 of Division 1 of 
this Part; and 
 
(c) 
where the Reporting Bank has the approval of the Authority to use the 
SA(CR), to calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amounts for certain 
exposures in accordance with paragraph 7.4.24.  
 
284  
For example, where the Reporting Bank is unable to assign the necessary IRBA parameters to the 
underlying exposures in a manner consistent with its own underwriting standards. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-119  
 
7.5.10 
A Reporting Bank may rely on third party calculations for determining the risk 
weights to be applied to the underlying exposures of a fund, if it does not have adequate 
data or information to perform its own calculations, subject to the following conditions: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the third party applies the risk 
weights under the SA(CR) in accordance with Division 3 of this Part to the 
underlying exposures of the fund, except for underlying securitisation 
exposures; 
 
(b) 
for underlying securitisation exposures of the fund, the Reporting Bank 
must ensure that the third party applies the risk weights under the 
SEC-ERBA or SEC-SA in accordance with Division 6 of this Part to the 
underlying securitisation exposures of the fund, according to the hierarchy 
of approaches determined by paragraphs 7.6.16 to 7.6.18. The Reporting 
Bank must apply a risk weight of 1250% to underlying securitisation 
exposures of the fund to which the SEC-ERBA and SEC-SA cannot be 
applied;  
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that, in all cases, the applicable risk 
weights are 1.2 times higher than the risk weights that would have been 
applicable as if the underlying exposures of the fund were held directly by 
the Reporting Bank.285  
 
 
Sub-division 3: Mandate-Based Approach (MBA) 
 
7.5.11 
Where a Reporting Bank does not satisfy the conditions under paragraph 7.5.4  
for the use of the LTA, the Reporting Bank may use the MBA to calculate the credit risk-
weighted exposure amount of an equity investment in a fund if it is able to determine the 
credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the equity investments in the fund in the manner 
set out in paragraphs 7.5.12 to 7.5.14.  
 
7.5.12 
Under the MBA, the Reporting Bank must determine the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount for an equity investment in a fund by using the information contained in 
the fund’s mandate, in the national regulations governing such investment funds or in 
other disclosures of the fund. For the purposes of this Sub-division, “national regulations” 
refers to laws, regulations, rulings and treaties of a country or jurisdiction. 
 
7.5.13 
A Reporting Bank using the MBA must calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount of an equity investment in a fund using the following formula286: 
 
Credit RWEMBA = min[Avg RWfund * Lvg, 1250%] * E 
 
where –  
 
 
285  
For instance, where the LTA is performed by a third party, the Reporting Bank must apply a risk weight of 
24% (i.e. 1.2*20%) to an exposure that is subject to a 20% risk weight under the SA(CR) as if the 
exposures were held directly by the Reporting Bank. 
286  
An example of the calculation of the Credit RWEMBA for an equity investment in a fund using the MBA is set 
out in Section 2 of Annex 7AB.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-120  
(a) 
“Credit RWEMBA” refers to the credit risk-weighted exposure amount of an 
equity investment in a fund calculated using the MBA; 
 
(b) 
“Avg RWfund” refers to the average risk weight of the fund, which is 
calculated by the following formula: 
 
Avg RWfund = RWEfund / Total Assetsfund 
 
where – 
 
(i) 
“RWEfund” is the total credit risk-weighted exposure amount of the 
underlying exposures of the fund computed in accordance with 
paragraph 7.5.14; and 
 
(ii) 
“Total Assetsfund” is the total assets of the fund; 
 
(c) 
“Lvg” refers to the leverage of the fund, which is defined as the maximum 
financial leverage permitted in the fund’s mandate or in the national 
regulation governing the fund287; and 
 
(d) 
“E” is the exposure amount calculated in accordance with paragraph 
7.1.12(a).  
 
7.5.14 
A Reporting Bank using the MBA288 must calculate RWEfund of a fund as the sum 
of –  
 
(a)  for the balance sheet exposures of the fund, the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amounts using the SA(CR), SEC-ERBA or SEC-SA in accordance 
with Sub-divisions 3 and 7 of Division 1 of this Part, and CCP RWA in 
accordance with Division 7 of this Part, whichever is applicable, as follows:  
 
(i)  
the Reporting Bank must assume that the fund first invests, to the 
maximum extent allowed under the fund’s mandate, in the asset 
class attracting the highest capital requirement, and then continues 
making investments in descending order until the maximum total 
investment level is reached; 
 
(ii)  if more than one risk weight can be applied to a given exposure, the 
Reporting Bank must apply the maximum risk weight289; 
 
(iii)  for underlying securitisation exposures of the fund, the Reporting 
Bank must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for 
such exposures using the SEC-ERBA or SEC-SA in accordance with 
Sub-division 7 of Division 1 of this Part, according to the hierarchy 
of approaches determined by paragraphs 7.6.16 to 7.6.18. The 
 
287  
An example of the calculation of the leverage adjustment is set out in Section 3 of Annex 7AB. 
288  
This requirement ensures that all underlying risks, including counterparty credit risk, are taken into account, 
and that the credit risk-weighted exposure amount calculated for the Reporting Bank’s equity investments 
in funds held in the banking book using the MBA is not less than the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
calculated using the LTA.  
289  
For instance, a Reporting Bank must apply a risk weight of 150% for underlying exposures of funds in 
corporate bonds, in the case where there are no rating restrictions in the fund’s mandate. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-121  
Reporting Bank must apply a risk weight of 1250% to underlying 
securitisation exposures of the fund to which the SEC-ERBA and 
SEC-SA cannot be applied; 
 
(b)  the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the underlying exposures 
arising from the fund’s derivative transactions or off-balance sheet 
exposures of the fund, calculated by applying the risk weights associated 
with the underlying of the fund’s derivative transaction positions or the 
off-balance sheet exposures to their notional amounts, where the 
underlying risk of the fund’s derivative transaction or off-balance sheet 
item receives a risk-weighting treatment in accordance with Divisions 3, 6 
and 7 of this Part, whichever is applicable. The Reporting Bank must use 
the full notional amount of the derivative position if the underlying is 
unknown. The Reporting Bank must use the maximum notional amount of 
derivatives allowed under the mandate if the notional amount of the 
derivative position is unknown; and 
 
(c) 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the pre-settlement 
counterparty exposures associated with the fund’s derivative transactions 
calculated in accordance with the SA-CCR set out in Annex 7D and by 
applying the risk weights assigned for the counterparty under the SA(CR) 
in accordance with Division 3 of this Part or for CCPs in accordance with 
Division 7 of this Part, whichever is applicable, as follows:  
 
(i) 
where the replacement cost is unknown, the Reporting Bank must 
calculate the pre-settlement counterparty exposure amount in a 
conservative manner by using the sum of the notional amounts of 
the derivative transactions in the netting set as a proxy for the 
replacement cost and by using a multiplier set to one in the 
calculation of the amount for potential future exposure;  
 
(ii) 
where the amount for potential future exposure is unknown, the 
Reporting Bank must calculate the amount for potential future 
exposure as 15% of the sum of the notional amounts of the 
derivative transactions in the netting set;  
 
(iii) where both the replacement cost and add-on components are 
unknown, the Reporting Bank must calculate the pre-settlement 
counterparty exposure amount associated with the fund’s derivative 
transactions as 1.4 * (sum of notional amounts of the derivative 
transactions in the netting set + 0.15 * sum of notional amounts of 
the derivative transactions in the netting set); 
 
(iv) the Reporting Bank is not required to calculate the CVA risk capital 
requirements as set out in Division 5 of Part VIII for the fund’s 
derivative transactions. The Reporting Bank must multiply the pre-
settlement counterparty exposure amounts arising from a fund’s 
derivative transactions calculated under sub-paragraphs (c)(i) to 
(c)(iii) by a factor of 1.5 for derivative transactions within the scope 
of the CVA risk capital requirements as set out in Division 5 of Part 
VIII; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-122  
(v) 
the Reporting Bank must apply the risk weight assigned for the 
counterparty under the SA(CR) in accordance with Division 3 of this 
Part or for CCPs in accordance with Division 7 of this Part, whichever 
is applicable, to the sum of the replacement cost and the amount for 
potential future exposure calculated under sub-paragraphs (c)(i) to 
(c)(iv).  
 
 
Sub-division 4: Fall-Back Approach (FBA) 
 
 
7.5.15 
Where a Reporting Bank does not satisfy the conditions under paragraph 7.5.4 
for the use of the LTA and is unable to use the MBA, the Reporting Bank must use the FBA. 
A Reporting Bank using the FBA must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
of an equity investment in a fund by applying a 1250% risk weight to the exposure amount 
calculated in accordance with paragraph 7.1.12(a).   
 
 
Sub-division 5: Treatment of Funds that Invest in Other Funds 
 
7.5.16 
Where a Reporting Bank has an equity investment in a fund (for example, Fund 
A), which it has identified using either the LTA or MBA, and that fund (that is, Fund A) 
itself has an investment in another fund (for example, Fund B), the Reporting Bank may 
apply the LTA, MBA or FBA to determine the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the 
investment of the first fund in the other fund (that is, Fund A’s investment in Fund B). For 
all subsequent layers (for example, Fund B’s investments in Fund C and so forth), the 
Reporting Bank may use the LTA to determine the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
for the investment in the other funds (for example, Fund C), subject to the condition that 
the Reporting Bank also used the LTA to determine the credit risk-weighted exposure 
amount for its equity investment in the fund at the previous layer (for example, Fund B). 
In all other cases, the Reporting Bank must use the FBA. 
 
 
Sub-division 6: Partial Use of an Approach 
 
7.5.17 
A Reporting Bank may use any combination of the 3 methods i.e. LTA, MBA or 
FBA, for determining the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for an equity investment 
in an individual fund, provided that the conditions set out in paragraphs 7.5.1 to 7.5.16 
are satisfied. 
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-123  
Division 6: Securitisation 
 
Sub-division 1:  Introduction 
 
7.6.1 
A Reporting Bank must apply the provisions of Sub-division 7 of Division 1 of 
this Part, and of this Division for determining regulatory capital requirements on exposures 
arising from traditional and synthetic securitisation or similar structures that contain 
features common to both. As securitisations may be structured in many different ways, 
the Reporting Bank must determine the capital treatment of a securitisation on the basis 
of its economic substance rather than its legal form. 
 
7.6.2  
A Reporting Bank must consult the Authority if it is uncertain whether a given 
transaction should be considered a securitisation, and whether a given exposure should 
be considered a securitisation exposure or a resecuritisation exposure. 
 
 
Sub-division 2:  Requirements for the Recognition of Risk Transference 
 
7.6.3 
This Sub-division is applicable only to securitised exposures held in the banking 
book. 
 
 
Requirements for Traditional Securitisation 
 
7.6.4 
A Reporting Bank which is an ABCP programme sponsor or originator of a 
traditional securitisation may exclude securitised exposures from the calculation of credit 
RWA only if all of the requirements in Section 1 of Annex 7AC have been complied with. A 
Reporting Bank meeting these requirements must still hold regulatory capital against any 
securitisation exposures it retains.  
 
 
 
Requirements for Synthetic Securitisation 
 
7.6.5 
Subject to paragraphs 7.6.106 and 7.6.107, a Reporting Bank which is an ABCP 
programme sponsor or originator of a synthetic securitisation may recognise the effects of 
CRM of the synthetic securitisation in its calculation of credit RWA only if –  
 
(a) 
 all of the requirements in Section 2 of Annex 7AC have been complied 
with; and 
 
(b)    the effects of CRM are obtained through eligible credit protection or eligible 
financial collateral, or both, in accordance with Annex 7H. A Reporting 
Bank may recognise the effects of CRM of eligible financial collateral 
pledged by any SPE, but it must not recognise the effect of CRM of any 
eligible credit protection issued by any SPE.  
 
7.6.6 
A Reporting Bank meeting the conditions in paragraph 7.6.5 must still hold 
regulatory capital against any securitisation exposures it retains.  
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-124  
Sub-division 3:  Treatment of Securitisation Exposures 
 
7.6.7 
A Reporting Bank must include in its calculation of credit RWA all of its 
securitisation exposures held in the banking book. 
 
7.6.8 
For a Reporting Bank to apply the SEC-IRBA, SEC-ERBA, SEC-IAA or SEC-SA to 
its securitisation exposures held in the banking book, the Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
have, on an on-going basis, a comprehensive understanding of the risk 
characteristics of its individual securitisation exposures, whether on- or 
off-balance sheet, as well as the risk characteristics of the pools underlying 
its securitisation exposures;  
 
(b) 
be able to access performance information290 on the pools underlying its 
securitisation exposures on an on-going basis and in a timely manner. For 
resecuritisations, the Reporting Bank must have information on the 
underlying securitisation tranches including the issuers’ names and credit 
quality, and the characteristics and performance of the pools underlying 
the securitisation tranches; and 
 
(c) 
have a thorough understanding of all structural features of a securitisation 
transaction that would materially impact the performance of the Reporting 
Bank’s exposures to the transaction, including the contractual waterfall 
and 
waterfall-related 
triggers, 
credit enhancements, 
liquidity 
enhancements, market value triggers, and deal-specific definitions of 
default. 
 
  
7.6.9 
A Reporting Bank which is an originator of a securitisation may offset a 
securitisation exposure to the securitisation that is risk-weighted at 1250% by reducing 
the securitisation exposure amount by the amount of specific allowances on underlying 
assets of that transaction and non-refundable purchase price discounts on such underlying 
assets.  
 
 
Treatment of Overlapping Exposures 
 
7.6.10 
Despite paragraph 7.6.7, where a Reporting Bank is able to verify that it can 
preclude any loss for a securitisation exposure (exposure B) under all circumstances by 
fulfilling its obligations with respect to another securitisation exposure (exposure A), i.e. 
exposure A overlaps exposure B in all circumstances291, the Reporting Bank may exclude 
exposure B from the calculation of credit RWA. 
 
 
290  
Such information may include exposure type, percentage of loans 30, 60 and 90 days past due, default 
rates, prepayment rates, loans in foreclosure, property type, occupancy, average credit score or other 
measures of creditworthiness, average loan-to-value ratio, and industry and geographic diversification. 
291  
For example, where a Reporting Bank provides full credit support to some notes and holds a portion of 
these notes, its full credit support obligation precludes any loss from its exposure to the notes. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-125  
7.6.11 
A Reporting Bank may split or expand its exposures292 to arrive at an overlap 
for the purposes of calculation of credit RWA.  
 
7.6.12 
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.6.10 and 7.6.11, a Reporting Bank may also 
recognise overlap between relevant capital charges for exposures in the trading book and 
capital charges for exposures in the banking book, provided that the Reporting Bank is 
able to calculate and compare the capital charges for the relevant exposures. 
  
 
 
  
Hierarchy of Approaches 
 
7.6.13 
Subject to Sub-division 7 of this Division and paragraphs 7.6.14, 7.6.15, 7.6.86 
and 7.6.87, a Reporting Bank must use the SEC-IRBA to calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount for a securitisation exposure of an IRB pool.  
 
7.6.14 
Where a Reporting Bank is unable to use the SEC-IRBA to calculate the credit 
risk-weighted exposure amount for a securitisation exposure for which the Reporting Bank 
has approval from the Authority under Sub-division 3 of Division 4 of this Part to calculate 
capital requirements using the IRBA for the entire pool of underlying exposures to the 
securitisation293, the Reporting Bank need not comply with paragraph 7.6.13 but the 
Reporting Bank must demonstrate to the Authority why it is unable to do so if requested 
by the Authority.  
 
7.6.15 
Where the Authority prohibits a Reporting Bank from using the SEC-IRBA for a 
particular IRB pool in the case of particular structures and transactions, including  
transactions with highly complex loss allocations, tranches whose credit enhancement 
could be eroded for reasons other than portfolio losses, and tranches of portfolios with 
high internal correlations294, the Reporting Bank must not use the SEC-IRBA to calculate 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for a securitisation exposure of that IRB pool.  
 
7.6.16 
A Reporting Bank must use the SEC-ERBA to calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount for a securitisation exposure of an SA pool if – 
 
(a)  the exposure has an external credit assessment that meets the operational 
requirements for the use of external credit assessments in Section 1 of 
Annex 7AD; or 
 
(b)  the exposure has an inferred credit assessment that meets the operational 
requirements for the use of inferred credit assessments in Section 2 of 
Annex 7AD. 
 
7.6.17 
Subject to the approval of the Authority, a Reporting Bank may use the SEC-IAA  
to calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for an unrated securitisation 
exposure of an SA pool within an ABCP programme. 
 
 
292  
That is, splitting exposures into portions that overlap with another exposure held by the Reporting Bank 
and other portions that do not overlap; and expanding exposures by assuming for capital purposes, that 
obligations with respect to one of the overlapping exposures are larger than those established contractually, 
for instance, by expanding the trigger events to exercise the facility, expanding the extent of the obligation, 
or both. 
293  
For example, due to a lack of sufficient information. 
294  
For example, portfolios with high exposure to single sectors or with high geographical concentration. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-126  
7.6.18 
Subject to paragraph 7.6.19, a Reporting Bank which is not able to or not 
permitted to use the SEC-ERBA or the SEC-IAA to calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount for a securitisation exposure of an SA pool, must use the SEC-SA to do 
so. 
 
7.6.19 
A Reporting Bank must apply a risk weight of 1250% to a securitisation 
exposure to which the SEC-IRBA, SEC-ERBA, SEC-IAA and SEC-SA cannot be applied. 
 
 
Sub-division 4:  Internal Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA) 
7.6.20 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-IRBA to calculate capital requirements for a 
securitisation exposure to an IRB pool must calculate the following inputs: KIRB, the tranche 
attachment point and detachment point, the effective number of exposures and the LGD 
of the pool, in accordance with paragraphs 7.6.21 to 7.6.41. 
 
 
KIRB 
 
7.6.21 
A Reporting Bank must calculate KIRB as the ratio of (a) the IRBA capital 
requirement for the underlying exposures in the pool as if the exposures were held directly 
by the Reporting Bank, to (b) the exposure amount of the underlying pool, expressed as 
a decimal between zero and one. The Reporting Bank must calculate the IRBA capital 
requirement by including the unexpected loss and expected loss of underlying exposures, 
including defaulted exposures, and where applicable, dilution risk in accordance with 
paragraph 7.6.31. In cases where only the drawn balances of revolving loans have been 
securitised, the Reporting Bank must not include the undrawn balances of such loans in 
the calculation of KIRB.  
 
7.6.22 
A Reporting Bank must reflect the effects of CRM that is applied to the 
underlying exposures (either individually or to the entire pool), and hence benefits all of 
the securitisation exposures, in its calculation of KIRB in paragraph 7.6.21. 
 
7.6.23 
For structures involving an SPE, a Reporting Bank must treat all of the SPE’s 
exposures related to the securitisation as exposures in the pool295.   
 
7.6.24 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.6.23, in the case of swaps other than credit 
derivatives, a Reporting Bank must include, in the computation of the IRBA capital 
requirement of the underlying pool used in calculating KIRB, the positive current market 
value of such swaps multiplied by the risk weight of the swap provider and by 8%. The 
Reporting Bank must not include such swaps in the computation of the exposure amount 
of the underlying pool used in calculating KIRB.  
 
7.6.25 
Despite paragraph 7.6.23, a Reporting Bank may exclude the SPE’s exposures 
from the pool for capital calculation purposes if the Reporting Bank can demonstrate to 
 
295  
Such exposures related to the securitisation include reserve accounts, such as cash collateral accounts, and 
claims against counterparties resulting from interest swaps or currency swaps. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-127  
the Authority that the risk associated with the exposures does not affect its particular 
securitisation exposure or that the risk is immaterial296. 
 
7.6.26 
For funded synthetic securitisations, a Reporting Bank must include in the 
calculation of KIRB any proceeds of the issuances of credit-linked notes or any other funded 
obligations of the SPE which serve as collateral for the repayment of the securitisation 
exposure if – 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank cannot demonstrate to the Authority that these are 
immaterial; and  
 
(b) 
the default risk of such collateral is subject to the tranched loss allocation 
in the securitisation transaction. 
 
7.6.27 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.6.26, the Reporting Bank must include, in the 
computation of the IRBA capital requirement of the underlying pool used in calculating 
KIRB, the exposure amount of the collateral multiplied by its risk weight and 8%. The 
Reporting Bank must not include such collateral in the computation of the exposure 
amount of the underlying pool used in calculating KIRB.  
 
7.6.28 
A Reporting Bank must meet all minimum requirements for the use of IRBA to 
calculate KIRB for a securitisation exposure. Notwithstanding, a Reporting Bank may, 
subject to the Authority’s approval, use the top-down approach as set out in Sub-division 
10 of Division 4 of this Part, subject to the modifications set out in paragraph 7.6.29 to 
calculate KIRB for a securitisation exposure if –  
 
(a) 
for non-retail assets, it would be an undue burden on the Reporting Bank 
to assess the default risk of individual obligors; and 
 
(b) 
for retail assets, the Reporting Bank is unable to primarily rely on internal 
data. 
 
7.6.29 
A Reporting Bank when applying the requirements in Sub-division 10 of Division 
4 of this Part and Annex 7T to securitisation exposures using a top-down approach must 
apply the requirements with the following modifications:  
 
(a) 
“eligible purchased receivables”, “purchased receivables”, “purchased 
corporate receivables”, “purchased corporate small business receivables”, 
“purchased retail receivables” and “receivables” in Sub-division 10 of 
Division 4 of this Part and Annex 7T, is read as referring to assets 
underlying a securitisation;  
 
(b) the requirement in paragraph 7.4.98(c) for the Reporting Bank to have a 
claim on all proceeds from the pool of receivables or a pro rata interest in 
the proceeds does not apply. Instead, the Reporting Bank must have a 
 
296  
For example, the Reporting Bank demonstrates that the risk has been mitigated. In the case of swaps, 
certain best market practices can eliminate or at least significantly reduce the potential risk from a default 
of a swap provider. Such features could include cash collateralisation of the market value in combination

claim on all proceeds from the pool of assets underlying a securitisation 
that have been allocated to the Reporting Bank’s exposure to the 
securitisation in accordance with the terms of the related securitisation 
documentation;  
 
(c) 
if the Reporting Bank cannot itself meet the requirements in paragraphs 
2.2 to 2.9 of Annex 7T, it must instead ensure that it meets these 
requirements through a party to the securitisation acting for and in the 
interest of the investors in the securitisation, in accordance with the terms 
of the related securitisation documents. In particular, the Reporting Bank 
must ensure that requirements for effective control and ownership are met 
for all proceeds from the pool of assets underlying the securitisation that 
have been allocated to the Reporting Bank’s exposure to the securitisation. 
The Reporting Bank must ensure the securitisation itself (rather than the 
Reporting Bank) has the relevant policies, procedures, and where 
applicable, information systems referred to in paragraph 2.7(a) of Annex 
7T. 
 
7.6.30 
Where a Reporting Bank has set aside a specific allowance or has a non-
refundable purchase price discount on an exposure in the underlying pool, the Reporting 
Bank must calculate KIRB using the gross amount of the exposure without taking into 
account the specific allowance or the non-refundable purchase price discount. 
 
7.6.31 
A Reporting Bank must recognise dilution risk in a securitisation in the 
calculation of KIRB if the Reporting Bank is unable to demonstrate to the Authority that 
such dilution risk is immaterial. 
 
7.6.32 
Where default risk and dilution risk are treated in an aggregate manner297, the 
Reporting Bank must determine KIRB for dilution risk and default risk respectively, and 
combine them into a single KIRB prior to applying the SEC-IRBA. Where default risk and 
dilution risk are subject to separate waterfalls, the Reporting Bank must consult the 
Authority as to how KIRB must be calculated298. 
 
 
Tranche Attachment Point and Detachment Point 
 
7.6.33 
The tranche attachment point, A, represents the threshold at which losses 
within the underlying pool are first allocated to securitisation exposures in that tranche, 
and is a decimal value between zero and one. A Reporting Bank must calculate A as the 
greater of – 
 
(a) zero; and 
 
(b) the ratio of – 
 
(i) 
the outstanding balance of all underlying assets in the securitisation 
minus the outstanding balance of all tranches in the securitisation 
that rank senior or pari passu to the tranche that contains the 
 
297  
For example, where an identical reserve or overcollateralisation is available to cover losses for both risks.

Annex 7AG provides illustrative examples of how the requirements set out in paragraphs 7.6.31 and 7.6.32 
are to be met. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-129  
securitisation exposure of the Reporting Bank (including the exposure 
itself); to 
 
(ii) 
the outstanding balance of all underlying assets in the securitisation. 
 
7.6.34 
The tranche detachment point, D, represents the threshold at which losses 
within the underlying pool result in a total loss of principal for securitisation exposures in 
that tranche, and is a decimal value between zero and one. A Reporting Bank must 
calculate D as the greater of – 
 
(a) 
zero; and 
 
(b) 
the ratio of – 
 
(i) 
the outstanding balance of all underlying assets in the securitisation 
minus the outstanding balance of all tranches in the securitisation 
that rank senior to the tranche that contains the securitisation 
exposure of the Reporting Bank; to 
 
(ii) 
the outstanding balance of all underlying assets in the securitisation. 
 
7.6.35 
In a Reporting Bank’s calculation of A and D, the Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
recognise overcollateralisation and the loss-absorbing part of funded 
reserve accounts that provide credit enhancement as tranches; and 
 
(b) 
recognise the assets forming the loss-absorbing part of such funded 
reserve accounts that provide credit enhancement as underlying assets. 
 
7.6.36 
A Reporting Bank must not include in its calculation of A and D – 
 
(a) 
unfunded reserve accounts299; 
 
(b) 
assets that do not provide credit enhancement300; or 
 
(c) 
cash collateral accounts related to instruments listed in sub-paragraphs 
(a) and (b).  
 
7.6.37 
In applying paragraphs 7.6.35 and 7.6.36, a Reporting Bank must consider the 
economic substance of the credit enhancement provided by an asset or reserve account 
within the securitisation transaction to a tranche conservatively, for the purposes of 
determining whether the asset or reserve account should be included in the calculation of 
A and D for that tranche. Where the credit enhancement provided by an asset or reserve 
account referred to in paragraphs 7.6.35 and 7.6.36 to a tranche is uncertain, the 
Reporting Bank must exclude the asset or reserve account in the calculation of A and D 
for that tranche.  
 
 
 
299  
For example, reserve accounts that are to be funded from future receipts from the underlying exposures.

For example, pure liquidity support, or currency or interest rate swaps. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

N and LGD 
 
7.6.38 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the effective number of exposures in the 
underlying pool, N, as –  
𝑁=
(∑𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑖
𝑖
)2
∑𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑖
2
𝑖
 
 
where EADi represents the exposure-at-default associated with the ith instrument in the 
pool. The Reporting Bank must consolidate and treat multiple exposures to the same 
obligor as a single instrument. 
 
7.6.39 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the exposure-weighted average LGD of the 
underlying pool as – 
𝐿𝐺𝐷𝑎𝑣𝑔=
∑(𝐿𝐺𝐷𝑖∙𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑖)
𝑖
∑𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑖
𝑖
 
 
where LGDi represents the average LGD associated with all exposures to the ith obligor 
represented in the underlying pool. Where default risk and dilution risk are treated in an 
aggregate manner301 within a securitisation transaction, the Reporting Bank must calculate 
the LGDavg input as a weighted average of the LGD for default risk and the 100% LGD for 
dilution risk. The weights to be applied are the stand-alone IRBA capital requirements for 
default risk and dilution risk respectively. 
 
7.6.40 
If the largest exposure in the underlying pool constitutes not more than 3% of 
the underlying exposures, a Reporting Bank may, for the purposes of the SEC-IRBA, apply 
a simplified method for computing N and LGD as follows – 
𝑁= (𝐶1 ∙𝐶𝑚+ (𝐶𝑚−𝐶1
𝑚−1 ) × max {1 −𝑚× 𝐶1, 0})
−1
 
 
𝐿𝐺𝐷𝑎𝑣𝑔= 0.5 
 
where Cm is the proportion of the underlying exposures constituted by the sum of the 
largest m exposures in the underlying pool, with the value of m determined by the 
Reporting Bank, and C1 is the proportion of the underlying exposures constituted by the 
largest exposure in the underlying pool. 
 
7.6.41 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.6.40, if only C1 is available and this amount is 
no more than 0.03, a Reporting Bank may compute N as 1/C1 and LGDavg as 0.5.  
 
 
Supervisory Parameter 
 
7.6.42 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the supervisory parameter p under the 
SEC-IRBA as –  
 
p = max [0.3, (𝐴+ 
𝐵
𝑁+ (𝐶× 𝐾𝐼𝑅𝐵) + (𝐷× 𝐿𝐺𝐷𝑎𝑣𝑔) + (𝐸× 𝑀𝑇))] 
 
where – 
 
 
301  
For example, where an identical reserve or overcollateralisation is available to cover losses for both risks. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-131  
(a) 
0.3 is the floor of the supervisory parameter p; 
 
(b) 
N is the effective number of exposures in the underlying pool calculated 
in accordance with paragraphs 7.6.38, 7.6.40 and 7.6.41; 
 
(c) 
KIRB is the IRBA capital requirement of the entire portfolio of underlying 
exposures per dollar value of exposure calculated in accordance with 
paragraphs 7.6.21 to 7.6.32; 
 
(d) 
LGDavg is the exposure-weighted average LGD of the underlying pool

If the underlying pool consists of both retail and wholesale exposures, a 
Reporting Bank must divide the pool into one retail sub-pool and one wholesale sub-pool, 
and calculate a separate p-parameter for each sub-pool. Subsequently, the Reporting Bank 
must calculate a weighted average p-parameter for the transaction based on the 
p-parameters of each sub-pool and the exposure amount in each sub-pool. 
 
7.6.44 
If a Reporting Bank applies the SEC-IRBA to a mixed pool as described in 
Sub-division 8 of this Division, the Reporting Bank must calculate the p-parameter based 
on the underlying pool used in calculating KIRB only. 
 
 
Capital Requirements and Risk Weights under SEC-IRBA 
 
7.6.45 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-IRBA must calculate the capital requirement 
per dollar value of securitisation exposure using the following formula:  
𝐾𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐴(𝐾𝐼𝑅𝐵) = 𝑒𝑎·𝑢−𝑒𝑎·𝑙
𝑎(𝑢−𝑙)  
 
where e is the base of the natural logarithms (approximately equal to 2.71828) and the 
variables a, u, and l are defined as follows –  
 
(a) 
𝑎= −(
1
𝑝 ×𝐾𝐼𝑅𝐵 ); 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-132  
(b) 
𝑢= 𝐷−𝐾𝐼𝑅𝐵; and  
 
(c) 
𝑙= 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝐴−𝐾𝐼𝑅𝐵, 0) 
 
7.6.46 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-IRBA must calculate the risk weight assigned 
to a securitisation exposure as follows, subject to a floor of 15% for the resultant risk 
weight and paragraph 7.6.47:  
 
(a) 
when the tranche detachment point, D, for a securitisation exposure is 
less than or equal to KIRB, the risk weight is 1250%; 
 
(b) 
when the tranche attachment point, A, for a securitisation exposure is 
greater than or equal to KIRB, the risk weight of the exposure, expressed 
as a percentage, is  𝑲𝑺𝑺𝑭𝑨(𝑲𝑰𝑹𝑩) multiplied by 12.5;  
 
(c) 
when KIRB is more than A but less than D, the risk weight is the weighted 
average of 1250% and 𝑲𝑺𝑺𝑭𝑨(𝑲𝑰𝑹𝑩)  multiplied by 12.5 according to the 
following formula –  
 
𝑅𝑊= [(𝐾𝐼𝑅𝐵−𝐴
𝐷−𝐴) × 12.5] + [(𝐷−𝐾𝐼𝑅𝐵
𝐷−𝐴) × 12.5 × 𝐾𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐴(𝐾𝐼𝑅𝐵) ] 
 
7.6.47 
A Reporting Bank must infer the risk weight for market risk hedges, including 
currency or interest rate swaps, from a securitisation exposure that is pari passu to the 
hedge instrument or, if such an exposure does not exist, from the next subordinated 
tranche. 
 
 
Sub-division 5:  External Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-ERBA) 
 
Short-Term External Credit Assessment 
 
7.6.48 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-ERBA must assign a securitisation exposure for 
which – 
 
(a)  a short-term external credit assessment; or 
  
(b) 
an inferred credit assessment based on a short-term credit assessment, 
 
is available and which meets the operational requirements in Annex 7AD pursuant to 
paragraph 7.6.16, to a credit quality grade in accordance with Table 7M-4. Subject to 
paragraph 7.6.54, the Reporting Bank must risk-weight the securitisation exposure in 
accordance with Table 7-29 and paragraph 7.6.53. The Reporting Bank must subject the 
resulting risk weight to a floor of 15%.

A Reporting Bank using the SEC-ERBA must assign a securitisation exposure for 
which – 
 
(a)  a long-term external credit assessment; or 
  
(b) 
an inferred credit assessment based on a long-term external credit 
assessment,  
 
is available and which meets the operational requirements in Annex 7AD pursuant to 
paragraph 7.6.16, to a credit quality grade in accordance with Table 7M-3. Subject to 
paragraph 7.6.54, the Reporting Bank must risk-weight the securitisation exposure in 
accordance with Table 7-30 and paragraph 7.6.53, with the risk weight adjusted for 
tranche maturity and tranche thickness (for non-senior tranches) in accordance with 
paragraphs 7.6.50 to 7.6.52. The Reporting Bank must subject the resulting risk weight 
to a floor of 15%.

To account for the tranche maturity of a securitisation exposure, a Reporting 
Bank must use linear interpolation between the appropriate risk weights provided in Table 
7-30 for a one-year maturity and a 5-year maturity, as follows – 
 
𝑅𝑊𝑀 𝑎𝑑𝑗. = 𝑅𝑊(𝑀=1) + (𝑅𝑊(𝑀=5) −𝑅𝑊(𝑀=1)) ∙(𝑀𝑇−1
5 −1 ) 
 
where – 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-134  
(a) 
RWM adj. is the risk weight of the securitisation exposure after accounting 
for tranche maturity; 
 
(b)  RW(M=1) is the applicable risk weight for the securitisation exposure, 
assuming it has a tranche maturity of one year; 
 
(c)  RW(M=5) is the applicable risk weight for the securitisation exposure, 
assuming it has a tranche maturity of 5 years; and 
 
(d) 
MT is the tranche maturity of the securitisation exposure calculated in 
accordance with Section 6 of Annex 7V. 
 
7.6.51  
A Reporting Bank must calculate the risk weight of a senior securitisation 
exposure as – 
 
𝑅𝑊= 𝑅𝑊𝑀 𝑎𝑑𝑗. 
 
where – 
 
(a) 
RWM adj. is the risk weight of the securitisation exposure after accounting 
for tranche maturity; and 
 
(b) 
RW is the risk weight of the senior securitisation exposure assigned under 
the SEC-ERBA. 
 
7.6.52 
To account for the tranche thickness of a non-senior securitisation exposure, a 
Reporting Bank must calculate the risk weight of a non-senior tranche as follows – 
 
𝑅𝑊= 𝑅𝑊𝑀 𝑎𝑑𝑗. ∙[1 −min (𝑇, 0.5)] 
 
where – 
 
(a) 
T is the thickness of the tranche where the non-senior securitisation 
exposure resides, and is calculated as (D – A), as D and A are defined in 
paragraphs 7.6.33 to 7.6.37;  
 
(b) 
RWM adj. is the risk weight as determined in accordance with paragraph 
7.6.50; and 
 
(c) 
RW is the risk weight of the non-senior securitisation exposure assigned 
under the SEC-ERBA.   
 
7.6.53 
A Reporting Bank must infer the risk weight for market risk hedges302 from a 
securitisation exposure that is pari passu to the hedge instrument or, if such an exposure 
does not exist, from the next subordinated tranche. 
 
7.6.54 
When a Reporting Bank applies the SEC-ERBA to a non-senior exposure in a 
transaction where the relatively more senior exposures (i.e. securitisation exposures with 
precedence in claims on the cash flows from the underlying exposures) are rated, the 
Reporting Bank must not apply a risk weight under the SEC-ERBA for the non-senior 
 
302  
For example, currency or interest rate swaps.

exposure which is lower than the risk weight for an exposure to the immediately preceding 
more senior exposure of the same securitisation with the same rating and maturity. 
 
 
Sub-division 6:  Internal Assessment Approach (SEC-IAA) 
 
7.6.55 
Subject to the written approval of the Authority, a Reporting Bank may use the 
SEC-IAA to determine its capital requirement for unrated securitisation exposures303 to an 
ABCP programme, provided that – 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank has obtained the Authority’s approval to adopt the 
IRBA for least one asset class; and 
 
(b) 
the internal assessment process of the Reporting Bank meets the 
operational requirements set out in paragraph 7.6.59. 
 
7.6.56  
Despite paragraph 7.6.55, the Authority may require the Reporting Bank to 
apply an approach other than the SEC-IAA to the unrated securitisation exposures that 
the Reporting Bank extends to the ABCP programme, in order to ensure an appropriate 
level of capital requirements. 
 
7.6.57 
The Authority may subsequently withdraw its approval of a Reporting Bank’s 
use of the SEC-IAA to determine its capital requirement for unrated securitisation 
exposures to an ABCP programme, whether such exposures are existing or newly 
originated, if the Authority is not satisfied that the Reporting Bank meets the requirements 
in paragraph 7.6.59, until the Reporting Bank has remedied the deficiencies and met the 
requirements in paragraph 7.6.59.  
 
7.6.58  
If a Reporting Bank does not have the Authority’s approval to apply the SEC-IAA, 
it must use the SEC-SA to determine its capital requirement for unrated securitisation 
exposures to an ABCP programme.  
 
7.6.59 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-IAA to determine its capital requirement for 
unrated securitisation exposures to an ABCP programme must ensure that all of the 
following conditions are met: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the commercial paper issued by the 
ABCP programme is rated by a recognised ECAI, and the Reporting Bank 
must use the SEC-ERBA to risk-weight any exposures it has to the 
commercial paper; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must consider all publicly available assessment 
methodologies of recognised ECAIs for the type of asset purchased by the 
programme in developing its internal assessments. For the purposes of 
this sub-paragraph – 
 
(i) 
subject to sub-paragraph (b)(ii), if all the assessment methodologies 
of recognised ECAIs for an asset are not publicly available, then the 
Reporting Bank must not use the SEC-IAA; 
 
303  
Examples of such exposures are liquidity facilities and credit enhancements that the Reporting Bank 
provides to the ABCP programme. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-136  
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank may discuss a specific transaction304 with the 
Authority to determine whether the SEC-IAA may be applied; and 
 
(iii) the Reporting Bank must not use the assessment methodology of a 
recognised ECAI to derive an internal assessment if this assessment 
methodology is not publicly available305; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must – 
 
(i) 
base the internal assessment of the credit quality of a securitisation 
exposure to the ABCP programme on the assessment criteria of 
recognised ECAIs for the type of asset purchased by the ABCP 
programme and ensure that this internal assessment is the 
equivalent of a credit quality grade of “10” or better in accordance 
with Table 7M-3 when the Reporting Bank initially assigns this 
internal assessment to the securitisation exposure; and 
 
(ii) 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that its internal 
assessments correspond with the relevant standard of the 
recognised ECAI306;  
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank must use the internal assessment of the credit quality 
of a securitisation exposure to the ABCP programme in the internal risk 
management processes of the Reporting Bank, including its management 
information and economic capital systems, and ensure that this internal 
assessment meets all the relevant requirements of the IRBA framework 
set out in Annex 7X;  
 
(e) 
the Reporting Bank must identify gradations of risk in its internal 
assessment process and ensure that the internal ratings based on its 
internal 
assessment 
process 
correspond 
to 
the 
external 
credit 
assessments of recognised ECAIs; 
 
(f) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that its internal assessment process, 
particularly the stress factors for determining credit enhancement 
requirements, is at least as conservative as the publicly available 
assessment criteria of recognised ECAIs that have rated the commercial 
paper issued by the ABCP programme, for the asset type being purchased 
by the ABCP programme, and – 
 
(i) 
in the case where the commercial paper issued by an ABCP 
programme is externally rated by 2 or more recognised ECAIs and 
 
304  
For example, such transactions could be new or uniquely structured transactions which are not currently 
addressed by the credit assessment criteria of a recognised ECAI assessing the ABCP programme.  
305  
However, the Reporting Bank should also consider non-publicly available assessment methodologies of 
recognised ECAIs, to the extent that it has access to such information, in developing its internal 
assessments, particularly if it leads to more conservative credit assessments than the publicly available 
methodologies.  
306  
In the case of the Reporting Bank’s calculation of the credit enhancement level using the SEC-IAA, the 
Authority may disallow, on a full or partial basis, any recourse guarantees provided by the ABCP transaction 
seller or excess spread, or any other first loss credit enhancements that provide limited credit protection 
to the Reporting Bank.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-137  
the benchmark stress factors of the different ECAIs require different 
levels of credit enhancement to achieve the equivalent external 
credit assessment, the Reporting Bank must apply the stress factor 
that requires the most conservative or highest level of credit 
protection307;  
 
(ii) 
when selecting recognised ECAIs to externally rate the commercial 
paper issued by an ABCP programme, the Reporting Bank must not 
choose only those ECAIs that generally have relatively less restrictive 
assessment methodologies; and 
 
(iii)  if there are changes in the assessment methodology of a selected 
ECAI, including the stress factors, that adversely affect the external 
credit assessment of the commercial paper issued by the ABCP 
programme, the Reporting Bank must consider the revised 
assessment methodology in evaluating whether the internal 
assessments assigned to the Reporting Bank’s securitisation 
exposures to the ABCP programme are in need of revision; 
 
(g) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that – 
 
(i) 
IA, external auditors, a recognised ECAI, or the internal credit review 
or risk management function of the Reporting Bank performs reviews 
of the internal assessment process at least annually and assess the 
validity of the internal assessments of the Reporting Bank; and 
 
(ii) 
if the IA, internal credit review function, or risk management function 
of the Reporting Bank performs the reviews of the internal 
assessment process, such a function is independent of the ABCP 
programme business line and the underlying customer relationships; 
 
(h) 
the Reporting Bank must track the performance of its internal assessments 
over time to evaluate the performance of the assigned internal 
assessments and make adjustments to its assessment process when the 
performance of its securitisation exposures to the ABCP programme 
routinely diverges from the assigned internal assessments on those 
exposures; 
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the ABCP programme has credit and 
investment guidelines which cover underwriting standards308; 
 
(j) 
the Reporting Bank must perform a credit analysis of the risk profile of the 
ABCP transaction seller, which includes – 
 
307  
For example, if one ECAI required credit enhancement of 2.5 to 3.5 times historical losses for a type of 
asset and another ECAI required 2 to 3 times historical losses, to assign a single “A” credit assessment, 
the Reporting Bank must use the stress factors utilised by the ECAI that would require the higher range of 
credit enhancements provided by the ABCP transaction seller.

In the consideration of an asset purchase, the ABCP programme administrator should develop an outline 
of the structure of the purchase transaction and consider the following: the type of asset being purchased, 
the type and monetary value of the exposures arising from the provision of liquidity facilities and credit 
enhancements, the loss waterfall, and the legal and economic isolation of the transferred assets from the 
entity selling the assets. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-138  
 
(i) 
consideration of past and expected future financial performance, 
current market position, expected future competitiveness, leverage, 
cash flow and interest coverage and debt rating; and 
 
(ii) 
a review of the ABCP transaction seller’s underwriting standards, 
servicing capabilities, and collection processes; 
 
(k) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the underwriting policy of the ABCP 
programme establishes asset eligibility criteria that includes prohibitions 
on the purchase of assets that are significantly past due or defaulted, 
limits on excess concentration to an individual obligor or a geographic 
region and limits on the tenor of the assets to be purchased; 
 
(l) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the ABCP programme establishes 
collection processes that consider the operational capability and credit 
quality of the servicer, and mitigates seller risk and servicer risk309; 
 
(m) the Reporting Bank, in its aggregate estimate of loss on an asset pool that 
the ABCP programme is considering purchasing, must take into account 
all sources of potential risk, including credit risk and dilution risk310; 
 
(n) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the ABCP programme incorporates  
structural features into the purchase of assets in order to mitigate 
potential credit deterioration of the underlying portfolio311. 
 
7.6.60 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.6.59(d), a Reporting Bank must inform the 
Authority prior to the use of the SEC-IAA, if its internal assessments are unable to meet 
any of the use test requirements set out in paragraph 2.7(a) of Annex 7X, read with the 
following modifications: 
 
(a) 
“IRBA” is read as referring to the SEC-IAA; 
 
(b) 
“internal ratings and estimates of IRBA parameters” is read as referring to 
SEC-IAA internal ratings. 
 
7.6.61 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-IAA must calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount for an unrated securitisation exposure to an ABCP programme by – 
 
 
309  
This can be achieved through various methods, such as setting triggers based on the credit quality of the 
seller or the servicer, prohibiting the commingling of funds or imposing lockbox arrangements, so as to 
help ensure the continuity of payments from the underlying pool to the ABCP programme. 
310  
For the purposes of this sub-paragraph – 
(a) if the credit enhancement provided by the ABCP transaction seller is sized based on only credit-related 
losses and dilution risk is material for the particular exposure pool, the Reporting Bank should establish 
a separate reserve for dilution risk;  
(b) in sizing the required credit enhancement level, the Reporting Bank should review several years of 
historical information, including losses, delinquencies, dilutions, and the turnover rate of the 
receivables; and  
(c)  the Reporting Bank should evaluate the characteristics of the underlying asset pool, for example, 
weighted average credit score, and the granularity of the asset pool, and identify any concentrations 
to an individual obligor or geographic region. 
311  
Such features may include wind-down triggers specific to a pool of exposures.

(a) 
assigning an internal rating, mapped to an equivalent short-term external 
credit assessment or long-term external credit assessment, to the unrated 
securitisation exposure;  
 
(b) 
allocating the risk weight appropriate to the equivalent short-term 
external credit assessment or long-term external credit assessment 
assigned to that exposure in accordance with Table 7-29 or 7-30 
respectively, except where the equivalent short-term external credit 
assessment does not map to a short-term credit quality grade of “III” or 
better as set out in Table 7M-4, or where the equivalent long-term external 
credit assessment does not map to a credit quality grade of “10” or better 
as set out in Table 7M-3, in which case the Reporting Bank must apply a 
1250% risk weight to the unrated securitisation exposure; and  
 
(c) 
applying the formula in paragraph 7.1.14. 
 
 
Sub-division 7:  Standardised Approach (SEC-SA) 
 
7.6.62 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-SA to calculate capital requirements for a 
securitisation exposure to an SA pool must calculate the following inputs: KSA, ratio of total 
delinquent underlying exposures to total underlying exposures in the pool (W), and tranche 
attachment point (A) and detachment point (D), in accordance with paragraphs 7.6.63 to 
7.6.79. 
 
 
 KSA 
 
7.6.63 
KSA is the weighted-average capital requirement of the entire portfolio of 
underlying exposures per dollar value of exposure, calculated by applying the SA(CR) as 
if the underlying exposures had not been securitised, multiplied by 8%. 
 
7.6.64 
A Reporting Bank must calculate KSA according to the following formula, 
expressed as a decimal between zero and one – 
 
𝐾𝑆𝐴=
𝑆𝐴(𝐶𝑅) 𝑅𝑊𝐴 𝑈𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔+ 𝐶𝐶𝑅−𝑆𝐴 𝑅𝑊𝐴𝑈𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔
𝑆𝐴(𝐶𝑅) 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑈𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔+ 𝐶𝐶𝑅 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑈𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔
∙8% 
 
The Reporting Bank must calculate SA(CR) RWA according to paragraph 7.1.3 and CCR-SA 
RWA according to paragraph 7.1.9.  
 
7.6.65 
A Reporting Bank must reflect the effects of CRM that is applied to the 
underlying exposures (either individually or to the entire pool) in its calculation of KSA. 
 
7.6.66 
For structures involving an SPE, a Reporting Bank must treat all of the SPE’s 
exposures related to the securitisation as exposures in the pool. A Reporting Bank must 
include reserve accounts, cash collateral accounts and claims against counterparties 
resulting from interest rate swaps or currency swaps as exposures related to the 
securitisation. In the case of swaps other than credit derivatives, the Reporting Bank must 
include, in the computation of 𝐶𝐶𝑅−𝑆𝐴 𝑅𝑊𝐴𝑈𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 used in calculating KSA, the positive 
current market value multiplied by the risk weight of the swap provider and by 8%. The 
Reporting Bank must not include such swaps in the computation of 𝐶𝐶𝑅 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑈𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-140  
used in calculating KSA, as such a swap would not provide a credit enhancement to any 
tranche. The Reporting Bank may exclude the SPE’s exposures from the pool for capital 
calculation purposes if the Reporting Bank can demonstrate to the Authority that the risk 
associated with the exposures does not affect its particular securitisation exposure or that 
the risk is not material312. 
 
7.6.67 
For funded synthetic securitisations, a Reporting Bank must include in the 
calculation of KSA any proceeds of the issuances of credit-linked notes or other funded 
obligations of the SPE which serve as collateral for the repayment of the securitisation 
exposure if –  
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank cannot demonstrate to the Authority that these are 
not material; and 
 
(b) 
the default risk of the collateral is subject to the tranched loss allocation 
in the securitisation transaction.  
 
7.6.68 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.6.64, a Reporting Bank must include in the 
computation of 𝑆𝐴(𝐶𝑅) 𝑅𝑊𝐴𝑈𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 and 𝐶𝐶𝑅−𝑆𝐴 𝑅𝑊𝐴𝑈𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 used in calculating KSA the 
exposure amount of the collateral multiplied by its risk weight and by 8%. The Reporting 
Bank must not include such collateral in the computation of 𝑆𝐴(𝐶𝑅) 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑈𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 and 
𝐶𝐶𝑅 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑈𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 used in calculating KSA.  
 
7.6.69 
Where a Reporting Bank has set aside a specific allowance or has a 
non-refundable purchase price discount on an exposure in the underlying pool, the 
Reporting Bank must calculate KSA using the gross amount of the exposure without taking 
into account the specific allowance or the non-refundable purchase price discount. 
 
 
W 
 
7.6.70 
A Reporting Bank must calculate W, the ratio of the sum of the nominal amount 
of delinquent underlying exposures to the total nominal amount of underlying exposures 
in the pool. Delinquent underlying exposures are underlying exposures that are 90 days 
or more past due, subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, in the process of 
foreclosure, held as real estate owned or in default, where default is defined within the 
securitisation deal documents. 
 
 
Tranche Attachment Point and Detachment Point 
 
7.6.71 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the tranche attachment point, A, and the 
tranche attachment point, D, in accordance with paragraphs 7.6.33 to 7.6.37. 
 
7.6.72 
Where the only difference between exposures to a transaction is related to 
maturity, A and D are the same.  
 
 
 
312  
For example, the Reporting Bank demonstrates that the risk has been mitigated. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-141  
Capital Requirements and Risk Weights under SEC-SA 
 
7.6.73 
A Reporting Bank must calculate KA, using the inputs KSA and W, as follows:  
 
𝐾𝐴= (1 −𝑊) × 𝐾𝑆𝐴+ 𝑊× 0.5  
 
7.6.74 
If a Reporting Bank does not know the delinquency status, as defined in 
paragraph 7.6.70, for no more than 5% of underlying exposures in the pool (calculated by 
E, as defined in Division 2 of this Part), the Reporting Bank may use the SEC-SA by 
adjusting its calculation of KA as follows: 
 
𝐾𝐴= (𝐸𝑆𝑢𝑏𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙 1 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑊 𝑖𝑠 𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛
𝐸𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙
× 𝐾𝐴
𝑆𝑢𝑏𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙 1 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑊 𝑖𝑠 𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛) + 𝐸𝑆𝑢𝑏𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙 2 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑊 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛
𝐸𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙
 
 
If the Reporting Bank does not know the delinquency status for more than 5% of 
underlying exposures in the pool (calculated by E, as defined in Division 2 of this Part), 
the Reporting Bank must risk-weight the securitisation exposure at 1250%. 
 
7.6.75 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-SA must calculate the capital requirement per 
dollar value of securitisation exposure using the following formula:  
 
𝐾𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐴(𝐾𝐴) = 𝑒𝑎·𝑢−𝑒𝑎·𝑙
𝑎(𝑢−𝑙)  
 
where e is the base of the natural logarithms (approximately equal to 2.71828) and the 
variables a, u, and l are defined as follows:  
 
(a) 
 𝑎= −(
1
𝑝 ×𝐾𝐴 );  
 
(b) 
 𝑢= 𝐷−𝐾𝐴; and 
 
(c) 
 𝑙= 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝐴−𝐾𝐴, 0). 
 
7.6.76 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.6.75, the supervisory parameter p under the 
SEC-SA is one for a securitisation exposure that is not a resecuritisation exposure. 
 
7.6.77 
Subject to paragraph 7.6.79, a Reporting Bank must risk-weight any 
securitisation exposure for which it is using the SEC-SA in accordance with sub-paragraphs 
(a), (b), and (c), and paragraph 7.6.78. The Reporting Bank must subject the resulting 
risk weight to a floor of 15%. 
 
(a) 
when the tranche detachment point, D for a securitisation exposure is less 
than or equal to KA, the risk weight is 1250%; 
 
(b) 
when the tranche attachment point, A for a securitisation exposure is 
greater than or equal to KA, the risk weight of the exposure, expressed as 
a percentage, is 𝐾𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐴(𝐾𝐴) multiplied by 12.5;  
 
(c) 
when KA is more than A but less than D, the risk weight is the weighted 
average of 1250% and 𝐾𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐴(𝐾𝐴)  multiplied by 12.5 according to the 
following formula: 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-142  
 
𝑅𝑊= [(𝐾𝐴−𝐴
𝐷−𝐴) × 12.5] + [(𝐷−𝐾𝐴
𝐷−𝐴) × 12.5 × 𝐾𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐴(𝐾𝐴) ] 
 
7.6.78 
A Reporting Bank must infer the risk weight for market risk hedges313 from a 
securitisation exposure that is pari passu to the hedge instrument or, if such an exposure 
does not exist, from the next subordinated tranche. 
 
7.6.79 
When a Reporting Bank applies the SEC-SA to an unrated non-senior exposure 
in a transaction where the relatively more senior exposures (i.e. securitisation exposures 
with precedence in claims on the cash flows from the underlying exposures) are rated, the 
Reporting Bank must not apply a risk weight under SEC-SA for the unrated non-senior 
exposure which is lower than the risk weight for the immediately preceding more senior 
rated exposure.  
 
 
Sub-division 8: Treatment of Mixed Pools 
 
7.6.80 
Where a Reporting Bank is able to calculate KIRB on at least 95% of the 
underlying exposure amounts of a securitisation, the Reporting Bank must apply the 
SEC-IRBA calculating the capital requirement for the underlying pool as – 
 
 𝑑× 𝐾𝐼𝑅𝐵+ (1 −𝑑) × 𝐾𝑆𝐴 
 
where d is the percentage of the exposure amount of underlying exposures for which the 
Reporting Bank is able to calculate KIRB over the exposure amount of all underlying 
exposures, KIRB is defined in paragraphs 7.6.21 to 7.6.32, and KSA is defined in paragraphs 
7.6.63 to 7.6.69.   
 
7.6.81 
Where a Reporting Bank is not able to calculate KIRB on at least 95% of the 
underlying amounts of a securitisation, the Reporting Bank must use the hierarchy for 
securitisation exposures of SA pools as set out in paragraphs 7.6.16 to 7.6.19. 
 
 
Sub-division 9: Treatment of Resecuritisation Exposures 
 
7.6.82 
A Reporting Bank must risk-weight any resecuritisation exposure by applying 
the SEC-SA, with the following adjustments and subject the resulting risk weight to a floor 
of 100%:  
 
(a) 
the capital requirement of the resecuritisation’s underlying securitisation 
exposures (KSA) is calculated using the securitisation framework in this 
Division instead of the SA(CR) and CCR-SA; 
 
(b) 
delinquencies (W) are set to zero for any exposure to a securitisation 
tranche in the underlying pool;  
 
(c) 
the supervisory parameter p is set equal to 1.5, rather than 1. 
 
 
313  
For example, currency or interest rate swaps. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-143  
7.6.83 
If the underlying portfolio of a resecuritisation consists of a pool with exposures 
to securitisation tranches and exposures to other non-securitised assets, a Reporting Bank 
must separate the portfolio into 2 subsets, one consisting of securitisation tranches, and 
one consisting of exposures to other non-securitised assets. The Reporting Bank must 
calculate KA separately for each subset, with separate KSA and W parameters. The 
Reporting Bank must calculate W in accordance with paragraph 7.6.70 in the subset where 
the exposures are to non-securitised assets, and set W to zero where the exposures are 
to securitisation tranches. The Reporting Bank must then calculate KA for the 
resecuritisation exposure as the nominal exposure weighted-average of the KA for each 
subset.  
 
 
Sub-division 10: Treatment of Securitisations of NPL Securitisations 
 
7.6.84 
A Reporting Bank must risk-weight any securitisation exposure to an NPL 
securitisation in accordance with this Sub-division.  
 
7.6.85 
An NPL securitisation is a securitisation that meets all of the following criteria: 
 
(a) 
at the origination date, and at any subsequent date on which exposures 
are added to or removed from the underlying pool due to replenishment, 
restructuring, or any other reason that the Authority may specify, the 
value of W calculated in accordance with paragraph 7.6.70 is equal to or 
higher than 90%; 
 
(b) 
the underlying pool of the securitisation only comprises loans, loan-
equivalent financial instruments, or tradable instruments used for the sole 
purposes of loan sub-participation as referred to in paragraph 1.1(i) of 
Annex 7AC. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph, “loan-equivalent 
financial instruments” include bonds not listed on any trading venue; 
 
(c) 
the underlying pool of the securitisation does not include any securitisation 
exposures.  
 
7.6.86 
Subject to paragraph 7.6.87, a Reporting Bank must calculate the credit 
risk-weighted exposure amount for an exposure to an NPL securitisation, according to the 
hierarchy of approaches determined by paragraphs 7.6.13 to 7.6.19 and 7.1.15. 
 
7.6.87 
A Reporting Bank using the F-IRBA to calculate KIRB, as set out in paragraph 
7.6.21, of the underlying pool of an NPL securitisation must not apply the SEC-IRBA to a 
securitisation exposure to an NPL securitisation. 
 
7.6.88 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-IRBA, SEC-SA or the “look-through” approach 
set out in paragraph 7.1.15 must apply a floor of 100% to the risk weight assigned to an 
exposure to an NPL securitisation. 
 
7.6.89 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-IRBA or the SEC-SA may assign a risk weight 
of 100% to a senior securitisation exposure to an NPL securitisation where – 
 
(a) 
the NPL securitisation is a traditional securitisation; and 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-144  
(b) 
the sum of the non-refundable purchase price discounts is equal to or 
higher than 50% of the outstanding amount of the pool of exposures. 
 
7.6.90 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.6.89(b), “non-refundable purchase price 
discounts” refer to the difference between the outstanding balance of the exposures in the 
underlying pool and the price at which such exposures are sold by the originator to the 
securitisation entity, where neither the originator nor the original lender are reimbursed 
for this difference. In cases where the originator underwrites tranches of the NPL 
securitisation for subsequent sale, “non-refundable purchase price discounts” may also 
include the differences between the nominal amount of the tranches and the price at which 
these tranches are first sold to unrelated third parties. To avoid doubt, in determining non-
refundable purchase price discounts, a Reporting Bank must only consider the initial sale 
of any given piece of a securitisation tranche and must not consider the purchase prices 
of subsequent re-sales of such exposures. 
 
7.6.91 
A Reporting Bank may cap the risk-weighted exposure amount for the 
securitisation exposures it holds in the same NPL securitisation in accordance with 
paragraphs 7.1.18 to 7.1.20, where the Reporting Bank is acting as – 
 
(a)  an originator; or 
 
(b)  an investor, provided that the Reporting Bank is using the SEC-IRBA for 
an exposure to the NPL securitisation. 
 
7.6.92 
A Reporting Bank must not execute an NPL securitisation transaction for the 
purposes of reducing capital requirements on non-delinquent exposures in the underlying 
pool. 
 
 
Sub-division 11: Treatment of Simple, Transparent and Comparable (“STC”) 
Securitisations 
 
Scope and Identification of STC Securitisations 
 
7.6.93 
A Reporting Bank may apply the provisions in paragraphs 7.6.97 and 7.6.98 for 
a securitisation exposure only if –  
 
(a) the securitisation exposure arises from a traditional securitisation; and 
 
(b) the Reporting Bank has assessed that – 
 
(i) 
in the case of a securitisation exposure arising from a securitisation 
which is not an ABCP programme, the securitisation meets all the 
criteria in Annex 7AE (“STC Criteria”) on an ongoing basis;  
 
(ii) 
in the case of a securitisation exposure to an ABCP conduit of an 
ABCP programme314, the securitisation meets all the conduit level 
and transaction level criteria under the Short-Term STC Criteria in 
Annex 7AF on an ongoing basis; and 
 
314  
For example, exposure arising from investing in commercial papers issued under an ABCP programme or 
sponsoring arrangements at the ABCP programme level. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-145  
 
(iii) in the case of a securitisation exposure to an ABCP transaction of an 
ABCP programme, the securitisation meets all the transaction level 
criteria under the Short-Term STC Criteria in Annex 7AF on an 
ongoing basis. 
 
7.6.94 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.6.93(b), in assessing that a securitisation 
meets all the STC Criteria or relevant Short-term STC Criteria, as the case may be, a 
Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
if it is an investor in the securitisation, make its own assessment based on 
the information provided by the originator of the securitisation; and 
 
(b) 
if it is an originator of the securitisation, make its own assessment for the 
purposes of calculating regulatory capital for securitisation exposures it 
retains in the securitisation, where such retained positions meet the 
requirements in paragraph 1.1(a) of Annex 7AC. 
 
7.6.95 
A Reporting Bank that is an originator of a securitisation must disclose to 
investors all necessary information at the transaction level to allow investors to determine 
whether the securitisation meets all the STC Criteria or relevant Short-term STC Criteria, 
as the case may be.  
 
7.6.96 
A Reporting Bank must assess that the securitisation meets the STC Criteria or 
relevant Short-term STC Criteria, as the case may be, on an ongoing basis and take into 
account developments that may invalidate its previous assessment315 which are relevant 
to the STC Criteria or relevant Short-term STC Criteria, as the case may be. In cases 
where the STC Criteria or relevant Short-term STC Criteria, as the case may be, refer to 
the underlying assets of the securitisation, including but not limited to paragraphs 4.1 and 
4.2 of Annex 7AE, and the pool is dynamic, the Reporting Bank must conduct checks every 
time that assets are added to such pool to assess compliance with the STC Criteria or 
relevant Short-term STC Criteria, as the case may be. 
 
 
Overview of Alternative Capital Treatment for STC Securitisations 
 
7.6.97 
A Reporting Bank, in respect of a securitisation exposure which meets the 
requirements of paragraph 7.6.93, may calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure 
amount for a securitisation exposure –  
 
(a) 
when the SEC-IRBA is used, by applying the provisions in paragraph 
7.6.99 instead of paragraph 7.6.42; 
 
(b) 
when the SEC-ERBA is used, by applying the provisions in paragraphs 
7.6.100 and 7.6.101 instead of paragraphs 7.6.48 and 7.6.49 
respectively; 
 
(c)  when the SEC-IAA is used, by applying the provisions in paragraph 
7.6.102 instead of paragraph 7.6.61; and 
 
315  
For example, deficiencies in the frequency and content of the investor reports, deficiencies in the alignment 
of interest, or changes in the transaction documentation. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-146  
 
(d) 
when the SEC-SA is used, by applying the provisions in paragraphs 
7.6.103 and 7.6.104 instead of paragraphs 7.6.76 and 7.6.77 
respectively. 
 
7.6.98 
Under the SEC-IRBA, SEC-ERBA, SEC-IAA and SEC-SA, the resulting risk weight 
is subject to a minimum risk weight of 10% for senior securitisation tranches, and 15% 
for non-senior securitisation tranches. 
 
 
Alternative Capital Treatment for STC Securitisations under the SEC-IRBA  
 
7.6.99 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the supervisory parameter p for a 
securitisation exposure which meets the requirements of paragraph 7.6.93 under the 
SEC-IRBA as –  
 
p = max [0.3, 0.5 × (𝐴+ 
𝐵
𝑁+ (𝐶× 𝐾𝐼𝑅𝐵) + (𝐷× 𝐿𝐺𝐷𝑎𝑣𝑔) + (𝐸× 𝑀𝑇))]  
 
where – 
 
(a) 
0.3 denotes the floor of the supervisory parameter p; 
 
(b) 
N is the effective number of exposures in the underlying pool calculated 
in accordance with paragraphs 7.6.38, 7.6.40 and 7.6.41; 
 
(c) 
KIRB is the IRBA capital requirement of the entire portfolio of underlying 
exposures per dollar value of exposure calculated in accordance with 
paragraphs 7.6.21 to 7.6.32; 
 
(d) 
LGDavg is the exposure-weighted average LGD of the underlying pool 
calculated in accordance with paragraphs 7.6.39 to 7.6.41; 
 
(e) 
MT is the tranche maturity calculated in accordance with Section 6 of 
Annex 7V; and 
 
(f) 
the parameters A, B, C, D and E are determined according to Table 7-31.

Short-Term External Credit Assessments 
 
7.6.100 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-ERBA for a securitisation exposure which meets 
the requirements of paragraph 7.6.93 must assign a securitisation exposure for which a 
short-term external credit assessment or an inferred credit assessment based on a short-
term external credit assessment is available, to a credit quality grade in accordance with 
Table 7M-4. Subject to paragraph 7.6.54, the Reporting Bank must risk-weight the 
securitisation exposure in accordance with Table 7-32 and paragraph 7.6.53. The 
Reporting Bank must subject the resulting risk weight to a floor of 10% for senior 
securitisation tranches, and 15% for non-senior securitisation tranches.

long-term external credit assessment or an inferred credit assessment based on a long-
term external credit assessment is available, to a credit quality grade in accordance with 
Table 7M-3. Subject to paragraph 7.6.54, the Reporting Bank must risk-weight the 
securitisation exposure in accordance with Table 7-33 and paragraph 7.6.53, with the risk 
weight adjusted for tranche maturity and tranche thickness (for non-senior tranches) in 
accordance with paragraphs 7.6.50 to 7.6.52. The Reporting Bank must subject the 
resulting risk weight to a floor of 10% for senior securitisation tranches, and 15% for non-
senior securitisation tranches.

Alternative Capital Treatment for STC Securitisations under the SEC-IAA 
 
7.6.102 
A Reporting Bank using the SEC-IAA for a securitisation exposure which meets 
the requirements of paragraph 7.6.93 must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure 
amount for an unrated securitisation exposure to an ABCP programme by – 
 
(a) 
assigning an internal rating, mapped to an equivalent short-term external 
credit assessment or long-term external credit assessment, to the unrated 
securitisation exposure;  
 
(b) 
allocating the risk weight appropriate to the equivalent short-term 
external credit assessment or long-term external credit assessment 
assigned to that exposure in accordance with Table 7-32 or 7-33 
respectively, except where the equivalent short-term external credit 
assessment does not map to a short-term credit quality grade of “III” or 
better as set out in Table 7M-4 or where the equivalent long-term external 
credit assessment does not map to a credit quality grade of “10” or better 
as set out in Table 7M-3, in which case the Reporting Bank must apply a 
1250% risk weight to the unrated securitisation exposure; and  
 
(c) 
applying the formula in paragraph 7.1.14. 
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-149  
Alternative Capital Treatment for STC Securitisations under the SEC-SA 
 
7.6.103 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.6.97, the supervisory parameter p for a 
securitisation exposure which meets the requirements of paragraph 7.6.93 under the 
SEC-SA is 0.5. 
 
7.6.104 
Subject to paragraph 7.6.79, a Reporting Bank must risk-weight any 
securitisation exposure for which it is using the SEC-SA in accordance with paragraph 
7.6.78 and the following:  
 
(a) 
when the tranche detachment point, D for a securitisation exposure is less 
than or equal to KA, the risk weight is 1250%; 
 
(b) 
when the tranche attachment point, A for a securitisation exposure is 
greater than or equal to KA, the risk weight of the exposure, expressed as 
a percentage, is 𝐾𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐴(𝐾𝐴) multiplied by 12.5;  
 
(c) 
when KA is more than A but less than D, the risk weight is the weighted 
average of 1250% and 𝐾𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐴(𝐾𝐴)  multiplied by 12.5 according to the 
following formula:  
 
𝑅𝑊= [(𝐾𝐴−𝐴
𝐷−𝐴) × 12.5] + [(𝐷−𝐾𝐴
𝐷−𝐴) × 12.5 × 𝐾𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐴(𝐾𝐴) ] 
 
The Reporting Bank must then subject the resulting risk weight to a floor of 10% for senior 
securitisation tranches, and 15% for non-senior securitisation tranches. 
 
 
Sub-division 12: Implicit Support 
 
7.6.105 
When a Reporting Bank provides implicit support to a securitisation, it must – 
 
(a) 
include all the underlying exposures of the securitisation in its calculation 
of credit RWA as if those exposures had not been securitised; 
 
(b) 
deduct from CET1 capital any increase in equity capital due to a gain on 
sale, in accordance with paragraph 6.1.5(f); and 
 
(c) 
publicly disclose that it has provided non-contractual support and the 
capital impact of doing so. 
 
 
Sub-division 13: Treatment of Credit Risk Mitigation 
 
7.6.106 
A Reporting Bank may recognise the effects of CRM of eligible financial collateral 
pledged by any SPE, but it must not recognise any SPE as an eligible protection provider. 
 
7.6.107 
 A Reporting Bank that synthetically securitises exposures held on its balance 
sheet by purchasing tranched credit protection must treat currency mismatches and 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-150  
maturity mismatches316 between the synthetic securitisation and the underlying exposures 
in the following manner:  
 
(a) 
for securitisation exposures that are assigned a risk weight of 1250%, 
currency mismatches and maturity mismatches are not taken into 
account;  
 
(b) 
for all other securitisation exposures, the Reporting Bank must treat a 
currency mismatch or a maturity mismatch between the underlying 
exposure being hedged and the CRM obtained through the synthetic 
securitisation in accordance with Annex 7H. In the case where the 
exposures in the underlying pool have different maturities, the Reporting 
Bank must use the longest maturity of all the exposures in the underlying 
pool as the maturity of the pool. 
 
 
Recognition of Eligible Financial Collateral under FC(SA) 
 
7.6.108 
A Reporting Bank which has taken eligible financial collateral must ensure that 
the eligible financial collateral is pledged for at least the life of the exposure, and must 
mark-to-market and revalue the eligible financial collateral at least on a 6-monthly basis, 
or more frequently if specified by the Authority, before recognising the effects of CRM of 
the eligible financial collateral under the FC(SA). A Reporting Bank which has taken eligible 
financial collateral for an SEC-ERBA, SEC-IAA or SEC-SA exposure and is using the FC(SA) 
may recognise the effects of CRM of the eligible financial collateral in the following manner:  
 
(a) 
break down the securitisation exposure into – 
 
(i) 
a collateralised portion with E equal to the latest fair market value of 
the eligible financial collateral; and 
 
(ii) 
an uncollateralised portion with E equal to the E of the securitisation 
exposure less the latest fair market value of the eligible financial 
collateral; 
 
(b) 
apply the risk weight that is applicable to the eligible financial collateral, 
to the collateralised portion calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph 
(a)(i) to calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount of the 
collateralised portion as though the Reporting Bank had a direct exposure 
to the eligible financial collateral;  
 
(c) 
apply the risk weight that is applicable to the securitisation exposure, 
calculated in accordance with paragraph 7.1.23, to the uncollateralised 
portion calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph (a)(ii) to calculate 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount of the uncollateralised portion. 
 
 
 
316  
For example, maturity mismatches may arise when a Reporting Bank uses credit derivatives to transfer 
part or all of the credit risk of a specific pool of assets to third parties. When the credit derivatives unwind, 
the transaction terminates. This implies that the effective maturity of the tranches of the synthetic 
securitisation may differ from that of the underlying exposures.  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-151  
Treatment of Eligible Credit Protection Bought 
 
7.6.109 
A Reporting Bank which has bought eligible credit protection for a securitisation 
exposure from an eligible protection provider may recognise the effects of CRM of the 
eligible credit protection in the following manner:    
 
(a) 
break down the securitisation exposure into – 
 
(i) 
a protected portion with E or EAD equal to the notional amount of 
the eligible credit protection; and 
 
(ii)  an unprotected portion with E or EAD equal to the value of the 
securitisation exposure measured in accordance with Division 2 of 
this Part less the notional amount of the eligible credit protection;  
 
(b) 
apply the risk weight that is applicable to the eligible protection provider 
to the protected portion calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph (a)(i) 
to calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount of the protected 
portion;  
 
(c)  apply the risk weight, calculated in accordance with paragraph 7.1.23, that 
is applicable to the securitisation exposure to the unprotected portion 
calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph (a)(ii) to calculate the credit 
risk-weighted exposure amount of the unprotected portion. 
 
7.6.110 
A Reporting Bank must apply a 1250% risk weight to a securitisation exposure 
below a materiality threshold317 for which no payment will be made by the protection 
provider in the event of loss on a securitisation exposure. 
 
7.6.111 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.6.109, a Reporting Bank must apply the 
relevant provisions in Annex 7I for the purposes of determining the protected portion and 
capital requirement in cases of proportional cover, principal-only cover, partially eligible 
credit derivatives, tranched cover and basket credit derivatives.  
 
7.6.112 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.6.109, a Reporting Bank must treat the 
protected portion of a securitisation exposure which has a currency mismatch or a maturity 
mismatch in accordance with Annex 7H. In the case where the underlying exposure in the 
protected portion of a securitisation has different maturities, the Reporting Bank must use 
the longest maturity as the maturity of the protected portion. 
 
 
Treatment of Credit Protection Sold 
 
7.6.113 
Where a Reporting Bank provides full (or pro rata) unfunded credit protection 
to a securitisation exposure, the Reporting Bank must calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount for the covered portion of the securitisation exposure as if it were directly 
holding that portion of the exposure. Where a Reporting Bank provides tranched cover to 
a securitisation exposure, the Reporting Bank must calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount for the covered portion of the securitisation exposure in accordance with 
paragraphs 1.5 to 1.11 of Annex 7I.  
 
317  
An exposure below such threshold is equivalent to a retained first loss position. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-152  
 
7.6.114 
Where a Reporting Bank provides funded credit protection to a securitisation 
exposure, the Reporting Bank must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
for the credit protection as the sum of – 
 
(a) 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the covered securitisation 
exposure calculated in accordance with paragraph 7.6.113; and  
 
(b) 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the exposure to the 
protection buyer calculated using the risk weight which is applicable to the 
protection buyer, 
 
subject to the condition that the minimum capital requirements for the sum of the credit 
risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) must not 
exceed the notional amount of the credit protection, which is the maximum possible 
payout under the credit protection.

Division 7: Exposures to Central Counterparties  
 
Sub-division 1: Overview 
 
7.7.1 
Subject to paragraph 7.7.2, a Reporting Bank must include in the calculation of 
its CCP RWA exposures to CCPs arising from all of the following transactions:  
  
(a) 
OTC derivative transactions; 
 
(b) 
exchange-traded derivative transactions;  
 
(c) 
SFTs;  
 
(d) 
long settlement transactions. 
 
Where the clearing member-to-client leg of an exchange-traded derivative transaction is 
conducted under a bilateral agreement, a Reporting Bank must, whether it is a clearing 
member or a client in the transaction, or a lower level client or higher level client in the 
case of a multi-level client structure, capitalise that transaction as an OTC derivative 
transaction in accordance with Sub-division 5 of Division 1 of this Part and calculate CVA 
RWA for such exposures in accordance with Division 5 of Part VIII.  
 
7.7.2 
A Reporting Bank must not include, in the calculation of its CCP RWA, exposures 
arising from the settlement of cash transactions318, which are subject to the requirements 
in Division 8 of this Part. 
 
7.7.3 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the CCP meets all of the following 
requirements in order to be treated as a qualifying CCP: 
 
(a)  the CCP holds a licence to operate as a CCP (including a licence granted 
by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted by a financial 
services regulatory authority to operate as a CCP with respect to the 
products it offers;  
 
(b) 
the CCP is based and subject to prudential standards and supervision in a 
country or jurisdiction where the financial services regulatory authority 
has established, and publicly indicated that the financial services 
regulatory authority applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic 
rules and regulations that are consistent with the CPSS-IOSCO Principles 
for Financial Market Infrastructures;  
 
(c) 
the requirements in paragraph 7.7.37(a) and (b) are met, to permit the 
Reporting Bank to calculate its capital requirement for default fund 
exposures to the CCP.  
 
7.7.4 
Subject to paragraph 7.7.5, for exposures to a qualifying CCP, a Reporting Bank 
must calculate the CCP RWA for exposures to the CCP as the sum of –  
 
(a) 
RWA for CCP trade exposures calculated in accordance with Sub-division 
2 of this Division; and 
 
318  
Examples include equity, fixed income, spot foreign exchange and spot commodity transactions. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-154  
 
(b) 
RWA for default fund exposures, calculated as the capital requirement 
calculated in accordance with Sub-division 3 of this Division, multiplied by 
12.5. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must apply a 0% risk weight to 
its contributions to pre-funded default funds covering settlement-risk-only 
products. 
 
7.7.5 
Where a Reporting Bank’s CCP RWA (calculated in accordance with paragraph  
7.7.4) for CCP trade exposures and default fund contribution to a qualifying CCP is higher 
than the CCP RWA (calculated in accordance with paragraph 7.7.6) that would apply if the 
CCP is a non-qualifying CCP, the Reporting Bank must calculate its CCP RWA for CCP trade 
exposures and default fund contribution to the qualifying CCP in accordance with 
paragraph 7.7.6.  
 
7.7.6 
For exposures to a CCP which is not a qualifying CCP, a Reporting Bank must 
calculate the CCP RWA for exposures to the CCP as the sum of –  
 
(a) 
RWA for CCP trade exposures calculated by applying the steps set out in 
paragraph 7.1.9(a) to (e); and  
 
(b)  1250% of default fund exposures, including all pre-funded contributions 
and unfunded contributions which are liable to be paid by the Reporting 
Bank should the CCP so require. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must 
apply a 0% risk weight to its contributions to pre-funded default funds 
covering settlement-risk-only products. 
 
 
7.7.7 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must not include the RWA for CCP trade 
exposures mentioned in paragraph 7.7.6(a) within the CCR-SA RWA of the Reporting Bank. 
 
7.7.8 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.7.6(b), where there is unlimited liability for 
unfunded contributions arising from unlimited binding commitments of a Reporting Bank 
to the default fund of any CCP, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the amount of 
unfunded commitments to which the 1250% risk weight applies is determined by the 
Authority.  
 
7.7.9 
For exposures to a CCP which operates in a country or jurisdiction that does not 
have a financial services regulatory authority applying the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for 
Financial Market Infrastructures, a Reporting Bank must calculate the CCP RWA for 
exposures to the CCP in accordance with paragraph 7.7.6, unless the Authority determines 
otherwise. 
 
7.7.10 
Where a CCP (for which CCP RWA had been calculated in accordance with 
paragraph 7.7.4) ceases to meet the requirements to be treated as a qualifying CCP set 
out in paragraph 7.7.3, a Reporting Bank must, within 3 months of the CCP ceasing to 
meet the requirements to be treated as a qualifying CCP set out in paragraph 7.7.3, 
calculate the CCP RWA for exposures to the CCP in accordance with paragraph 7.7.4, 
unless the Authority requires otherwise. After the 3 months, the Reporting Bank must 
calculate the CCP RWA for exposures to the CCP in accordance with paragraph 7.7.6. 
 
7.7.11 
Despite paragraphs 7.7.3, 7.7.4 and 7.7.6 and regardless of whether a CCP is 
treated as a qualifying CCP, a Reporting Bank must ensure that it maintains adequate 
capital for its exposures to a CCP and must consider as part of its ICAAP under Part X if it 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-155  
should hold capital in excess of the requirements set out in paragraphs 7.7.4 and 7.7.6, 
including where –  
 
(a) 
its transactions with the CCP give rise to exposures that pose higher risks;  
 
(b) 
given the context of that Reporting Bank’s dealings with the CCP, it is 
unclear that the CCP meets the requirements specified in paragraph 7.7.3; 
or  
 
(c) 
an external assessment 319 has found shortcomings in the CCP or the 
regulation of CCPs, and the CCP or the financial services regulatory 
authority supervising the CCP has not since publicly addressed the issues 
identified. 
 
7.7.12 
Where a Reporting Bank acts as a clearing member of a CCP, it must assess 
through appropriate scenario analysis and stress testing whether the level of capital held 
against exposures to a CCP adequately addresses the inherent risks of those transactions. 
The Reporting Bank must include, in the assessment, potential future or contingent 
exposures resulting from future drawings on default fund commitments, and from 
secondary commitments to take over or replace offsetting transactions from clients of 
another clearing member in case of that clearing member defaulting or becoming insolvent. 
 
7.7.13 
A Reporting Bank must monitor and report to senior management and the 
appropriate committee of the Board of the Reporting Bank on a regular basis all its 
exposures to CCPs, which must include exposures arising from trading through a CCP and 
exposures arising from CCP membership obligations, including default fund contributions. 
 
7.7.14 
In the case where a CCP (i.e. second CCP) is treated as a clearing member of 
another CCP (i.e. first CCP), a Reporting Bank must determine whether the second CCP’s 
collateral contribution to the first CCP is treated as initial margin or a default fund 
contribution based upon the legal arrangement between the CCPs, and must consult the 
Authority on its determination.  
 
 
Sub-division 2: CCP Trade Exposures to Qualifying CCPs 
 
Exposures to a CCP where a Reporting Bank is a Clearing Member 
 
7.7.15 
Where a Reporting Bank acts as a clearing member of a CCP for its own 
purposes, the Reporting Bank must calculate its RWA for CCP trade exposures as 2% of E 
or EAD, whichever is applicable, of the Reporting Bank’s CCP trade exposures to the CCP. 
Where a Reporting Bank which acts as a clearing member of a CCP offers clearing services 
to clients, the Reporting Bank must calculate its RWA for CCP trade exposures as 2% of E 
or EAD, whichever is applicable, of the Reporting Bank’s CCP trade exposures to the CCP, 
that arises when the Reporting Bank is obligated to reimburse the client for any losses due 
to changes in the value of its transactions in the event that the CCP defaults. The Reporting 
Bank must calculate its RWA for collateral posted to the CCP in accordance with paragraphs 
7.7.25 to 7.7.33.  
 
 
319  
For example, a Financial Sector Assessment Program by the International Monetary Fund. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-156  
7.7.16 
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.7.15 and 7.7.20 to 7.7.23, a Reporting Bank 
must calculate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, of the CCP trade exposures in accordance 
with paragraphs 7.7.17 to 7.7.19. 
 
7.7.17 
A Reporting Bank must calculate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, of the CCP 
trade exposures in accordance with Sub-divisions 6, 7 or 8, whichever is applicable, and 
Sub-division 9 of Division 2 of this Part. A Reporting Bank must apply the method for 
calculating E or EAD, whichever is applicable, of CCP trade exposures consistently as that 
applied for the Reporting Bank’s measurement of its other pre-settlement counterparty 
exposures. 
 
7.7.18 
A Reporting Bank that is calculating E or EAD, whichever is applicable in 
accordance with paragraph 7.7.17 must comply with all the following requirements: 
 
(a)  where the number of transactions exceeds 5,000 at any point during a 
quarter, the Reporting Bank must not apply the 20-business day floor for 
the margin period of risk and the minimum holding period for a netting 
set as set out in paragraph 6.2 of Annex 7E and Table 7J-3, if there are 
no disputed transactions within the netting set and the netting set does 
not contain any illiquid collateral or exotic transactions; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must, in all cases, apply a minimum margin period of 
risk of 10 business days to the calculation of RWA for CCP trade exposures 
for OTC derivative transactions; 
 
(c)  where CCPs retain variation margin against certain transactions and 
collateral posted by a clearing member is not protected against the 
insolvency of the CCP, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the minimum 
time risk horizon applied to the Reporting Bank’s CCP trade exposures on 
such trades is the lesser of one year and the remaining maturity of the 
transaction, subject to a floor of 10 business days. 
 
7.7.19 
Where the settlement of transactions is legally enforceable on a net basis in an 
event of default, regardless of whether the counterparty is insolvent or bankrupt, a 
Reporting Bank may calculate the total replacement cost of all contracts relevant to the 
calculation of E or EAD, whichever is applicable, of CCP trade exposures as a net 
replacement cost if the applicable close-out netting sets meet the requirements set out in 
Annex 7G, applied to any netting agreement that provides legally enforceable rights of 
set-off320. If the Reporting Bank is not able to ensure that the netting agreements meet 
these requirements, the Reporting Bank must regard each single transaction as a netting 
set of its own for the calculation of CCP trade exposures. 
 
 
Exposures to a CCP where a Reporting Bank is a Client of a Clearing Member 
 
7.7.20 
Where a Reporting Bank is a client of a clearing member or a lower level client 
in a multi-level client structure, and enters into a transaction with the clearing member or 
a higher level client acting as a financial intermediary (i.e. the clearing member or higher 
 
320 
This takes into account that for netting agreements employed by CCPs, no standardisation has currently 
emerged that would be comparable to level of standardisation with respect to netting agreements for 
bilateral trading of OTC derivative transactions. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-157  
level client completes an offsetting transaction with a CCP or clearing member), or enters 
into a transaction with a CCP with a clearing member or higher level client guaranteeing 
the performance of the Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank must treat the exposure 
arising from the transaction as a CCP trade exposure and calculate the RWA for such CCP 
trade exposures in accordance with paragraphs 7.7.15 to 7.7.19 if the following conditions 
are met: 
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank must confirm that the offsetting transaction is 
identified by the CCP as a client transaction; 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank must obtain a written independent legal opinion which 
concludes321 that – 
 
(i)  
the collateral is held by the CCP or the clearing member, or both, to 
support the offsetting transaction, under one or more arrangements 
that prevent any losses to the Reporting Bank due to –  
 
(A)  the default or insolvency of the clearing member; 
 
(B)  the default or insolvency of the other clients of the clearing 
member; and 
 
(C)  the joint default or insolvency of the clearing member and any 
of its other clients;  
 
(ii) 
under the arrangements in sub-paragraph (b)(i), upon the 
insolvency of the clearing member, there is no legal impediment 
(other than the need to obtain a court order to which the client is 
entitled) to the transfer of the collateral belonging to clients of a 
defaulting clearing member of the CCP, to one or more other 
surviving clearing members of the CCP, or to clients or their 
respective nominees;322 and 
 
(iii)  the arrangements in sub-paragraph (b)(i) are binding on all relevant 
parties and legally enforceable in all relevant countries or 
jurisdictions within the meaning of paragraph 3.1(a) of Annex 7G; 
 
(c)  the Reporting Bank must ensure that the arrangements in sub-paragraph 
(b)(i) do not cease to be enforceable and there continues to be no legal 
impediment under sub-paragraph (b)(ii);  
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the laws, regulation, rules, 
contractual arrangements and administrative arrangements, that govern 
the transaction between the Reporting Bank and the clearing member, 
higher level client or CCP, as the case may be – 
 
 
321  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal counsel, the Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel is independent of the parties originating the transactions which the Reporting Bank enters 
into with a clearing member, higher level client or CCP as specified in paragraph 7.7.20. 
322  
The Reporting Bank should consult the Authority to determine if this is achieved based on particular facts. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-158  
(i)  
provide that the offsetting transaction with a clearing member that 
has defaulted, or an insolvent clearing member, will continue to be 
indirectly transacted through the CCP, or by the CCP, should the 
clearing member default or become insolvent; and  
 
 
(ii)  allow for the Reporting Bank’s positions and collateral placed with 
the CCP to be transferred at market value unless the Reporting Bank 
requests to close out at market value. 
 
7.7.21 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.7.20(d), a Reporting Bank must consider all of 
the following factors when assessing if offsetting transactions will continue to be indirectly 
transacted: 
   
(a)  whether there is a precedent for transactions being ported to another 
clearing member of the CCP; 
 
(b)  whether there is any reason for the Reporting Bank to believe that the 
industry practice for such precedent to continue, will be changed. 
 
The Reporting Bank must not determine that the criteria in paragraph 7.7.20(d)(i) and (ii) 
are met solely on the basis that there is no prohibition against the porting of client trades 
in any documentation provided by the CCP, including in rules imposed by or agreements 
entered into with, the CCP, that govern transactions transacted with or through the CCP. 
 
7.7.22  
Where a Reporting Bank is a lower level client in a multi-level client structure, 
the Reporting Bank must apply the capital treatment specified in paragraph 7.7.20 to 
exposures arising from transactions with the higher level client acting as a financial 
intermediary or exposures arising from transactions with a CCP with a higher level client 
guaranteeing the performance of the Reporting Bank, if the conditions set out in paragraph 
7.7.20(a) to (d) are met by all the client levels in-between the Reporting Bank and the 
clearing member.  
 
7.7.23 
Despite paragraph 7.7.20, where a Reporting Bank is a client of a clearing 
member or lower level client in a multi-level client structure, the Reporting Bank must 
calculate the RWA for CCP trade exposures to the clearing member or to the higher level 
client as 4% of E or EAD, whichever is applicable, of the CCP trade exposures if all 
conditions set out in paragraph 7.7.20, other than paragraph 7.7.20(b)(i)(C), are met.  
 
7.7.24  
Where a Reporting Bank is a client of a clearing member or lower level client in 
a multi-level client structure and cannot meet the conditions to apply the treatment in 
paragraphs 7.7.20 and 7.7.23, the Reporting Bank must capitalise its exposure to the 
clearing member or to the higher level client as a bilateral trade and must calculate the 
RWA for such exposures in accordance with Sub-division 5 of Division 1 of this Part and 
calculate CVA RWA for such exposures in accordance with Division 5 of Part VIII.  
 
 
Treatment of Collateral Posted 
 
7.7.25 
Where a Reporting Bank acts as a clearing member of a CCP, the Reporting 
Bank must not be subject to a capital requirement for counterparty credit risk for 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-159  
collateral323 posted by the Reporting Bank that is included in the definition of CCP trade 
exposure, is held by a custodian324 and is bankruptcy remote from the CCP. 
 
7.7.26 
Where a Reporting Bank acts as a clearing member of a CCP, and posts 
collateral with the CCP that is included in the definition of CCP trade exposure, is held at 
the CCP and is not held in a bankruptcy remote manner, the Reporting Bank must calculate 
the CCP RWA for such CCP trade exposures as 2% of E or EAD, whichever is applicable, of 
the collateral posted. However, where a Reporting Bank acts as a clearing member of a 
CCP and collects collateral from a client and posts it to a CCP, and the collateral is not held 
in a bankruptcy remote manner, the Reporting Bank is not subject to capital requirements 
for the posted collateral if the Reporting Bank is not obligated to reimburse the client for 
any loss of such posted collateral in the event that the CCP defaults. 
 
7.7.27  
Where a Reporting Bank posts collateral as a client of a clearing member of a 
CCP and the collateral is included in the definition of CCP trade exposure, is held by a 
custodian and is bankruptcy remote from the CCP, the clearing member and other clients, 
the Reporting Bank need not calculate a capital requirement for counterparty credit risk 
for the collateral posted.  
 
7.7.28  
Where a Reporting Bank posts collateral as a client of a clearing member of the 
CCP and the collateral is included in the definition of CCP trade exposure, is held at the 
CCP on the Reporting Bank’s behalf and is not held in a bankruptcy remote manner, the 
Reporting Bank must calculate the RWA for such CCP trade exposures as – 
 
(a) 
2% of E or EAD, whichever is applicable, of the collateral posted if the 
conditions set out in paragraph 7.7.20 are met; or  
 
(b) 
4% of E or EAD, whichever is applicable, of the collateral posted if all 
conditions set out in paragraph 7.7.20, other than paragraph 
7.7.20(b)(i)(C), are met. 
 
7.7.29 
Where a Reporting Bank posts collateral with a CCP that does not meet the 
definition of CCP trade exposure and is not posted as a default fund contribution, the 
Reporting Bank must include such exposure to the CCP in the calculation of SA(CR) RWA, 
CCR-SA RWA, IRBA RWA or CCR-IRBA RWA, whichever is applicable, and must calculate 
the RWA for such exposures to the CCP in accordance with Sub-division 3, 4 or 5 of Division 
1 of this Part based on the creditworthiness of the CCP. 
 
7.7.30 
Where a Reporting Bank posts collateral as a client of a clearing member of the 
CCP and the collateral is included in the definition of CCP trade exposure and is held at the 
CCP on the Reporting Bank’s behalf, the Reporting Bank must capitalise its exposure to 
the clearing member as a bilateral trade and must calculate the RWA for such exposures 
as the product of the risk weight of the clearing member and E or EAD, whichever is 
applicable, of the collateral posted if – 
  
(a) 
the collateral is not held in a bankruptcy remote manner; and  
 
323   Collateral may include cash, securities, other pledged assets, and excess initial or variation margin (or 
overcollateralisation).  
324  
Custodian may include a trustee, agent, pledgee, secured creditor or any other person that holds property 
in a way that does not give such person a beneficial interest in such property and will not result in such 
property being subject to legally-enforceable claims by the creditors of such persons, or to a court-ordered 
stay of the return of such property, should such person become insolvent or bankrupt. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-160  
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank cannot meet the conditions to apply the treatment in 
paragraph 7.7.28(a) and (b). 
 
7.7.31  
Where a Reporting Bank posts collateral as a client of a clearing member of the 
CCP and the collateral is held at the clearing member and is not held in a bankruptcy 
remote manner, the Reporting Bank must calculate the SA(CR) RWA, IRBA RWA, CCR-SA 
RWA or CCR-IRBA RWA for such exposures to the clearing member by applying the steps 
set out in Sub-division 3, 4 or 5 of Division 1 of this Part based on the creditworthiness of 
the clearing member, to recognise credit risk based upon the collateral being exposed to 
risk of loss. 
 
7.7.32  
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.7.25 to 7.7.31, where a Reporting Bank uses 
the SA-CCR to calculate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for pre-settlement counterparty 
exposures, the Reporting Bank must include collateral that is posted and not held in a 
bankruptcy remote manner in the NICA term in accordance with Annex 7D. Where a 
Reporting Bank uses the CCR Internal Models Method to calculate E or EAD, whichever is 
applicable, for pre-settlement counterparty exposures, the Reporting Bank must apply α 
to the E or EAD measurement of collateral that is posted and not held in a bankruptcy 
remote manner. 
 
7.7.33  
To avoid doubt, for any asset posted as collateral by a Reporting Bank under 
paragraphs 7.7.25 to 7.7.31, the Reporting Bank must also apply the appropriate capital 
treatment that applies to such asset under this Part or Part VIII, as if it had not been 
posted to the CCP.  
 
 
 
Clearing Member Exposures to Clients 
 
7.7.34  
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank that is a clearing member of a CCP must 
capitalise its exposures to clients as bilateral transactions in accordance with Sub-division 
5 of Division 1 of this Part and calculate CVA RWA for such exposures in accordance with 
Division 5 of Part VIII, regardless of whether the Reporting Bank guarantees the trade or 
acts as a financial intermediary between its client and a CCP. To recognise the shorter 
close-out period for cleared transactions, a Reporting Bank that is a clearing member of a 
CCP may capitalise its exposure to its clients applying a margin period of risk of at least 5 
business days in the CCR Internal Models Method or SA-CCR to calculate E or EAD, 
whichever is applicable, for its pre-settlement counterparty exposures to clients in the 
calculation of credit RWA under Sub-division 5 of Division 1 of this Part and the CVA risk 
capital requirement under Division 5 of Part VIII.  
  
7.7.35 
Where a Reporting Bank provides clearing services to clients and passes 
collateral collected from a client to the CCP for trades cleared through a CCP, the Reporting 
Bank may recognise the effects of CRM for such collateral in both capitalisation of 
exposures to the client and the capitalisation of exposures to the CCP. Where the Reporting 
Bank is part of a multi-level client structure, the Reporting Bank may apply the same 
treatment for such collateral to transactions between both lower level clients and higher 
level clients. To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank may, in calculating E or EAD of the 
collateralised transactions with their clients, recognise the effects of CRM of the initial 
margin posted by their clients.

Sub-division 3: Default Fund Exposures 
 
  
7.7.36 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its capital requirement for default fund 
exposures to a qualifying CCP in accordance with paragraphs 7.7.37 to 7.7.45. 
 
7.7.37 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the following requirements are met in 
relation to the calculation of the hypothetical capital requirement of a CCP (“KCCP”), the 
total prefunded default fund contributions from all clearing members (“DFCMpref”), the CCP’s 
prefunded own resources which are contributed to the default waterfall, where these are 
junior or pari passu to prefunded default fund contributions of the CCP’s clearing members 
(“DFCCP”) and the Reporting Bank’s capital requirement for default fund exposures to the 
CCP (“KCM(Bank)”) –  
 
(a) 
the CCP, the financial services regulatory authority supervising the CCP or 
any other entity with access to the required data calculates KCCP, DFCMpref 
and DFCCP, and where the calculation is performed by the CCP or any other 
entity, the CCP or any other entity confirms to the Reporting Bank that 
the calculation is performed in a manner to permit the financial services 
regulatory authority supervising the CCP to oversee the calculation; 
 
(b) 
the CCP, the financial services regulatory authority supervising the CCP or 
any other entity performing the calculations makes available sufficient 
information of the calculation results to the Reporting Bank to permit the 
Reporting Bank to calculate its capital requirement for default fund 
exposures to a CCP (KCM(Bank)) and to permit the Authority to review and 
confirm such calculations; 
 
(c) 
the CCP, the financial services regulatory authority supervising the CCP or 
any other entity performing the calculations, calculates KCCP, DFCMpref and 
DFCCP quarterly at a minimum, or more frequently if so required by the 
Authority in case of material changes325;  
 
(d) 
the CCP, the financial services regulatory authority supervising the CCP or 
any other entity performing the calculations, makes available to the 
Authority sufficient aggregate information about the composition of the 
CCP’s exposures to its clearing members and the information provided to 
the clearing member for the purposes of the calculation of KCCP, DFCMpref 
and DFCCP, at least quarterly or more frequently if the Authority so requires;  
 
(e) 
where the Reporting Bank is a subsidiary of a banking institution 
incorporated outside Singapore, the CCP, the financial services regulatory 
authority supervising the CCP or any other entity performing the 
calculations, makes available to the Authority and to the home bank 
regulatory agency of the Reporting Bank, sufficient aggregate information 
about the composition of the CCP’s exposures to its clearing members and 
the information provided to the clearing member for the purposes of the 
calculation of KCCP, DFCMpref and DFCCP, at least quarterly or more frequently 
if the Authority or the home bank regulatory agency of the Reporting Bank 
so requires; and  
 
 
325  
For example, the clearing of a new product by the CCP. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-162  
(f) 
the CCP, the financial services regulatory authority supervising the CCP or 
any other entity performing the calculations must calculate KCCP, DFCMpref , 
DFCCP and KCM(Bank) at least quarterly, and whenever there are material 
changes to the number or exposures of transactions cleared by the CCP 
or material changes to the financial resources of the CCP.  
  
7.7.38 
Where a default fund of a CCP is shared between products or types of business 
with settlement risk only326 and products or types of business which give rise to CCR (i.e. 
OTC derivative transactions, exchange-traded derivative transactions, SFTs or long 
settlement transactions), a Reporting Bank must calculate the capital requirement for all 
default fund exposures of the Reporting Bank to the CCP in accordance with paragraphs 
7.7.40 to 7.7.45, without apportioning to the different classes or types of business or 
products.  
 
7.7.39 
Where the contributions from clearing members to a default fund of a CCP are 
segregated by product types and only accessible for specific product types, a Reporting 
Bank must calculate the capital requirement for the default fund exposures of the 
Reporting Bank to the CCP in accordance with paragraphs 7.7.40 to 7.7.45 for each specific 
product giving rise to CCR. A Reporting Bank must obtain a confirmation from the CCP, 
the financial services regulatory authority supervising the CCP or any other entity 
performing the calculations of KCCP, DFCMpref and DFCCP that in the case where the CCP’s 
prefunded own resources are shared among the specific product types, the CCP has 
allocated those funds to each of the calculations of KCCP, DFCMpref and DFCCP, in proportion 
to the respective product-specific EAD.  
 
7.7.40 
The calculation of a Reporting Bank’s capital requirement for default fund 
exposures to a CCP, 𝐾𝐶𝑀(𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘), using the formulae327 in paragraphs 7.7.41 to 7.7.45 may 
be performed by the Reporting Bank, the CCP, the financial services regulatory authority 
supervising the CCP or any other entity with access to the required data, where the 
requirements in paragraph 7.7.37 are met.  
 
 
Calculation of the CCP’s Hypothetical Capital Requirement 
 
7.7.41 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that KCCP is calculated in accordance with the 
following formula: 
 
𝐾𝐶𝐶𝑃= ∑𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑖
𝑖
× 20% × 8% 
 
where – 
 
 
326  
For example, equities and bonds. 
327  
The formulae considers the size and quality of a qualifying CCP’s financial resources, the counterparty credit 
risk exposures of such CCP, and the application of such resources via the CCP’s loss bearing waterfall, in 
the case of one or more clearing member defaults.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-163  
(a) 
KCCP is the hypothetical capital requirement of the CCP due to its 
counterparty credit risk exposures to all its clearing members and their 
clients328; and 
 
(b) 
EADi is the exposure value of the CCP to clearing member ‘i’, including 
both the clearing member’s own transactions and client transactions 
guaranteed by the clearing member, and all values of collateral held by 
the CCP (including the clearing member’s prefunded default fund 
contribution) against these transactions, relating to the valuation at the 
end of the reporting date set out in Part XII before the margin called on 
the final margin call of that day is exchanged. The Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the exposure value of the CCP is calculated by aggregating all 
clearing member accounts.  
 
7.7.42 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.7.41 –  
 
(a) 
where a clearing member provides client clearing services, and client 
transactions and collateral are held in separate (individual or omnibus) 
sub-accounts to the clearing member’s proprietary business, the 
transactions and collateral in each such client sub-account must be 
included in the sum of EADi separately. The exposure value of the CCP to 
a clearing member “i” is the sum of the exposure values of the client sub-
accounts and the exposure value of any house sub-account.329 If any of 
these sub-accounts contains both derivative transactions and SFTs, the 
exposure value of that sub-account is the sum of the exposure values of 
the derivative transactions and the exposure values of the SFTs;  
 
(b) 
where collateral is held by the CCP against a clearing member account or 
client sub-account containing both derivative transactions and SFTs, the 
prefunded initial margin provided by the clearing member or client of a 
clearing member must be allocated to the exposure values of the SFTs 
and derivative transactions in proportion to the respective product specific 
exposure values, calculated in accordance with – 
 
(i)  
paragraphs 1.3 to 1.5 of Annex 7J, and applying the standard 
supervisory haircuts in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.5 of Annex 7J for SFTs; 
and  
 
(ii) 
SA-CCR under Annex 7D without including the recognition of the 
effect of collateral, for derivative transactions; 
 
(c) 
where the default fund contributions of a clearing member are not split 
with regards to client sub-accounts and house sub-accounts, such default 
fund contributions are to be allocated per sub-account according to the 
respective fraction the initial margin of the sub-account has in relation to 
the total initial margin posted by or for the account of the clearing member; 
  
 
328  
KCCP is calculated on a consistent basis for the sole purpose of determining the capitalisation of clearing 
member default fund contributions; it does not represent the actual capital requirements for a CCP which 
may be determined by a CCP and its supervisor. 
329  
This ensures that the collateral posted by the client and held at the CCP cannot be used to offset the CCP’s 
exposures to clearing members’ proprietary activity in the calculation of KCCP.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-164  
(d) 
the netting sets that are applicable to regulated clearing members are the 
same as those referred to in paragraph 7.7.19. For unregulated clearing 
members, the netting rules of the CCP notified to its clearing members 
must apply. The Authority may from time to time, specify more granular 
netting sets than laid out by the CCP; and 
 
(e) 
the Authority may from time to time, specify a risk weight higher than 
20% taking into account, among other things, the creditworthiness of the 
clearing members of the CCP330. The Reporting Bank must communicate 
any such increase in risk weight to the CCP, the financial services 
regulatory authority supervising the CCP or any other entity performing 
the calculation of KCCP.  
 
7.7.43 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.7.41(b) – 
 
(a) 
EADi for derivative transactions is calculated using the SA-CCR in 
accordance with Annex 7D as the bilateral trade exposure the CCP has 
against the clearing member ‘i’;  
 
(b) 
in applying the SA-CCR –  
 
(i) 
a margin period of risk of 10 business days must apply. To avoid 
doubt, the 20 business days floor on the margin period of risk for 
netting sets where the number of trades exceeds 5,000 at any point 
in a quarter, does not apply; and  
 
(ii) 
all collateral held by the CCP to which the CCP has a legal claim in 
the event of the default of clearing member ‘i’ or its client, including 
default fund contributions of clearing member ‘i’, may be used to 
offset the CCP’s exposure to clearing member ‘i’ or its client through 
inclusion in the multiplier set out in paragraph 3.1 of Annex 7D; and  
 
(c) 
EADi for SFTs is equal to max (𝐸𝐵𝑅𝑀𝑖−𝐼𝑀𝑖−𝐷𝐹𝑖; 0), 
 
 
where –  
 
(i) 
EBRMi is the exposure value to clearing member ‘i’ before credit risk 
mitigation, in accordance with paragraphs 1.3 to 1.5 of Annex 7J, 
and applying the standard supervisory haircuts in paragraphs 2.1 
and 2.5 of Annex 7J for SFTs. For the purposes of this calculation, 
variation margin that has been exchanged (before the margin called 
on the final margin call of that day) enters into the mark-to-market 
value of the transactions;  
 
(ii) 
IMi is the initial margin collateral posted by the clearing member ‘i’ 
with the CCP; and 
 
(iii) DFi is the prefunded default fund contribution by the clearing 
member ‘i’ that will be applied upon the default of the clearing 
 
330  
An increase in such risk weight may be considered if, for example, the clearing members in a CCP are not 
highly rated.

member, either along with or immediately following the initial margin 
posted by the clearing member, to reduce the CCP’s loss. 
 
 
Calculation of the Capital Requirement for a Reporting Bank’s default fund 
exposures to a CCP   
 
7.7.44 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its capital requirement for default fund 
exposures to a CCP in accordance with the following formula, where a 2% risk weight floor 
is applied to the default fund exposure: 
 
𝐾𝐶𝑀(𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘) =  max (𝐾𝐶𝐶𝑃×
𝐷𝐹𝐶𝑀 (𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘)
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓
𝐷𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑃+ 𝐷𝐹𝐶𝑀
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓; 8% × 2% × 𝐷𝐹𝐶𝑀 (𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘)
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓
) 
 
where –  
 
(a) 𝐾𝐶𝑀(𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘) is the Reporting Bank’s capital requirement for default fund 
exposures to the CCP; 
 
(b) 𝐷𝐹𝐶𝑀
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓 is the total prefunded default fund contributions from all clearing 
members;  
 
(c) 𝐷𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑃 is the CCP’s prefunded own resources, comprising contributed 
capital, retained earnings and other resources approved by the financial 
services regulatory authority supervising the CCP, which are contributed 
to the default waterfall, where these are junior or pari passu to prefunded 
default fund contributions of the CCP’s clearing members; and 
 
(d) 𝐷𝐹𝐶𝑀(𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘)
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓
is the prefunded default fund contribution of the Reporting 
Bank. 
 
7.7.45 
A Reporting Bank need not subject its exposures for collateral posted as default 
fund contributions to a qualifying CCP to haircuts for the purposes of calculating the 
Reporting Bank’s capital requirements for default fund exposures to the CCP as defined in 
paragraph 7.7.44.

Division 8:  UST Exposures 
 
Sub-division 1: Overview  
 
7.8.1 
A Reporting Bank must hold capital for any UST exposure, whether it arises 
from an unsettled DvP transaction or an unsettled non-DvP transaction, irrespective of the 
accounting of the transaction.331  
 
7.8.2 
A Reporting Bank must closely monitor any UST exposure starting from the first 
day it becomes unpaid or undelivered.  
 
7.8.3 
A Reporting Bank must apply Sub-division 2 of this Division to calculate the 
credit RWA for UST exposures arising from unsettled DvP transactions. A Reporting Bank 
must apply Sub-division 3 of this Division to calculate the credit RWA for UST exposures 
arising from unsettled non-DvP transactions. 
 
 
Sub-division 2: Calculation of Credit RWA for UST Exposures Arising from 
Unsettled DvP Transactions  
 
7.8.4 
To calculate its UST-DvP RWA, a Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for each UST exposure 
arising from an unsettled DvP transaction, using the following formula: 
   
Credit RWE = Exposure x RW 
 
where –  
 
(i) 
“Credit RWE” refers to the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for 
the UST exposure arising from that unsettled DvP transaction; 
 
(ii) “Exposure” refers to EDvP for the UST exposure arising from that 
unsettled DvP transaction determined in accordance with paragraph 
7.8.5;  
 
(iii) “RW” refers to the applicable risk weight for the UST exposure arising 
from that unsettled DvP transaction, determined in accordance with 
paragraph 7.8.6; and  
 
(b)  add the credit risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated in accordance 
with sub-paragraph (a) for all its UST exposures arising from unsettled 
DvP transactions.  
 
7.8.5 
A Reporting Bank must determine EDvP for a UST exposure arising from an 
unsettled DvP transaction as the difference between the transaction valued at the agreed 
settlement price and the transaction valued at current market price (i.e. positive current 
exposure), or in the case where the difference is negative, a value of zero. Where such a 
 
331  
The Authority may disapply the applicable capital treatment in this Division if there has been a system-
wide failure of a settlement system, clearing system or CCP that causes significant disruption to normal 
settlement and clearing processes. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-167  
UST exposure does not appear on the balance sheet of a Reporting Bank due to the use 
of settlement date accounting, the Reporting Bank must determine EDvP by multiplying –  
 
(a)  the difference between the transaction valued at the agreed settlement 
price and the transaction valued at current market price, or in the case 
where the difference is negative, a value of zero; and  
 
(b)  a CCF of 100%.  
 
7.8.6 
A Reporting Bank must apply a risk weight to any UST exposure arising from 
an unsettled DvP transaction if the payments have not yet taken place, based on the 
number of business days after the settlement date, in accordance with Table 7-34.

Sub-division 3: Calculation of Credit RWA for UST Exposures Arising from 
Unsettled Non-DvP Transactions  
 
7.8.7 
A Reporting Bank must calculate capital requirements for any UST exposure 
arising from an unsettled non-DvP transaction, and treat the exposure as a loan exposure 
to its counterparty, if the Reporting Bank has fulfilled its obligation under the first 
contractual payment or delivery leg and the second leg has not been received by the end 
of the business day.  
 
7.8.8 
To calculate its UST-non-DvP RWA, a Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for each UST exposure 
arising from an unsettled non-DvP transaction, in accordance with – 
 
(i) 
paragraphs 7.8.10 to 7.8.16, up to and including the fourth business 
day after the second contractual payment or delivery date; and 
 
(ii) 
paragraph 7.8.17, 5 or more business days after the second 
contractual payment or delivery date; and 
 
(b) 
add the credit risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated in accordance 
with sub-paragraph (a) for all its UST exposures arising from unsettled 
non-DvP transactions. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-168  
7.8.9 
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.8.7 and 7.8.8, if the dates when 2 payment 
legs are made are the same according to the time zones where each payment is made, 
the Reporting Bank must deem them to have been settled on the same day.332 
 
 
Calculation of credit risk-weighted exposure amount up to and including the 
fourth business day after the second contractual payment or delivery date 
 
7.8.10 
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.8.11 and 7.8.12 – 
 
(a)  “IRBA exposure” refers to any UST exposure that belongs to a class of 
exposures for which the Reporting Bank has obtained IRBA approval under 
paragraph 7.4.11; and 
 
(b)  “SA(CR) exposure” refers to any UST exposure in any other case. 
 
7.8.11 
For a UST exposure arising from an unsettled non-DvP transaction which is an 
SA(CR) exposure, a Reporting Bank must calculate the credit risk-weight exposure amount 
by –  
(a) 
allocating an applicable credit quality grade and risk weight for the SA(CR) 
exposure in accordance with Sub-divisions 2 and 3 respectively of Division 
3 of this Part, based on the counterparty to the non-DvP transaction; and 
 
(b)  calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the SA(CR) 
exposure using the following formula: 
 
Credit RWE = Exposure x RW 
 
where – 
 
(i)  
“Credit RWE” refers to the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for 
that SA(CR) exposure; 
 
(ii)  “Exposure” refers to Enon-DvP for that SA(CR) exposure, determined in 
accordance with paragraph 7.8.16; and 
 
(iii)  “RW” refers to the applicable risk weight for that SA(CR) exposure 
determined in accordance with sub-paragraph (a). 
 
7.8.12 
For a UST exposure arising from an unsettled non-DvP transaction which is an 
IRBA exposure, a Reporting Bank must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
by either – 
 
(a) 
calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the UST 
exposure in accordance with paragraph 7.8.11(a) and (b); or 
 
(b) 
calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the IRBA 
exposure as follows: 
 
332  
For example, if a bank in Tokyo transfers Yen on day X (Japan Standard Time) and receives corresponding 
USD via the Clear House Interbank Payments System on day X (US Eastern Standard Time), the settlement 
is deemed to have taken place on the same date.

(i) 
if the Reporting Bank is using or would have used the supervisory 
slotting criteria to calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure 
amount –  
 
(A) determining RWslot for that IRBA exposure in accordance with 
the supervisory slotting criteria set out in Annex 7S and 
Sub-division 13 of Division 4 of this Part, based on the 
counterparty to the non-DvP transaction; and 
 
(B)  calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount using the 
following formula: 
 
Credit RWE = Exposure x RWslot 
 
where – 
 
(I)  “Credit RWE” refers to the credit risk-weighted exposure 
amount for that IRBA exposure; 
 
(II)  “Exposure” refers to Enon-DvP for that IRBA exposure, 
determined in accordance with paragraph 7.8.16; and 
 
(III)  “RWslot” refers to RWslot determined in accordance with 
sub-paragraph (b)(i)(A); 
 
(ii) 
in any other case –  
 
(A) calculating Kcorp, Ksm, Ksov, Kbank, Koret, Ksl, or Khv, whichever is 
applicable to the IRBA exposure in accordance with Sub-division 
8 and 9 of Division 4 of this Part, based on the counterparty to 
the non-DvP transaction; and 
 
(B)  calculating the credit risk-weighted exposure amount using the 
following formula: 
 
Credit RWE = Exposure x K x 12.5 
 
where – 
 
(I)  “Credit RWE” refers to the credit risk-weighted exposure 
amount for that IRBA exposure; 
 
(II)  “Exposure” refers to Enon-DvP for that IRBA exposure, 
determined in accordance with paragraph 7.8.16;  
 
(III) “K” refers to Kcorp, Ksm, Ksov, Kbank, Koret, Ksl, or Khv, 
whichever is applicable to that IRBA exposure, calculated 
in accordance with sub-paragraph (b)(ii)(A).  
 
7.8.13 
A Reporting Bank adopting the treatment set out in paragraph 7.8.12(a) must 
do so consistently for all such exposures. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-170  
 
7.8.14 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.8.12(b)(ii), a Reporting Bank may –  
 
(a)  assign a PD for that IRBA exposure on the basis of the counterparty’s 
external credit assessment by recognised ECAIs if the Reporting Bank does 
not have any other banking book exposure to the counterparty to which 
IRBA is applied; or  
 
(b)  where the Reporting Bank is using the A-IRBA, assign an LGD of 45% for 
that IRBA exposure subject to this being applied consistently to all A-IRBA 
exposures arising from unsettled non-DvP transactions.  
 
7.8.15 
Despite paragraphs 7.8.11 and 7.8.12, where the UST exposures arising from 
unsettled non-DvP transactions of a Reporting Bank are not material in aggregate, the 
Reporting Bank may calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the UST 
exposure arising from every unsettled non-DvP transaction by using the following formula:   
   
Credit RWE = Exposure x 100% 
 
where –  
 
(a)  “Credit RWE” refers to the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for that 
UST exposure arising from an unsettled non-DvP transaction;  
 
(b)  “Exposure” refers to Enon-DvP for that UST exposure arising from an 
unsettled non-DvP transaction, determined in accordance with paragraph 
7.8.16.  
 
7.8.16 
Up to and including the fourth business day after the second contractual 
payment or delivery date, a Reporting Bank must determine Enon-DvP for a UST exposure 
arising from an unsettled non-DvP transaction as the full amount of cash paid or 
deliverables delivered. Where such a UST exposure does not appear on the balance sheet 
of a Reporting Bank due to the use of settlement date accounting, the Reporting Bank 
must determine Enon-DvP by multiplying – 
 
(a) 
the full amount of cash paid or deliverables delivered; and 
 
(b) 
a CCF of 100%.  
 
 
Calculation of credit risk-weighted exposure amount 5 or more business days 
after the second contractual payment or delivery date 
 
7.8.17 
If the second leg of a non-DvP transaction has not been received 5 business 
days after the second contractual payment or delivery date, the Reporting Bank must 
calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for a UST exposure arising from such 
an unsettled non-DvP transaction, until the second payment or delivery leg is effectively 
made, using the following formula: 
   
Credit RWE = Exposure x 1250% 
 
where –  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-171  
 
(a)  “Credit RWE” refers to the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for that 
UST exposure arising from an unsettled non-DvP transaction;  
 
(b) 
“Exposure” refers to Enon-DvP for that UST exposure arising from an 
unsettled non-DvP transaction calculated as the full amount of cash paid 
or deliverables delivered, plus the replacement cost, if any. Where such a 
UST exposure does not appear on the balance sheet of a Reporting Bank 
due to the use of settlement date accounting, the Reporting Bank must 
determine Enon-DvP by multiplying – 
 
(i) 
the full amount of cash paid or deliverables delivered, plus 
replacement cost, if any; and 
 
(ii) 
a CCF of 100%. 
 
7.8.18 
For the purposes of paragraphs 7.8.5, 7.8.16 and 7.8.17(b), a Reporting Bank 
must calculate EDvP or Enon-DvP, as the case may be, net of any specific allowance 
attributable to such a UST exposure.

Annex 7A 
 
QUALIFYING ON-BALANCE SHEET NETTING AGREEMENTS 
 
 
Section 1: Introduction 
 
1.1 
A qualifying on-balance sheet netting agreement is a netting agreement 
covering loans and deposits (collectively “Transactions”) between a Reporting Bank and a 
counterparty for which the requirements set out in Sections 2 to 4 of this Annex are 
complied with. 
 
 
Section 2:  Requirements for On-Balance Sheet Netting Agreements 
 
2.1 
A Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
have a well-founded legal basis to conclude that the netting agreement is 
legally enforceable in all relevant countries or jurisdictions regardless of 
whether the counterparty is liquidated, insolvent or bankrupt or other 
similar circumstances;  
 
(b) 
obtain a written independent legal opinion
333  that satisfies the 
requirements set out in paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 of this Annex, confirming 
that the netting agreement is valid, effective and enforceable for each of 
the following countries or jurisdictions: 
 
(i) 
the country or jurisdiction in which the counterparty is incorporated 
or established; 
 
(ii) 
if a foreign branch of the Reporting Bank or the counterparty has 
entered or will be entering into the Transaction, the country or 
jurisdiction in which the branch of the Reporting Bank or the 
counterparty, as the case may be, is located; 
 
(iii) the country or jurisdiction whose law governs the netting agreement;  
 
(iv) the country or jurisdiction whose law governs any Transaction in 
relation to the netting agreement if different from sub-paragraph 
(b)(iii), 
  
(referred to as “relevant countries or jurisdictions” in this Annex) and 
which satisfies the requirements set out in Section 3 of this Annex; and 
 
(c) 
provide to the Authority the information and documents set out in 
paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3 of this Annex. 
 
333  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal counsel, a Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel is independent of the parties originating transactions covered by the on-balance sheet netting 
agreement. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-173  
 
2.2 
A Reporting Bank must provide to the Authority, upon request, a summary 
listing 334 of the source and date of each legal opinion obtained for the purposes of 
paragraph 2.1(b) of this Annex, stating in each case, whether such legal opinion was 
commissioned specifically by the Reporting Bank, by the Reporting Bank collectively with 
any other party, or by some other third party.  
 
2.3 
The Authority may, where it considers it necessary, require a Reporting Bank 
to provide copies of, or access to, the netting agreement and the legal opinions obtained 
for the purposes of paragraph 2.1(b) of this Annex. 
 
 
Section 3:  Legal Opinions obtained for the purposes of paragraph 2.1(b) of this 
Annex 
 
3.1 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the legal opinion –  
 
(a) 
is in the form of a memorandum of law and addressed directly to the 
Reporting Bank or the sponsors of a particular netting agreement or form 
of netting agreement; or 
  
(b) 
is the product of a number of parties (including the Reporting Bank) 
pooling together to seek a collective opinion on a particular netting 
agreement. 
 
3.2 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the legal opinion, at the minimum –  
 
(a) 
confirms that in an event of default as defined under the netting 
agreement, including liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar 
circumstances of either the counterparty or the Reporting Bank, the courts 
and administrative authorities335 of the relevant country or jurisdiction will 
find that the claims and obligations of the Reporting Bank pursuant to the 
relevant Transactions would be limited to a net sum calculated in 
accordance with the netting agreement under the law of the relevant 
country or jurisdiction; 
 
(b) 
highlights the material clauses in the netting agreement that provide for 
the netting of Transactions (“material netting clauses”); 
 
(c) 
confirms that the unenforceability or illegality of any clause (other than a 
material netting clause) in the netting agreement is unlikely to undermine 
the material netting clauses referred to in sub-paragraph (b); 
 
(d) 
states the circumstances under which the netting agreement may be relied 
upon, including – 
 
(i) 
the legal form of, or activities conducted by, the counterparty; and 
 
 
334 
This can be prepared by either an in-house or external legal counsel of the Reporting Bank. 
335  
This includes a court-appointed administrator and an administrator appointed by a regulatory authority. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-174  
(ii) 
whether certain counterparties336 may be subject to special rules 
relating to insolvency as a result of the legal form of, or activities 
conducted by, the counterparties; 
 
(e) 
states whether the netting or other default provisions in the netting 
agreement are enforceable or enforceable differently (and if so, the extent 
of the difference) in a non-liquidation event337; 
 
(f) 
states to what extent, if at all, the netting needs to be reflected in the 
records of the counterparties in order for it to be valid, effective and 
enforceable; 
 
(g) 
states whether a court or administrative authority in the country or 
jurisdiction covered by the legal opinion would uphold the rate chosen for 
the conversion of foreign currency obligations for the purposes of 
calculating the net amount and whether there are any statutory or other 
applicable rules that may affect this aspect of the netting agreement; 
 
(h) 
states whether, under the law of the country or jurisdiction covered by the 
legal opinion, it is necessary for the enforceability of the netting that all 
Transactions be regarded as part of a single agreement, and if so, whether 
there is anything in the netting methodology which may be held to be 
inconsistent with the treatment of all Transactions as part of a single 
agreement and the effect it may have on the netting; 
 
(i) 
states whether there is any reason to believe that the netting agreement 
would be unenforceable because of the law of another country or 
jurisdiction; 
 
(j) 
states whether there are legal problems in exercising any discretion or 
flexibility provided for in the netting agreement, and if so, whether such 
problems affect the enforceability of the netting agreement; and 
 
(k) 
if other clauses are added to a standard form agreement, confirms that 
such additional clauses do not throw any reasonable doubt or affect the 
overall validity, effectiveness or enforceability of the netting agreement. 
 
3.3 
The Authority is aware that it may not be possible for a Reporting Bank to obtain 
a legal opinion that provides a definitive view on the validity, effectiveness and 
enforceability of the netting agreement without certain assumptions or qualifications. The 
presence per se of assumptions and qualifications within the legal opinion will not render 
the legal opinion unsatisfactory for the purposes of this Notice. However, the Reporting 
Bank must ensure that assumptions underlying the legal opinion are not unduly restrictive, 
and are specific, of a factual nature and adequately explained within the legal opinion. 
Where qualifications are made, the Reporting Bank must ensure that such qualifications  
are specific and their effect is adequately explained within the legal opinion. A Reporting 
Bank must examine and assess the assumptions and qualifications in the legal opinion. 
 
 
336  
For example, banks, insurance companies, or local authorities. 
337  
For example, administration, judicial management, receivership, voluntary arrangement, or a scheme of 
arrangement. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-175  
3.4 
If the Reporting Bank determines that –  
 
(a) 
the absence of any of the information listed in paragraph 3.2 of this Annex; 
or 
 
(b) 
any of the assumptions or qualifications in the legal opinion, 
 
gives rise to reasonable doubt as to the validity, effectiveness or enforceability of the 
netting agreement, the Reporting Bank must not treat the netting agreement as a 
qualifying on-balance sheet netting agreement.  
 
3.5 
In this regard, where there is more than one relevant country or jurisdiction in 
relation to a netting agreement, the Reporting Bank must not treat the netting agreement 
as a qualifying on-balance sheet netting agreement, if the Reporting Bank has any 
reasonable doubt, based on its own evaluation of the legal opinions, as to whether the 
netting agreement is valid, effective and enforceable in any relevant country or jurisdiction 
considering the potential for conflicts of laws and whether action may be taken by 
insolvency officials in other countries or jurisdictions.  
 
3.6 
The Reporting Bank must review each legal opinion and obtain updates as 
necessary, including in the form of a fresh legal opinion, confirming that the opinion on 
the validity, effectiveness and enforceability of the netting agreement remains unchanged. 
The Reporting Bank must also document the sources of the legal opinions, and the 
expertise of the persons giving the legal opinions.  
 
3.7 
Despite paragraph 2.1(b) of this Annex, where any relevant country or 
jurisdiction does not recognise netting or recognises netting only in a limited form, the 
Reporting Bank must report Transactions for which that country or jurisdiction is a relevant 
country or jurisdiction on a gross basis. The Reporting Bank may report all other 
Transactions under the same netting agreement on a net basis. 
 
3.8 
Where a Reporting Bank is aware that a supervisory authority of the 
counterparty of the Reporting Bank (whether the supervisory authority is the home or host 
supervisor) is not satisfied that a netting agreement is legally valid, effective or 
enforceable under the law of the country or jurisdiction of that supervisory authority, the 
Reporting Bank must not treat the netting agreement as a qualifying on-balance sheet 
netting agreement, despite any legal opinion obtained by the Reporting Bank. 
 
 
Section 4:  Policies, Systems and Controls 
 
4.1 
A Reporting Bank must have in place a netting policy that sets out, at a 
minimum, all of the following:  
 
(a) 
the person responsible for setting and reviewing the policy on netting; 
 
(b) 
the frequency of review of the netting policy; 
 
(c) 
the person responsible for approving the application of a netting 
agreement to any Transaction (including determining whether the netting 
agreement is covered by an existing legal opinion or whether separate 
legal opinions are required); 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-176  
 
(d) 
how the Reporting Bank monitors legal developments affecting its netting 
agreements and the need to obtain additional legal opinions; 
 
(e) 
what the Reporting Bank is to include in its netting agreements to ensure 
that its interests, rights and obligations are duly reflected;  
 
(f) 
the processes for determining and reporting net exposures to individual 
counterparties. 
 
4.2 
The Reporting Bank must also have in place adequate systems and controls to 
monitor the Transactions, including systems and controls to ensure that –  
 
(a) 
only Transactions entered into by the Reporting Bank with a counterparty 
that are covered by a netting agreement are netted, and such Transactions 
can be determined at any time; 
 
(b) 
net exposures arising from such Transactions subject to netting, including 
net exposures of each branch of the Reporting Bank against each branch 
of the counterparty, where applicable, are monitored and controlled, and 
accurately determined and reported; 
 
(c) 
documentary evidence of the Transactions subject to netting are 
maintained and appropriately safeguarded and the Reporting Bank is able 
to produce such documentary evidence, if required by the Authority; 
 
(d) 
the legal opinions are not superceded by subsequent changes in the laws 
of the relevant countries or jurisdictions, and that all of the following are 
duly documented and updated, as necessary, to ensure the continued 
legal enforceability of such netting agreements:    
 
(i) 
the types of counterparties and Transactions covered by each netting 
agreement;  
 
(ii) 
the relevant countries or jurisdictions for each netting agreement to 
which the Reporting Bank is a party. The Reporting Bank must note 
any country or jurisdiction for which any doubt may exist as to the 
legal validity, effectiveness or enforceability of netting and what 
action the Reporting Bank has taken as a result; 
 
(e) 
counterparty limits are monitored in terms of such net exposures; and 
 
(f) 
roll-off risks are monitored and controlled. The Reporting Bank must only 
net from the loan exposures the amount of deposits which –   
 
(i) 
withdrawal is conditional upon the loan exposures being repaid; and  
 
(ii) 
the condition is stipulated in the contractual agreement338 with the 
counterparty.  
 
338  
Such withdrawal restrictions are intended to safeguard against the withdrawal of deposits prior to a default, 
which would increase the risk of under-capitalisation by a Reporting Bank. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-177  
 
4.3 
For the calculation of the net exposure of loans and deposits, a Reporting Bank 
must apply any applicable currency mismatch haircut or maturity mismatch adjustment 
set out in paragraph 7.2.10(b)(ii) and (iii) to the deposit amount, subject to withdrawal 
conditions. 
 
4.4 
A Reporting Bank must maintain adequate documentation in relation to meeting 
the requirements in Sections 2 and 3 of this Annex at all times.

Reporting Bank has an unconditionally cancellable commitment to issue direct credit substitutes, a 10% 
CCF must be applied (instead of a 100% CCF). 
340  
For example, general guarantees of indebtedness (including standby letters of credit serving as financial 
guarantees for loans and securities), or acceptances (including endorsements with the character of

For any item referred to in item (b) of Table 7B-1, the Reporting Bank must 
risk-weight the item according to the type of asset and not according to the type of 
counterparty with whom the transaction has been entered into. 
 
1.4 
Where the item referred to in item (c) of Table 7B-1 is a forward purchase, 
forward deposit or partly paid security, the Reporting Bank must risk-weight the item 
according to the type of asset and not according to the type of counterparty with whom 
the transaction has been entered into. 
 
1.5 
Where the Reporting Bank makes a commitment to provide a loan that is to be 
drawn down in a number of tranches, the Reporting Bank must classify the commitment 
under item (g) of Table 7B-1 and apply 40% CCF to the full undisbursed portion of the 
loan, regardless of whether the commitment falls within the scope of another item in Table 
7B-1. 
 
1.6 
For any item referred to in item (i) of Table 7B-1, where the Authority assesses 
that a 10% CCF does not adequately capture the exposure arising from such a commitment, 
the Authority may direct the Reporting Bank to apply a higher CCF to the commitment.

Annex 7D 
 
STANDARDISED APPROACH FOR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK (SA-CCR) 
 
 
Section 1: Overview 
 
1.1 
Subject to Section 4 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank using the SA-CCR must 
calculate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for the pre-settlement counterparty exposure 
to a single counterparty arising from OTC derivative transactions or exchange-traded 
derivative transactions, or long settlement transactions separately for each margined and 
unmargined netting set as follows: 
 
𝐸 𝑜𝑟 𝐸𝐴𝐷= 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎× (𝑅𝐶+ 𝑃𝐹𝐸)  
 
where – 
 
(a)  𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 = 1.4; 
 
(b)  𝑅𝐶  = the replacement cost calculated in accordance with Section 2 of 
 
    this Annex; and  
 
(c)  𝑃𝐹𝐸  = the amount for potential future exposure calculated in accordance 
 
   with Section 3 of this Annex. 
 
1.2 
A Reporting Bank may set E or EAD, whichever is applicable, to zero only for 
sold options that are not under a qualifying bilateral netting agreement and margin 
agreement.  
 
1.3 
A Reporting Bank that is a protection seller may cap E or EAD, whichever is 
applicable, to the amount of unpaid premia for credit derivatives that are not under a 
qualifying bilateral netting agreement and margin agreement. A Reporting Bank that is a 
protection seller may remove credit derivatives that are under a qualifying bilateral netting 
agreement from the netting set and treat them as individual unmargined transactions in 
order to apply the cap.  
 
1.4 
A Reporting Bank must calculate RC and PFE differently for margined and 
unmargined netting sets in accordance with Sections 2 to 4 of this Annex. A Reporting 
Bank must cap the E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for a margined netting set, at the E 
or EAD, whichever is applicable of the same netting set, calculated based on the formulas 
for unmargined transactions. 
 
1.5 
If the Authority is not satisfied that the use of the SA-CCR by a Reporting Bank 
captures the risk inherent in the Reporting Bank’s transactions (as could be the case with 
structured and more complex OTC derivative transactions), the Authority may require the 
Reporting Bank to apply the SA-CCR on a transaction-by-transaction basis (i.e. with no 
recognition of netting).  
 
1.6 
For the purposes of this Annex, “derivative transactions” or “derivatives” include 
long settlement transactions.  
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-182  
Section 2: Replacement Cost 
 
2.1 
For unmargined transactions (that is, where variation margin is not exchanged, 
but collateral other than variation margin may be present), a Reporting Bank must 
calculate RC for each netting set using the following formula: 
 
𝑅𝐶= 𝑚𝑎𝑥{𝑉−𝐶; 0} 
 
where – 
 
(a)  𝑉 is the current market value of the derivative transactions in the netting 
set; and  
 
(b)  𝐶 is the haircut value of net collateral held, which in the case of 
unmargined transactions, is NICA adjusted by applying the standard 
supervisory haircuts in Annex 7J such that the value of non-cash collateral 
posted by the Reporting Bank to its counterparty is increased, and the 
value of non-cash collateral received by the Reporting Bank from its 
counterparty is decreased.  
 
2.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
calculate the haircut applicable in the calculation of RC using the formula specified in 
paragraph 3.4 of Annex 7J, applying the minimum holding period for the transaction set 
out in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3 of Annex 7J. In applying the formula, the Reporting Bank 
must use the maturity of the longest transaction in the netting set as the value for 𝑁𝑅, 
capped at 250 days, in order to scale haircuts for unmargined transactions. The Reporting 
Bank must cap the haircut calculated at 100%.  
 
2.3 
A Reporting Bank must treat bilateral transactions with a one-way margining 
agreement in favour of the Reporting Bank’s counterparty (that is, where the Reporting 
Bank posts but does not collect variation margin) as unmargined transactions.  
 
2.4 
For margined transactions, a Reporting Bank must calculate RC for each netting 
set using the following formula: 
 
𝑅𝐶= 𝑚𝑎𝑥{𝑉−𝐶; 𝑇𝐻+ 𝑀𝑇𝐴−𝑁𝐼𝐶𝐴; 0} 
 
where – 
 
(a)  𝑉 is the current market value of the derivative transactions in the netting 
set; 
 
(b)  𝐶 is the haircut value of net collateral held, including both variation margin 
and NICA adjusted by applying the standard supervisory haircuts in Annex 
7J such that the value of non-cash collateral posted by the Reporting Bank 
to its counterparty is increased, and the value of non-cash collateral 
received by the Reporting Bank from its counterparty is decreased;  
 
(c)  𝑇𝐻 is the positive margin threshold where the counterparty would post 
collateral to the Reporting Bank; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-183  
(d)  𝑀𝑇𝐴 is the minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty; and 
 
(e)  𝑁𝐼𝐶𝐴 is the net independent collateral amount. 
 
2.5 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.4 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
calculate the haircut applicable in the calculation of RC using the formula specified in 
paragraph 3.4 of Annex 7J, applying the minimum holding period for the transaction set 
out in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3 of Annex 7J, and using the margin period of risk of the 
transaction as the value for 𝑁𝑅. 
 
 
Section 3: Potential Future Exposure 
 
3.1 
A Reporting Bank must calculate PFE using the following formula: 
 
𝑃𝐹𝐸= 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑟 𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒 
 
where – 
 
(a)  𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒 is the aggregate add-on calculated in accordance with 
paragraph 3.2 of this Annex; and 
 
(b)  𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑟 is calculated using the following formula: 
 
𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑟= 𝑚𝑖𝑛{1; 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟+ (1 −𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟) 𝑒𝑥𝑝(
𝑉−𝐶
2(1 −𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟)𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒)} 
 
where – 
 
(i)  
𝑒𝑥𝑝(… ) is the exponential function; 
 
(ii)  𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟 = 5%; and 
 
(iii)  𝑉 and 𝐶 are calculated as set out in paragraph 2.1 of this Annex for 
unmargined netting sets or paragraph 2.4 of this Annex for margined 
netting sets, whichever is applicable.  
 
 
Aggregate add-on across asset classes 
 
3.2 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the aggregate add-on, 𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒, using 
the following formula: 
 
𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒=
∑
𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠
𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠
 
 
where 𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 is the respective add-on for each asset class calculated 
in accordance with paragraphs 3.13 to 3.24 of this Annex. 
 
3.3  
A Reporting Bank must not recognise diversification benefits across asset 
classes when computing the aggregate add-on.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-184  
 
 
Allocation of transactions to one or more asset classes 
 
3.4 
Subject to paragraph 3.6 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must allocate each 
transaction to one of the 5 asset classes (that is, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, 
equity, commodity) on the basis of the primary risk factor of the transaction, defined by 
the transaction’s underlying instrument344.  
 
3.5 
For more complex transactions that have more than one risk factor 345, a 
Reporting Bank must take sensitivities and volatilities of the underlying instrument into 
account for determining the primary risk factor. 
 
3.6 
The Authority may require a Reporting Bank to allocate more complex 
transactions to more than one asset class, resulting in the same position being included in 
multiple asset classes. Where the Authority requires a Reporting Bank to allocate a 
transaction to more than one asset class, the Reporting Bank must determine 
appropriately the sign and supervisory delta adjustment of the relevant risk factor for each 
asset class to which the transaction is allocated. 
 
 
Hedging sets within each asset class 
 
3.7 
Subject to paragraphs 3.8 to 3.12 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must group 
transactions into hedging sets within each asset class as follows: 
 
(a)  interest rate derivatives into separate hedging sets for each currency; 
 
(b)  foreign exchange derivatives into separate hedging sets for each currency 
pair; 
 
(c)  credit derivatives into a single hedging set; 
 
(d)  equity derivatives into a single hedging set;  
 
(e)  commodity derivatives into 4 separate hedging sets according to the 
following categories of commodity derivatives: 
 
(i)  
energy; 
 
(ii)  metals; 
 
(iii)  agricultural commodities;  
 
(iv)  other commodities. 
 
 
344  
For example, an interest rate curve is the primary risk factor for an interest rate swap, a reference entity 
is the primary risk factor for a credit default swap, and a foreign exchange rate is the primary risk factor 
for a foreign exchange call option. 
345  
For example, multi-asset derivative transactions or hybrid derivative transactions.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-185  
3.8  
A Reporting Bank must group transactions that reference the basis between 2 
risk factors and are denominated in a single currency (that is, basis transactions) into 
separate hedging sets within the corresponding asset class346.  
 
3.9  
A Reporting Bank must have a separate hedging set for each pair of risk factors 
(that is, for each specific basis) and must determine the long and short positions within 
the hedging set with respect to the basis. 
 
3.10 
A Reporting Bank must treat derivative transactions with 2 floating legs that 
are denominated in different currencies, including cross-currency swaps, as non-basis 
foreign exchange transactions, and not as basis transactions.  
 
3.11 
A Reporting Bank must group transactions that reference the volatility of a risk 
factor (that is, volatility transactions 347 ) into separate hedging sets within the 
corresponding asset class. The Reporting Bank must apply the same hedging set 
construction set out in paragraph 3.7 of this Annex to volatility hedging sets348.  
 
3.12  
A Reporting Bank must treat inflation derivative transactions in the same 
manner as interest rate derivative transactions and must allocate inflation derivative 
transactions into separate hedging sets for each currency. To avoid doubt, a Reporting 
Bank must form separate hedging sets for inflation derivative transactions and interest 
rate derivative transactions for the same currency.  
 
 
Add-on for interest rate derivatives 
 
3.13  
A Reporting Bank must allocate the interest rate derivative transactions in each 
hedging set to one of the following 3 maturity buckets based on 𝐸𝑖 of the derivative 
transaction as defined in paragraph 3.28(a)(i) of this Annex:  
 
(a)  Maturity Bucket 1, for transactions of 𝐸𝑖 less than one year; 
 
(b)  Maturity Bucket 2, for transactions of 𝐸𝑖 between one year and 5 years; 
 
(c)  Maturity Bucket 3, for transactions of 𝐸𝑖 greater than 5 years. 
 
3.14 
A 
Reporting 
Bank 
must 
calculate 
the 
add-on 
for 
interest 
rate 
derivatives, 𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝐼𝑅, as the sum of the add-ons for each hedging set of interest rate 
derivatives transacted with a counterparty in a netting set, as follows:

Examples of specific bases include 3-month Libor versus 6-month Libor, 3-month Libor versus 3-month 
T-Bill, one-month Libor versus OIS rate, and Brent Crude oil versus Henry Hub gas. 
347  
Examples of volatility transactions include variance and volatility swaps, and options on realised or implied 
volatility. 
348  
For example, all equity volatility transactions form a single hedging set.

For the calculation of the add-on for commodity derivatives, a Reporting Bank 
may only offset fully long and short positions for commodity derivatives where the long 
and short positions reference the same type of underlying commodity. The Reporting Bank 
may only partially offset commodity derivatives referencing different types of underlying

𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 is the effective notional of each derivative 
transaction in the hedging set. 
 
3.24  
For the purposes of the calculation in paragraph 3.23 of this Annex, a Reporting 
Bank must assess that the commodities referenced by the derivative transactions grouped 
under each commodity type demonstrate stable and meaningful joint dynamics. If the 
commodities referenced by the derivative transactions grouped under each commodity 
type do not demonstrate stable and meaningful joint dynamics, and if the Reporting Bank 
is significantly exposed to the basis risk of different products within the commodity types, 
the Reporting Bank must use more refined definitions of commodity types. 350  The 
Authority may require the Reporting Bank to use more refined definitions of commodity 
types. 
 
 
350  
For example, with regard to characteristics such as location and quality. To illustrate, the energy hedging 
set may contain commodity types such as crude oil, electricity, natural gas and coal. However, crude oil as 
a commodity type within the energy hedging set, could omit a substantial basis risk between different types 
of crude oil products such as West Texas Intermediate, Brent, Saudi Light, etc.

a Reporting Bank must calculate the effective notional of an option in accordance with 
paragraphs 3.26 and 3.27 of this Annex. 
 
3.26  
For the purposes of calculating the effective notional of an option, a Reporting 
Bank must –  
 
(a)  in the case of a single-payment option where the option’s payoff can be 
represented as a payoff of a combination of European option351, treat each 
European option component as a separate transaction; and 
 
(b)  in the case of a multiple-payment option, treat the option as a combination 
of single-payment options352, and for each single-payment option, define 
𝑆𝑖 and 𝑇𝑖 as the time periods starting from the current date to the start of 
the coupon period and 𝐸𝑖 as the time period starting from the current date 
to the end of the coupon period. 
 
3.27  
A Reporting Bank must calculate the effective notional of a bought or sold digital 
option that has strike price equal to 𝐾𝑖 as the lower of –  
 
(a)  the effective notional of a “collar” combination of bought and sold 
European options of the same type (call or put) with the strikes set equal 
to 0.95. 𝐾𝑖 and 1.05. 𝐾𝑖 where –  
 
(i)  
the size of the “collar” components referred to in sub-paragraph (a) 
are such that the payoff of the digital option is reproduced exactly 
outside the region between the 2 strike prices; and 
 
(ii)  the effective notional for the bought and sold European option 
components that make up the “collar” referred to in sub-paragraph 
(a) are calculated separately, and using the exercise date 𝑇𝑖 and the 
current value of the underlying 𝑃𝑖 of the digital option as inputs for 
the calculation of the supervisory delta adjustment in accordance 
with paragraph 3.31 of this Annex; and 
 
(b)  the ratio of the payoff of the digital option to the relevant supervisory 
factor.

3.28  
For the purposes of paragraphs 3.14, 3.16, 3.18, 3.20 and 3.23 of this Annex, 
a Reporting Bank must calculate the trade-level adjusted notional amount for interest rate, 
foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodity derivatives, as follows: 
 
 
351  
Examples include collars, butterfly/calendar spreads, straddles, and strangles. 
352  
For example, a Reporting Bank must treat an interest rate cap or floor as individual caplets or floorlets, 
respectively, each of which is a European option on the floating interest rate over a specific coupon period.

the current reporting date) until the start and end, respectively, of 
the time period referenced by the interest rate or credit derivative, 
as applicable. Where the start date has occurred353, the Reporting 
Bank must set 𝑆𝑖 to zero; and 
 
(ii) 
𝑆𝐷𝑖 is subject to a minimum of 10 business days; 
 
(b)  for foreign exchange derivatives, the trade notional amount of the foreign 
currency leg of the contract converted to the domestic currency of the 
Reporting Bank, or where both legs of a foreign exchange derivative are 
denominated in currencies other than the domestic currency of the 
Reporting Bank, the higher of the trade notional amount of each leg 
converted to the domestic currency of the Reporting Bank;  
 
(c)  for equity and commodity derivatives, the product of the current price of 
one unit of the stock or commodity354 and the number of units referenced 
by the trade. For equity and commodity volatility transactions, the 
Reporting Bank must replace the unit price by the underlying volatility or 
variance referenced by the transaction, and the number of units by the 
contractual notional.  
 
3.29  
For the purposes of determining 𝑆𝑖 and 𝐸𝑖 in paragraph 3.28(a) of this Annex, a 
Reporting Bank must make a distinction between the time period of the underlying 
instrument and the remaining maturity of the derivative transaction. If the derivative 
transaction references the value of another interest rate or credit instrument 355, the 
Reporting Bank must determine 𝑆𝑖 and 𝐸𝑖 on the basis of the underlying instrument356. In 
the case of Bermudan swaptions, the Reporting Bank must set 𝑆𝑖 as the time period 
(starting from the current reporting date) until the earliest contractual exercise date and 
𝐸𝑖 as the time period (starting from the current reporting date) until the end date of the 
underlying swap. 
 
3.30  
For the purposes of calculating the trade-level adjusted notional amount in 
paragraph 3.28 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must use the trade notional amount stated 
in the contract in the case where it is stated clearly and fixed until maturity. Otherwise, 
the Reporting Bank must determine the trade notional amount as follows: 
 
353     For example, an ongoing interest rate swap. 
354  
For example, a share of equity or barrel of oil. 
355  
For example, in the case of swaption or bond option. 
356  
For example, a European interest rate swaption with expiry of one year and the term of the underlying 
swap of 5 years has 𝑆𝑖 = 1 year and 𝐸𝑖 = 6 years. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-194  
 
(a)  for transactions where the notional is a formula of market values, the 
Reporting Bank must calculate the trade notional amount by inputting 
current market values into the formula; 
 
(b)  for all interest rate and credit derivatives with variable notional amounts 
specified in the contract357, the Reporting Bank must calculate the trade 
notional amount as the time-weighted average notional over the 
remaining life of the derivative. To avoid doubt, this treatment does not 
apply to transactions where the trade notional amount varies due to price 
changes358; 
 
(c)  for leveraged swaps, the Reporting Bank must calculate the trade notional 
amount by converting the stated notional amount into the notional amount 
of an equivalent unleveraged swap. Where all rates in a swap are 
multiplied by a factor, the Reporting Bank must calculate the trade 
notional amount as the product of the stated notional amount and the 
factor on the rates;  
 
(d)  for transactions with multiple exchanges of principal, the Reporting Bank 
must calculate the trade notional amount as the product of the stated 
notional amount and the remaining number of exchanges of principal in 
the derivative contract. 
 
 
Supervisory delta adjustment 
 
3.31  
For the purposes of paragraphs 3.14, 3.16, 3.18, 3.20 and 3.23 of this Annex, 
a Reporting Bank must calculate the appropriate supervisory delta adjustment for 
transaction ‘i’, 𝛿𝑖, for interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodity 
derivatives, to reflect its direction and non-linearity (if applicable) as follows: 
 
 
Long in the primary risk 
factor 
Short in the primary 
risk factor 
Instruments that are not 
options or collateralised 
debt obligation (“CDO”) 
tranches, and options or 
CDO tranches that are 
not amenable to be 
treated under the 
formulas for options and 
CDO tranches 
𝛿𝑖= +1 
𝛿𝑖= −1 
where: 
“Long in the primary risk factor” means that the market value of the instrument 
increases when the value of the primary risk factor increases; and 
“Short in the primary risk factor” means that the market value of the instrument 
decreases when the value of the primary risk factor increases. 
 
 
357  
Examples include amortising and accreting swaps. 
358  
Examples include foreign exchange, equity, and commodity derivatives.

the Reporting Bank must determine L, which is the lowest value of 𝑃𝑖 and 𝐾𝑖 
of all interest rate options in currency j; 
(ii)  the Reporting Bank must calculate 𝜆𝑗 for currency j using the formula 𝜆𝑗=
Threshold −L; and

3.32  
For the purposes of the calculation of 𝜆𝑗 in paragraph 3.31, a Reporting Bank 
must update the value of L at least semi-annually. The Reporting Bank must determine 
the parameter L using the lowest value of 𝑃𝑖 and 𝐾𝑖 of all interest rate options in currency 
j at the point of time when performing the update. 
 
3.33 
For the purposes of calculating the supervisory delta adjustment for European, 
Asian, American and Bermudan call and put options, a Reporting Bank must –  
 
 
359  
For example, the spot, forward or average value of the underlying. Where appropriate, the Reporting Bank 
should use the forward value instead of the spot value of the underlying in the supervisory delta adjustment 
formula in order to account for the risk-free rate and for possible cash flows prior to the option expiry such 
as dividends. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-196  
(a)  use the formula for call and put options specified in paragraph 3.31 of this 
Annex. To avoid doubt, for American and Bermudan options, 𝑇𝑖 is the 
period of time (starting from the current reporting date) until the latest 
allowed contractual exercise date of the option; and 
 
(b)  for Asian call and put options, set 𝑃𝑖 referred to in paragraph 3.31 of this 
Annex to the current value of the average used in the payoff. 
 
3.34 
A Reporting Bank must treat an nth-to-default transaction on a pool of m 
reference names as a CDO tranche for the purposes of calculating the supervisory delta 
adjustment for the transaction. The Reporting Bank must use an attachment point of A=(n-
1)/m and a detachment point of D=n/m to calculate the supervisory delta adjustment for 
the transaction in accordance with the formula applicable to CDO tranches in paragraph 
3.31 of this Annex.

Time risk horizon 
 
3.36 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the appropriate maturity factor for transaction 
‘i’, 𝑀𝐹𝑖
𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒, reflecting the time risk horizon appropriate for the type of transaction (that is, 
unmargined or margined), as follows: 
 
(a)  for unmargined transactions, using the following formula: 
 
𝑀𝐹𝑖
𝑢𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑= √min {𝑀𝑖; 1 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟}
1 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟
 
 
where 𝑀𝑖 (expressed in years) is the remaining maturity of transaction 
‘i’360, and is based on the time period (starting from the current reporting 
date) until the latest date when the transaction may still be active, and 𝑀𝑖 
is subject to a minimum of 10 business days; 
 
(b)  for margined transactions, using the following formula: 
 
 
360  
For example, for a one-month option on a 10-year Treasury bond, 𝑀𝑖 of the transaction is one month, (i.e. 
the one-month to expiration date of the derivative contract), and 𝐸𝑖 of the transaction is based on the 10-
year remaining maturity on the Treasury bond, and is 10 years. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-197  
𝑀𝐹𝑖
𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑= 3
2 √𝑀𝑃𝑂𝑅𝑖 
1 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 
 
where 𝑀𝑃𝑂𝑅𝑖 is the margin period of risk appropriate for the margin 
agreement containing transaction ‘i’, and 𝑀𝑃𝑂𝑅𝑖 is subject to the 
minimum margin period of risk that applies under paragraph 6.2 of Annex 
7E or paragraph 7.7.34, whichever is applicable. 
 
3.37 
For the purposes of the calculation of the maturity factor for a transaction 
pursuant to paragraph 3.36(a) or (b) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must use standard 
market convention to convert business days into years, and vice versa.361  
 
3.38 
If a derivative transaction has another derivative transaction as its underlying362 
and may be physically exercised into the underlying derivative transaction (that is, a 
position in the underlying derivative transaction would be assumed by the Reporting Bank 
upon exercise), a Reporting Bank must set 𝑀𝑖 referred to in paragraph 3.36(a) of this 
Annex as the time period (starting today) until final settlement date of the underlying 
derivative transaction.  
 
3.39 
For a transaction that is structured to settle outstanding exposures on specified 
payment dates and where the terms are reset such that the fair value of the contract is 
zero on these specified dates, a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a)  treat the transaction as an unmargined transaction;  
 
(b)  set 𝑀𝑖 referred to in paragraph 3.36(a) of this Annex to be equal to the 
time until the next reset date; and  
 
(c)  subject 𝑀𝑖 to a minimum of 10 business days.  
 
 
Supervisory parameters 
 
3.40 
Table 7D-1 and paragraph 3.41 of this Annex set out the supervisory 
parameters for the supervisory factor, correlation factor and supervisory option volatility.  
 
3.41 
For the purposes of paragraphs 3.14, 3.16, 3.18, 3.20 and 3.23 of this Annex, 
a Reporting Bank must apply the appropriate supervisory factor in Table 7D-1, except in 
either of the following cases:  
 
 
361  
For example –  
(a)  for unmargined transactions, the maturity parameter (𝑀𝑖) referred to in paragraph 3.36(a) of this 
Annex is expressed in years but is subject to a floor of 10 business days. A Reporting Bank should 
calculate the floor for 𝑀𝑖 as 10/250 years, where a year is represented by 250 business days; and 
(b)  for margined transactions, the margin period of risk (𝑀𝑃𝑂𝑅𝑖) is often expressed in days, but the 
calculation of the maturity factor for margined netting sets as referred to in paragraph 3.36(b) of this 
Annex references one year in the denominator. When calculating the maturity factor in paragraph 
3.36(b) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank may represent the denominator as 250 business days; or 
alternatively, represent 𝑀𝑃𝑂𝑅𝑖 expressed in business days in the numerator in years by dividing it by 
250. 
362  
For example, swaptions. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-198  
(a)  a hedging set consisting of basis transactions, in which case the Reporting 
Bank must adjust the appropriate supervisory factor in Table 7D-1 by 
multiplying it by a factor of 0.5;  
 
(b)  a hedging set consisting of volatility transactions, in which case the 
Reporting Bank must adjust the appropriate supervisory factor in Table 
7D-1 by multiplying it by a factor of 5. 
 
3.42 
For determining the supervisory factor for the credit asset class in Table 7D-1, 
a Reporting Bank must assign a reference entity a credit quality grade based on the 
external credit assessment that is applicable to the reference entity in accordance with 
Table 7M-1. For a reference entity which does not have an external credit assessment by 
a recognised ECAI, the Reporting Bank must map the internal rating under the IRBA, of 
the reference entity to the appropriate credit quality grade, if the Reporting Bank has 
received approval from the Authority to adopt the IRBA pursuant to Division 4 of Part VII. 
In all other cases, the Reporting Bank must apply a supervisory factor of 1.06%.  
 
3.43 
For the purposes of paragraphs 3.14, 3.16, 3.18, 3.20, 3.23 and 3.31 of this 
Annex, a Reporting Bank must not make any modelling assumptions in the calculation of 
the add-on for each asset class and must use the supervisory parameters set out in Table 
7D-1 and paragraph 3.41 of this Annex.

Section 4: Treatment of Multiple Margin Agreements and Multiple Netting Sets 
 
4.1 
In the case where multiple margin agreements apply to a single netting set, a 
Reporting Bank must divide the netting set into sub-netting sets that align with their 
respective margin agreements. The Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a)  calculate the RC for the entire netting set in accordance with paragraph 
2.4 of this Annex where – 
 
(i)  
𝑉 is the current market value of all margined and unmargined 
derivative transactions in the netting set; 
 
(ii)  𝐶 is the haircut value of net collateral (including both variation 
margin and NICA) held by the Reporting Bank for all derivative 
transactions in the netting set, adjusted by applying the standard 
supervisory haircuts in Annex 7J for the margin period of risk of the 
transactions, such that the value of non-cash collateral posted by the 
Reporting Bank to its counterparty is increased, and the value of 
non-cash collateral received by the Reporting Bank from its 
counterparty is decreased;  
 
(iii)  𝑇𝐻 is the sum of the counterparty thresholds across all variation 
margin agreements within the netting set; and 
 
(iv)  𝑀𝑇𝐴 is the sum of the minimum transfer amounts across all 
variation margin agreements within the netting set; and 
 
(b)  calculate the PFE of the entire netting set as the product of the aggregate 
add-on and the multiplier where –  
 
(i)  
the multiplier is calculated in accordance with paragraph 3.1(b) of 
this Annex, with the inputs 𝑉 and 𝐶 calculated in accordance with 
sub-paragraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii); and  
 
(ii)  the aggregate add-on is calculated as the sum of the aggregated 
add-ons for each sub-netting set where –   
 
(A)  all unmargined transactions within the netting set form a single 
sub-netting set; and 
 
(B)  all margined transactions within the netting set that share the 
same 𝑀𝑃𝑂𝑅 form a single sub-netting set.  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-201  
4.2 
In the case where a single margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets, 
a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a)  calculate the replacement cost for the entire margin agreement, 𝑅𝐶𝑀𝐴, as 
follows364: 
 
𝑅𝐶𝑀𝐴= 𝑚𝑎𝑥{ ∑𝑚𝑎𝑥{𝑉𝑁𝑆;0}
𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴
−𝑚𝑎𝑥{𝐶𝑀𝐴; 0};0}
+ 𝑚𝑎𝑥{ ∑𝑚𝑖𝑛{𝑉𝑁𝑆;0}
𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴
−𝑚𝑖𝑛{𝐶𝑀𝐴;0}; 0} 
 
where the summation NS ∈MA is across the netting sets covered by the 
margin agreement, VNS is the current mark-to-market value of netting set 
‘NS’ and CMA is the haircut value of net collateral (including both variation 
margin and NICA) held under the margin agreement ‘MA’, adjusted by 
applying the standard supervisory haircuts in Annex 7J for the margin 
period of risk of the transactions, such that the value of non-cash collateral 
posted by the Reporting Bank to its counterparty is increased, and the 
value of non-cash collateral received by the Reporting Bank from its 
counterparty is decreased; 
 
(b)  allocate the available collateral C to the netting sets, for the calculation of 
the multiplier, as follows: 
 
(i)  
if the Reporting Bank is a net receiver of collateral (C>0), all 
individual collateral amounts that are allocated to the individual 
netting sets must be positive or zero. The Reporting Bank must first 
allocate to netting sets with positive market values, collaterals up to 
the amount of the market values of the respective netting sets. The 
Reporting Bank may attribute surplus collateral freely among all 
other netting sets only after all the netting sets with positive market 
values have been compensated; 
 
(ii)  if the Reporting Bank is a net provider of collateral (C<0), all 
individual collateral amounts that are allocated to the individual 
netting sets must be negative or zero. The Reporting Bank must first 
allocate to netting sets with negative market values, collaterals up 
to the amount of the market values of the respective netting sets. If 
the collateral provided is larger than the sum of the negative market 
values of the netting sets, the Reporting Bank must set all multipliers 
to one;  
 
 
364  
The first term is equal to the unmargined current exposure of the Reporting Bank to the counterparty 
aggregated across all netting sets under the margin agreement reduced by the positive current net 
collateral (that is, collateral is subtracted only when the Reporting Bank is a net holder of collateral). The 
second term is equal to the current net posted collateral (if any) reduced by the unmargined current 
exposure of the counterparty to the Reporting Bank aggregated across all netting sets under the margin 
agreement (that is, it is non-zero only when the Reporting Bank is a net poster of collateral). 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-202  
(iii)  the Reporting Bank must ensure that the allocated collaterals add up 
to the total amount of collaterals available for the margin agreement; 
and 
 
(c) 
calculate the amount for potential future exposure for the entire margin 
agreement, 𝑃𝐹𝐸𝑀𝐴, as the sum of netting set-level PFEs calculated using 
the formulas for unmargined transactions, as follows: 
 
𝑃𝐹𝐸𝑀𝐴=
∑𝑃𝐹𝐸𝑁𝑆
𝑢𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑
𝑁𝑆∈𝑀𝐴
 
 
where 𝑃𝐹𝐸𝑁𝑆
(𝑢𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑) is the PFE for netting set ‘NS’ calculated using the 
formulas for unmargined transactions. 
 
 
Section 5: Treatment of collateral taken outside of netting sets 
 
5.1 
A Reporting Bank must treat eligible collateral, which is taken outside a netting 
set that is unmargined but is available to the Reporting Bank to offset losses due to 
counterparty default on one netting set only, as an independent collateral amount 
associated with the netting set and used within the calculation of the RC in accordance 
with paragraph 2.1 of this Annex. 
 
5.2 
A Reporting Bank must treat eligible collateral, which is taken outside a netting 
set that is margined but is available to the Reporting Bank to offset losses due to 
counterparty default on one netting set only, as an independent collateral amount 
associated with the netting set and used within the calculation of the RC in accordance 
with paragraph 2.4 of this Annex. 
 
5.3 
A Reporting Bank must treat eligible collateral, which is taken outside a netting 
set but is available to the Reporting Bank to offset losses due to counterparty default on 
more than one netting set, as collateral taken under a margin agreement applicable to 
multiple netting sets and calculate RC and PFE in accordance with paragraph 4.2 of this 
Annex. 
 
5.4 
In cases where the eligible collateral is available to offset losses on non-
derivative as well as exposures determined using the SA-CCR, a Reporting Bank must use 
only the portion of the collateral assigned to the derivatives to reduce the derivatives 
exposure.

Annex 7E 
CCR INTERNAL MODELS METHOD 
 
 
Section 1:  Application to Adopt CCR Internal Models Method 
 
1.1 
 
A Reporting Bank must apply in writing for approval from the Authority if it 
intends to adopt the CCR internal models method.  
 
1.2 
 
The Authority may grant approval for a Reporting Bank to adopt the CCR 
internal models method subject to such conditions or restrictions as the Authority may 
impose.365 The Authority may require a period of initial monitoring and live testing of the 
Reporting Bank’s models under the CCR internal models method before approving the 
Reporting Bank’s adoption of the CCR internal models method for regulatory capital 
purposes. 
 
1.3 
 
Subject to paragraph 1.2 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank may use the CCR 
internal models method to calculate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for the pre-
settlement counterparty exposure in any of the following transaction types: 
 
(a)  any OTC derivative transaction;  
 
(b)   any exchange-traded derivative transaction; 
 
(c)  any long settlement transaction;  
 
(d)  any SFT. 
 
1.4 
A Reporting Bank which has received approval to adopt the CCR internal models 
method for a particular transaction type must apply the method to all relevant exposures 
within that transaction type, except those that are immaterial in size and risk or unless a 
phased rollout is permitted by the Authority.

A Reporting Bank must not adopt the CCR internal models method to a centrally 
cleared version of a transaction type for which the Reporting Bank had received approval 
for application of the CCR internal models method, without prior approval from the 
Authority. 
 
1.6 
Despite paragraph 1.4 of this Annex, the Authority may allow a phased rollout 
of the CCR internal models method within a particular transaction type in the initial 
implementation phase and allow a Reporting Bank to use the SA-CCR for a portion of its 
business in the initial implementation phase. The Reporting Bank must submit a plan to 
the Authority to bring all material exposures within the transaction type under the CCR 
internal models method. 
 
1.7 
 
A Reporting Bank which has adopted the CCR internal models approach must 
continue to adopt the CCR internal models method. The Reporting Bank must not revert 
 
365  
Factors considered in the Authority’s assessment include the characteristics of the Reporting Bank’s 
portfolio of exposures that give rise to CCR, in particular, the diversification and number of risk factors the 
portfolio is exposed to, the correlation of default across counterparties, and the number and granularity of 
counterparties. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-204  
to using the SA-CCR to calculate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for all or part of its 
exposures, unless permitted by the Authority, and such permission shall be given only in 
exceptional circumstances or for immaterial exposures. The Authority will not normally 
grant such approval unless the Reporting Bank is able to demonstrate good cause for the 
change and that such change is not intended to avoid or reduce regulatory capital which 
the Reporting Bank would otherwise be required to maintain.  
 
1.8 
 
The model used by a Reporting Bank within its CCR internal models method 
may be a simulation model, an analytical model or other forms of model. A Reporting Bank 
which intends to adopt a model that is not a simulation model must be able to demonstrate 
to the satisfaction of the Authority, that such a model meets all relevant requirements in 
this Annex. 
 
1.9 
 
If a Reporting Bank becomes aware that it does not comply with all the 
requirements in this Annex or the conditions or restrictions imposed by the Authority 
pursuant to paragraph 1.2 of this Annex, it must – 
 
(a)  inform the Authority in writing as soon as practicable and, in any case, no 
later than 5 business days of the Reporting Bank becoming aware, of the 
failure to meet any requirement, or any non-compliance with the 
conditions or restrictions, as the case may be; 
 
(b)  assess the effect of the failure to meet the requirement(s), or non-
compliance with the conditions or restrictions, as the case may be, in 
terms of the risk(s) posed to the Reporting Bank (if any); 
 
(c)  prepare a plan to rectify the issues that led to the failure to meet the 
requirement(s) or non-compliance with the conditions or restrictions, as 
the case may be, and inform the Authority of its plan (including its target 
completion date for the plan) as soon as practicable; and 
 
(d)  undertake prompt corrective action in accordance with the plan prepared 
pursuant to sub-paragraph (c). 
 
1.10 
 
If a Reporting Bank fails to comply with paragraph 1.9 of this Annex or if the 
Authority is of the view that a Reporting Bank’s estimates of E or EAD, whichever is 
applicable, or estimates of alpha, under the CCR internal models method does not 
adequately reflect its CCR exposures, the Authority shall take appropriate actions, which 
may include revoking its approval for the Reporting Bank to adopt the CCR internal models 
method. The Reporting Bank may also be required to revise its estimates or apply a higher 
estimate of E or EAD, whichever is applicable, or a higher estimate of alpha for the 
purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements.  
 
 
Section 2:  Exposure Measurement 
 
2.1 
 
Under the CCR internal models method, a Reporting Bank must calculate E or 
EAD, whichever is applicable, at the level of the netting set.  
 
2.2 
 
A Reporting Bank must have internal procedures in place to verify that, prior to 
including a transaction in a netting set, the transaction is covered by a qualifying bilateral 
netting agreement or a qualifying cross-product netting agreement. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-205  
 
2.3 
 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its model under the CCR internal models 
method specifies the forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting 
set attributable to changes in market variables366 so that the Reporting Bank can compute 
E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for the netting set at each future date given the changes 
in the market variables. 
 
2.4 
 
A Reporting Bank which has taken eligible financial collateral for any CCR 
exposure may recognise the effects of CRM of such collateral in accordance with 
paragraphs 2.5 to 2.7 of this Annex, subject to paragraphs 8.30 and 8.31 of this Annex. 
A Reporting Bank which recognises the effects of CRM of collateral must have internal 
procedures to verify that, prior to recognising the effects of CRM of collateral, the 
requirements in Annex 7H are met. 
 
2.5 
 
A Reporting Bank may include eligible financial collateral in its forecasting 
distributions for changes in the fair value of the netting set, provided the quantitative, 
qualitative and data requirements set out in sections for the use of the CCR internal models 
method are met for the collateral. A Reporting Bank which recognises the effects of CRM 
of collateral must have internal procedures to verify that, prior to recognising the effects 
of CRM of collateral, the requirements in Annex 7H are met.  
 
2.6 
 
For margined counterparties, a Reporting Bank may capture future collateral 
movements in its model. 
 
2.7 
 
If a Reporting Bank has recognised the effects of CRM of eligible financial 
collateral in E or EAD, whichever is applicable, through the CCR internal models method, 
it must not take into account the effects of CRM of such eligible financial collateral when 
deriving estimates of LGD. In such instances, the Reporting Bank must use the LGD of an 
otherwise similar uncollateralised facility (i.e. the Reporting Bank must use an LGD that 
does not include collateral that is already included in EAD). 
 
2.8 
 
A Reporting Bank which has not recognised the effect of eligible financial 
collateral through the CCR internal models method may do so by applying the relevant 
rules on the treatment of collateral under the FC(CA). 
 
2.9 
 
A Reporting Bank must calculate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, as follows 
(except for counterparties that have been identified as having explicit specific wrong-way 
risk, where the Reporting Bank must compute E or EAD, whichever is applicable, in 
accordance with paragraphs 8.23 to 8.25 of this Annex): 
 
E or EAD =  𝛼 ×  effective EPE 
 
where 𝛼 is set at 1.4, or any higher amount specified by the Authority367, and 
effective EPE is determined in accordance with Section 3 of this Annex. 
 
 
366  
Examples include interest rates and foreign exchange rates.  
367 
In requiring a higher 𝛼 to be applied, the Authority will consider factors such as the extent to which a 
Reporting Bank meets the model validation requirements in Section 7 of this Annex, the granularity of 
counterparties, exposures to general wrong-way risk, correlation of market values across counterparties 
and other factors specific to the CCR exposures of the Reporting Bank. The Authority will consider a 
Reporting Bank to be eligible for an 𝛼 of 1.4 only if the Reporting Bank fully complies with the model 
validation requirements in Section 7 of this Annex.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-206  
2.10 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the effective EPE based on current market data 
and the effective EPE based on a stress calibration368, in accordance with Section 3 of this 
Annex. A Reporting Bank must apply the effective EPE which will result in a higher 
portfolio-level credit RWA (not including the CVA RWA) for exposures calculated using the 
CCR internal models method, by using the greater of effective EPE based on current market 
data and the effective EPE based on a stress calibration, determined on a total portfolio 
level, instead of on a counterparty by counterparty basis.  
 
2.11 
 
Despite paragraphs 2.9 and 2.10 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank may use a 
measure that is more conservative than effective EPE to estimate E or EAD, whichever is 
applicable, for each counterparty, subject to the approval of the Authority. These measures 
include the use of peak exposure, the use of an EPE model as set out in Section 4 of this 
Annex or the use of VaR models as set out in Annex 7F.  
 
 
Section 3:  Effective EPE 
 
3.1  
 
A Reporting Bank must compute effective EPE by estimating expected exposure 
(EEt)369 as the average exposure at future date t, where the average is taken across 
possible future values of relevant market risk factors370. The model estimates EE at a 
series of future dates t1, t2, t3 and so on. 
 
3.2   
A Reporting Bank must compute effective EE recursively as – 
 
Effective EE𝑡𝑘= max{Effective EE𝑡𝑘−1, 𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑘} 
 
where the current date is denoted as 𝑡0  and Effective EE𝑡0  equals current 
exposure. 
 
3.3 
A Reporting Bank must compute effective EPE as a weighted average of 
effective EE as follows: 
 
Effective EPE =
∑
Effective EE𝑡𝑘× ∆𝑡𝑘
min(1 year,   maturity)
𝑘=1
 
 
where ∆𝑡𝑘= 𝑡𝑘−𝑡𝑘−1. 
 
 
Section 4:  Own estimates for 𝜶 
 
4.1 
 
A Reporting Bank may seek approval from the Authority in its application to 
adopt the CCR internal models method, to compute internal estimates of 𝛼371, subject to 
 
368 
The Reporting Bank should use a single consistent stress calibration for the whole portfolio of counterparties.  
369  
A Reporting Bank should calculate EE or any peak exposure measures based on a distribution of exposures 
that accounts for the possible non-normality of the distribution of exposures, including the existence of 
leptokurtosis, where appropriate.  
370  
Examples include interest rates and foreign exchange rates. 
371  
Where appropriate, a Reporting Bank should condition volatilities and correlations of market risk factors 
used in the joint simulation of market and credit risk on the credit risk factor to reflect potential increases 
in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn. The Reporting Bank should also take into account the 
granularity of exposures in its internal estimates of 𝛼.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-207  
a floor of 1.2, where 𝛼 equals the ratio of economic capital from a full simulation of 
counterparty exposures across counterparties (numerator) and economic capital based on 
EPE (denominator). 
 
4.2 
 
A Reporting Bank must meet all the requirements in Sections 7 and 8 of this 
Annex and must be able to demonstrate that its internal estimates of 𝛼 capture in the 
numerator the material sources of stochastic dependency of distributions of fair values of 
transactions or of portfolios of transactions across counterparties372. In the denominator, 
the Reporting Bank must use EPE as if it were a fixed outstanding loan amount. 
 
4.3 
 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the numerator and denominator of α are 
computed in a consistent fashion with respect to the modeling methodology, parameter 
specifications and portfolio composition. The Reporting Bank must use an approach that is 
based on the internal economic capital approach of the Reporting Bank. The Reporting 
Bank must ensure that the approach is well-documented and subject to independent 
validation. In addition, the Reporting Bank must review its estimates on at least a quarterly 
basis, and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time. The 
Reporting Bank must also assess the model risk, including an assessment of potential 
significant variations in estimates of alpha that arise from the possibility of mis-
specification in the models used for the numerator, especially where convexity is present. 
 
 
Section 5:  Maturity Adjustment  
 
5.1 
 
A Reporting Bank must apply the formula in Section 3 of Annex 7V to calculate 
M for netting sets in which the original maturity of the longest-dated contract within the 
set is greater than one year. 
 
5.2 
 
Despite paragraph 5.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank which uses an internal 
model to calculate a one-sided CVA may seek approval in its application to adopt the CCR 
internal models method, to use the effective credit duration estimated by the model as M. 
 
5.3 
 
A Reporting Bank must apply the formula in Section 1 or 2 of Annex 7V for M 
for netting sets in which all contracts have an original maturity of less than one year, with 
the exception of short-term exposures listed in paragraph 4.2 of Annex 7V, in which case 
the Reporting Bank must apply calculate M in accordance with paragraph 4.1 or 4.5 of 
Annex 7V. 
 
 
Section 6:  Margin Agreements 
 
6.1 
 
Where a netting set is subject to a margin agreement and the Reporting Bank 
is able to capture the effects of margining when estimating EE, the model’s EE measure 
may be used directly in the equation in paragraph 3.2 of this Annex, provided that approval 
from the Authority has been obtained for this purpose. The Reporting Bank must ensure 
that the EPE model also includes transaction-specific information in order to capture the 
effects of margining, and takes into account both the current amount of margin and margin 
that would be passed between counterparties in the future. The Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the EPE model accounts for the nature of margin agreements (unilateral or 
bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the margin period of risk, the thresholds of 
 
372  
For example, the correlation of defaults across counterparties and between market risk and default. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-208  
unmargined exposure the Reporting Bank is willing to accept, and the minimum transfer 
amount. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the EPE model either models the mark-to-
market change in the value of collateral posted or applies the relevant rules on the 
treatment of collateral under the FC(CA). 
 
6.2  
For modeling EAD with margin agreements, a Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a)  for transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark-to-market 
valuation – 
 
(i)  
apply a floor on the margin period of risk of each netting set in 
accordance with the following table: 
 
Table 7E-1 – Floors on Margin Period of Risk for Netting Sets 
Type of netting set 
Floor (in business 
days) 
Netting set consisting only of repo-style 
transactions 
5 
Netting set where the number of transactions  
exceeds 5,000 at any point during a quarter 
20 (for the following 
quarter) 
Netting 
set 
containing 
one 
or 
more 
transactions involving either illiquid collateral 
or an OTC derivative transaction that cannot 
be easily replaced, determined in the context 
of stressed market conditions373. This does not 
apply in the case of any transitional illiquidity 
of collateral and OTC derivative transactions 
that reference a new benchmark rate, for up 
to one year after the discontinuation of an old 
benchmark rate. 
 
Stressed market conditions are characterised 
by the absence of continuously active markets 
where a counterparty would, within 2 or fewer 
business days, obtain multiple price quotations 
that would not move the market or represent 
a price reflecting a market discount (in the 
case of collateral) or premium (in the case of 
an OTC derivative transaction). 
20 
All other netting sets 
10 
 
(ii)  in relation to any quarter (“relevant quarter”), use a margin period 
of risk that appropriately reflects the duration of margin call disputes 
over 2 quarters immediately preceding the relevant quarter, and 
which is at least double the floor set out in Table 7E-1 for the relevant 
quarter and the next quarter after the relevant quarter for a netting 
set where there are more than 2 margin call disputes over the 2 
 
373  
Examples of situations where transactions are deemed illiquid for this purpose include, but are not limited 
to, transactions that are not marked daily, and transactions that are subject to specific accounting 
treatment for valuation purposes (e.g. transactions referencing securities whose fair value is determined 
by models with inputs that are not observed in the market). 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-209  
quarters immediately preceding the relevant quarter that have lasted 
longer than the applicable floors set out in Table 7E-1;  
 
(iii) count every instance of a margin call being disputed, regardless of 
the size of the margin call disputed; and 
 
(iv)  consider whether transactions or securities it holds as collateral are 
concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that counterparty 
exited the market precipitously, whether the Reporting Bank would 
be able to replace its transactions; and 
 
(b)  for transactions subject to re-margining with a periodicity of N-days, use 
a margin period of risk at least equal to the floor plus N days minus one 
day: 
 
Margin period of risk = F + N -1 
 
where –  
 
(i)  
F is the floor; and 
 
(ii)  N is the periodicity. 
 
6.3 
For the purposes of paragraph 6.2 of this Annex, in the case of non-centrally 
cleared derivative transactions that are subject to the Guidelines on Margin Requirements 
for Non-Centrally Cleared OTC Derivatives Contracts [SFA 15-G03], a Reporting Bank, 
when determining the margin period of risk in accordance with paragraph 6.2(a)(ii) of this 
Annex or counting instances where margin calls are disputed in accordance with paragraph 
6.2(a)(iii) of this Annex, must include only variation margin call disputes. 
 
6.4 
A Reporting Bank using the internal models method must not capture the effect 
of a reduction of E or EAD, whichever is applicable, due to any clause in a collateral 
agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. 
 
 
Section 7:  Model Validation Requirements 
 
7.1 
 
A Reporting Bank intending to adopt an internal model for estimating EPE 
arising from CCR for regulatory capital purposes must –  
 
(a)  conduct a regular programme of backtesting, i.e. an ex-post comparison 
of the risk measures generated by the model against realised risk 
measures, as well as a comparison of hypothetical changes based on static 
positions with realised measures; 
 
(b)  carry out an initial validation and an ongoing periodic review, independent 
of the model developers, of its model and risk measures generated by the 
model; 
 
(c)  closely integrate its internal risk measurement exposure model into its 
day-to-day risk management process, where the model output forms an 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-210  
integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and controlling the 
counterparty credit risk profile of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(d)  use its risk measurement system in conjunction with internal trading and 
exposure limits, where exposure limits must be related to the risk 
measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and that is 
well understood by traders, the credit function and senior management; 
 
(e)  have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a well-documented 
set of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning the operation 
of the risk measurement system, and have a well-documented risk 
measurement system374; 
 
(f)  
carry out an independent review of the risk measurement system and of 
the overall risk management process regularly as part of the internal audit 
process, including both the activities of the business trading units and of 
the independent risk control unit. The review of the overall risk 
management process375 must at least address the –  
 
(i) 
adequacy of the documentation of the risk management system and 
process; 
 
(ii) 
organisation of the risk control unit; 
 
(iii) integration of CCR measures into daily risk management; 
 
(iv) approval process for models used in the calculation of CCR used by 
front office and back office personnel; 
 
(v) 
validation of any significant change in the risk measurement process; 
 
(vi) scope of CCR captured by the risk measurement model; 
 
(vii) integrity of the management information system; 
 
(viii) accuracy and completeness of position data; 
 
(ix) verification of the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data 
sources used to run internal models, including the independence of 
such data sources; 
 
(x) 
accuracy 
and 
appropriateness 
of 
volatility 
and 
correlation 
assumptions; 
 
(xi) accuracy of valuation and risk transformation calculations; and 
 
 
374  
For example, through a risk management manual that describes the basic principles of the risk management 
system and that provides an explanation of the empirical techniques used to measure counterparty credit 
risk. 
375  
A Reporting Bank should review the overall risk management process at least once a year. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-211  
(xii) verification of model accuracy as described in sub-paragraphs (g) to 
(k);  
 
(g)  document – 
 
(i) 
the process for initial and ongoing validation of its model to a level 
of detail that would enable a third party to recreate the analysis; 
 
(ii) 
the calculation of risk measures generated by the models to a level 
of detail that would enable a third party to recreate the risk measures; 
 
(iii) the frequency with which backtesting analysis and any other ongoing 
validation will be conducted; 
 
(iv) how the validation is conducted with respect to data flows and 
portfolios; and 
 
(v) 
the analyses that are used; 
 
(h)  define and document in a written policy, criteria with which to assess its 
EPE models and the models that input into the calculation of EPE, and have 
in the written policy, a description of the process by which unacceptable 
performance shall be determined and remedied; 
 
(i)  
define how representative counterparty portfolios are constructed for the 
purposes of validating an EPE model and its risk measures; 
 
(j)  
assess more than a single statistic of the model distribution, when 
validating EPE models and its risk measures that produce forecast 
distributions; and 
 
(k)  meet all of the following requirements as part of the initial and ongoing 
validation of its models and its risk measures: 
 
(i) 
carry out backtesting using historical data on movements in market 
risk factors prior to supervisory approval; 
 
(ii) 
in the backtesting process, consider a number of distinct prediction 
time horizons out to at least one year, over a range of various start 
dates and covering a wide range of market conditions; 
 
(iii) backtest the performance of its EPE model and the relevant risk 
measures, as well as the market risk factor predictions that support 
EPE; 
 
(iv) include, in the backtest for collateralised trades, prediction time 
horizons that reflect typical margin periods of risk applied in 
collateralised/margined trading, and long time horizons of at least 
one year; 
 
(v) 
test the pricing models used to calculate CCR exposure for a given 
scenario of future shocks to market risk factors; 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-212  
 
(vi) capture transaction specific information within the EPE model to 
aggregate exposures at the level of the netting set and verify that 
transactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the 
model; 
 
(vii) include static, historical backtesting at regular intervals on 
representative counterparty portfolios, chosen based on their 
sensitivity to the material risk factors and correlations to which the 
Reporting Bank is exposed; 
 
(viii) conduct backtesting that is designed to test the key assumptions of 
the EPE model and the relevant risk measures376; 
 
(ix) correct any significant differences between realised exposures and 
the forecast distribution that are indicative of problems with the 
model or the underlying data; 
 
(x) 
subject the performance of EPE models and its risk measures to a 
backtesting programme that is capable of identifying poor 
performance in the risk measures of an EPE model; 
 
(xi) validate its EPE models and all relevant risk measures out to time 
horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades for which 
exposure is calculated using the CCR internal models method; 
 
(xii) regularly test the pricing models used to calculate counterparty 
exposure against appropriate independent benchmarks as part of the 
ongoing model validation process; 
 
(xiii) include an assessment of recent performance in the ongoing 
validation of its EPE models and the relevant risk measures; 
 
(xiv) assess the frequency with which parameters of an EPE model are 
updated; 
 
(xv) cover all counterparties for which the models are used, in the 
ongoing assessment of model performance;

measure that is more conservative than alpha times effective EPE to 
estimate E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for each counterparty, 
regularly 
validate 
the 
conservatism 
of 
this 
measure, 
and 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority the degree of relative 
conservatism of the measure upon initial supervisory approval and 
at the supervisory reviews of the EPE models. 
 
376  
For example, the modelled relationship between tenors of the same risk factor, or the modelled 
relationships between risk factors. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-213  
 
7.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.1 of this Annex, risk measures refer not only 
to effective EPE, but also to the other risk measures used in the calculation of effective 
EPE including the exposure distribution at a series of future dates, the positive exposure 
distribution at a series of future dates, the market risk factors used to derive the exposures 
and the values of the constituent trades of a portfolio. 
 
7.3 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.1(k)(v) of this Annex, the pricing models may 
be different from those used by the Reporting Bank to calculate market risk over a short 
horizon. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the pricing models for options account for 
the nonlinearity of option value with respect to market risk factors. 
 
7.4 
For the purposes of paragraph 7.1(k)(ix) of this Annex, the Authority may, 
among other things, require additional capital to be held under such circumstances as the 
Authority may determine, while the problems mentioned in paragraph 7.1(k)(ix) of this 
Annex are being solved. 
 
7.5 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and senior management are 
actively involved in the risk control process and that sufficient resources are devoted to 
the credit and counterparty credit risk control function.  
 
7.6 
A Reporting Bank must ensure a level of management with sufficient seniority 
and authority to –  
 
(a)  enforce both reduction of positions taken by individual traders and 
reductions in the Reporting Bank’s overall risk exposure; 
 
(b)  review the daily reports prepared by the independent risk control unit; 
and 
 
(c)  periodically review the ongoing validation of models and backtesting and 
decide the course of action that will be taken to address model weaknesses. 
 
 
Section 8:  Operational Requirements 
 
8.1 
 
A Reporting Bank intending to adopt an internal model for estimating EPE 
arising from CCR for regulatory capital purposes must meet the operational requirements 
set out in paragraphs 8.2 to 8.33 of this Annex. 
 
 
Qualifying Standards on CCR Management 
 
8.2 
 
A Reporting Bank must adhere to sound practices for the management of CCR, 
including those set out in Annex 10A. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-214  
8.3 
 
At a minimum, the Reporting Bank must have a control unit 377  which is 
adequately staffed, independent from the business and trading functions and reports 
directly to senior management, responsible for all of the following: 
 
(a)  the design and implementation of the CCR management framework of the 
Reporting Bank, including the initial and ongoing validation of the CCR 
internal model; 
 
(b)  the integrity of the input data;  
 
(c)  the generation of daily reports and analysis of the output of the Reporting 
Bank’s CCR internal model, including an evaluation of the relationship 
between measures of E or EAD, whichever is applicable, and credit and 
trading limits. 
 
8.4 
A Reporting Bank using the CCR internal models method must have a collateral 
management unit which is responsible for all of the following: 
 
(a)  the calculation and making of margin calls; 
 
(b)  the management of margin call disputes; 
 
(c)  the generation of accurate daily reports on levels of independent amounts, 
initial margins and variation margins; 
 
(d)  the control of the integrity of the data used to make margin calls, ensuring 
that it is consistent and reconciled regularly with all relevant sources of 
data within the Reporting Bank; 
 
(e)  the tracking of the extent of reuse of collateral, both cash and non-cash, 
and the rights that the Reporting Bank gives away to its respective 
counterparties for the collateral that it posts; 
 
(f)  the tracking of concentration to individual collateral asset classes accepted 
by the Reporting Bank; 
 
(g)  the generation of reports which indicate the categories of collateral assets 
that are reused, and the terms of such reuse including instrument, credit 
quality and maturity;  
 
(h)  the production and maintenance of appropriate collateral management 
information that is reported on a regular basis to senior management, 
including information on the type of collateral (both cash and non-cash) 
received and posted, the size, aging and cause for margin call disputes, 
and trends in these figures. 
 
 
377  
A Reporting Bank should ensure that the work of the control unit responsible for the design and 
implementation of the CCR management framework is closely integrated into the day-to-day credit risk 
management process of the Reporting Bank, and its output is an integral part of the process of planning, 
monitoring and controlling the Reporting Bank’s credit and overall risk profile.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-215  
8.5 
 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the senior management allocates sufficient 
resources to the collateral management unit to ensure an appropriate level of operational 
performance, as measured by the timeliness and accuracy of outgoing calls and response 
time to incoming calls. A Reporting Bank must ensure that the senior management 
adequately staffs the collateral management unit to process calls and disputes in a timely 
manner, even during a severe market crisis and to enable the Reporting Bank to limit its 
number of large disputes caused by trade volumes. 
 
8.6 
A Reporting Bank adopting the CCR internal models method must ensure that 
its cash management policies account simultaneously for the liquidity risks of potential 
incoming margin calls arising from the –  
 
(a)  exchanges of variation margin or other margin types378 under adverse 
market shocks; 
 
(b)  potential incoming calls for the return of excess collateral posted by 
counterparties; and 
 
(c)  calls resulting from a potential downgrade of its own public rating. 
 
8.7 
A Reporting Bank adopting the CCR internal models method must ensure that 
the nature and horizon of collateral reuse is consistent with its liquidity needs and does 
not jeopardise its ability to post or return collateral in a timely manner. 
 
 
Use Test 
 
8.8 
 
A Reporting Bank must not design and implement its models exclusively for the 
purposes of qualifying for the CCR internal models method. 
 
8.9 
 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the distribution of exposures generated by 
the model used to calculate effective EPE, based on current market data, and not based 
on a stress calibration, is closely integrated into the day-to-day CCR management process 
of the Reporting Bank. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the model’s output 
accordingly plays an essential role in the credit approval, CCR management, internal 
capital allocation, and corporate governance of the Reporting Bank.379  
 
8.10 
 
A Reporting Bank must have a credible track record in the use of models that 
generate a distribution of exposures to CCR. In this regard, the Reporting Bank must 
demonstrate that it has been using an internal model to calculate the distributions of 
exposures upon which the EPE calculation is based that meets, broadly, the minimum 
requirements set out in this Annex for at least one year before applying to the Authority 
for approval to use its internal model for estimating EPE. 
 
8.11   
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
 
378  
For example, initial or independent margin. 
379  
For example, a Reporting Bank may use the peak exposure from the distributions for counterparty credit 
limits or EPE for the Reporting Bank’s internal allocation of capital.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-216  
(a)  ensure that the model used to generate the distribution of CCR exposures 
is part of a CCR management framework that includes the identification, 
measurement, management, approval and internal reporting of CCR; 
 
(b)  ensure that the CCR management framework includes the measurement 
of usage of credit lines (aggregating CCR exposures with other credit 
exposures) and economic capital allocation; 
 
(c)  measure and manage current exposures in addition to EPE; and 
 
(d)  measure current exposure gross and net of collateral held, where 
appropriate. 
 
8.12 
 
The Authority will normally regard the use of other CCR measures by the 
Reporting Bank380 based on the distribution of CCR exposures that are generated by the 
same model used to compute EPE as having satisfied the use test. 
 
8.13 
 
A Reporting Bank must have the systems capability to estimate EE daily, if 
necessary, unless it is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that its CCR 
exposures, warrant less frequent calculation. The Reporting Bank must compute EE along 
a time profile of forecasting horizons that adequately reflects the time structure of future 
cash flows and maturity of the contracts and that is consistent with the materiality and 
composition of the exposures.381    
 
8.14 
 
A Reporting Bank must measure, monitor and control its CCR exposures over 
the life of all contracts in the netting set and not just to the one-year horizon. The 
Reporting Bank must have procedures in place to identify and control the risks for 
counterparties where the CCR exposures rises beyond the one-year horizon. In addition, 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that this forecasted increase in CCR exposures is an input 
into the economic capital model of the Reporting Bank. 
 
 
Stress Test 
 
8.15 
 
A Reporting Bank must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in 
the assessment of capital adequacy. The Reporting Bank must ensure that these stress 
measures are compared against the measure of EPE and considered by the Reporting Bank 
as part of its ICAAP as set out in Annex 10A. 
 
8.16 
 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its stress testing involves identifying 
possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable 
effects on its CCR exposures and assessing its ability to withstand such changes.382  
 
8.17 
A Reporting Bank must have a comprehensive stress testing programme for 
CCR that includes – 
 
 
380  
Examples include peak exposure and potential future exposure.  
381  
For example, the Reporting Bank may compute EE on a daily basis for the first 10 days, once a week out 
to one month, once a month out to eighteen months, once a quarter out to 5 years and beyond 5 years in 
a manner that is consistent with the materiality and composition of the exposure.  
382  
Examples of possible scenarios that could be used include economic or industry downturns, market place 
events, and decreased liquidity conditions.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-217  
(a)  complete trade capture and exposure aggregation across all forms of CCR, 
not just OTC derivative transactions, at the counterparty-specific level in 
a sufficient time frame to conduct regular stress testing; 
 
(b)  exposure stress testing for all counterparties of principal market risk 
factors, at least monthly383, in order to proactively identify, and where 
necessary, reduce outsized concentrations to specific directional 
sensitivities; 
 
(c)  multi-factor stress testing, which may be part of bank-wide stress testing, 
that addresses scenarios of –  
 
(i) 
severe economic or market events; 
 
(ii) 
significant decrease in broad market liquidity; and 
 
(iii) the market impact of liquidating positions of a large financial 
intermediary; 
 
(d)  the application of multifactor stress testing and assessment of material 
non-directional risks384 at least quarterly; 
 
(e)  the application of stressed market movements which have an impact not 
only on counterparty exposures, but also on the credit quality of 
counterparties; and at least quarterly, the conduct of stress testing 
applying stressed conditions to the joint movement of exposures and 
counterparty creditworthiness; 
 
(f)  the application of exposure stress testing (including single factor, multi-
factor and material non-directional risks) and joint stress testing of 
exposure and creditworthiness at both of the following levels385: 
 
(i) 
counterparty-specific;  
 
(ii) 
aggregate bank-wide CCR; 
 
(g)  for the purposes of evaluating solvency under stress, the application of 
factor shocks which are severe enough to capture historical extreme 
market environments and extreme but plausible stressed market 
conditions, and evaluation of the impact of such shocks on capital 
resources, capital requirements and earnings; and for the purposes of 
day-to-day 
portfolio 
monitoring, 
hedging 
and 
management 
of 
concentrations, the application of scenarios that are of lesser severity but 
higher probability; 
 
(h)  reverse stress testing to identify extreme but plausible scenarios that 
could result in significant adverse outcomes; and 
 
383  
For example, interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, credit spreads, or commodity prices. 
384  
For example, yield curve exposure or basis risks. 
385  
A Reporting Bank should also apply such stress testing at the level of groupings of counterparties based on 
the industry or region in which the counterparties operate. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-218  
 
(i)  
stress tests and scenario analyses that are designed to identify risk factors 
that are positively correlated with counterparty creditworthiness and to 
address the possibility of severe shocks occurring when relationships 
between risk factors have changed.  
 
8.18 
The Reporting Bank must integrate stress test results into regular reporting to 
senior management. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the analysis captures – 
 
(a)  the largest counterparty-level impacts across the portfolio; 
 
(b)  material concentrations within segments of the portfolio386; and 
 
(c)  relevant portfolio and counterparty specific trends. 
 
8.19 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management takes a lead role in 
the integration of stress testing into the risk management framework and risk culture of 
the Reporting Bank and ensure that the results are meaningful and proactively used to 
manage CCR. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the results of stress testing are 
compared to the risk appetite of the Reporting Bank and elevated for discussion and action 
when excessive or concentrated risks are present. 
 
 
Wrong-way Risk 
 
8.20 
A Reporting Bank must identify CCR exposures that give rise to a significant 
degree of general wrong-way risk. A Reporting Bank must monitor general wrong-way risk 
by product, region, industry and other categories that are germane to the business. 
 
8.21 
 
A Reporting Bank must have procedures in place to identify, monitor and control 
cases of specific wrong-way risk, beginning at the inception of a trade and continuing 
through the life of the transaction. 
 
8.22 
On a regular basis, a Reporting Bank must provide senior management and the 
Board with reports that communicate wrong-way risks and the steps that the Reporting 
Bank is taking to manage that risk. 
 
8.23 
A Reporting Bank must not include the instruments for which there exists a 
legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for which 
specific wrong-way risk has been identified, in the same netting set as other transactions 
with the counterparty.  
 
8.24 
For single-name credit default swaps where there exists a legal connection 
between the counterparty and the issuer of the underlying reference asset, and where 
specific wrong-way risk has been identified, a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
calculate E or EAD for such swap counterparty exposure as the full 
expected loss in the remaining fair value of the underlying reference asset 
assuming the issuer of the underlying reference asset is in default or 
 
386  
For example, within the same industry or region. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-219  
liquidation (i.e. assuming that the underlying reference asset has a PD of 
100%);   
 
(b) 
where the Reporting Bank is applying the IRBA in respect of the swap 
counterparty exposure and a non-zero recovery is assumed for the 
underlying reference asset, set LGD as 100% for the netting set assigned 
to the single-name credit default swap.  
 
(c) 
where the Reporting Bank is applying the SA(CR) in respect of the CCR 
exposure, treat the swap counterparty exposure as unsecured; and 
 
(d) 
calculate the capital requirement for the exposure to the underlying 
reference asset without recognising the effects of CRM of a single-name 
credit default swap which introduces specific wrong-way risk.   
 
8.25 
For transactions other than single-name credit default swaps387, where there 
exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying entity, and where 
specific wrong-way risk has been identified, a Reporting Bank must calculate E or EAD, as 
the value of the transaction under the assumption of a jump-to-default of the underlying 
reference asset. In as much this makes use of existing market risk calculations for IRC 
that already contain a LGD assumption, the Reporting Bank must ensure LGD is set as 
100%. 
 
 
Integrity of Modelling Process 
 
8.26 
 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that it has the internal controls needed to ensure 
the integrity of its model inputs. At a minimum, the Reporting Bank must comply with the 
requirements set out in paragraphs 8.27 to 8.32 of this Annex.  
 
8.27 
 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that, in respect of its transaction data, that – 
 
(a) 
the internal model reflects the transaction terms and specifications, 
including, but not limited to, transaction notional amounts, maturity, 
reference assets, margin thresholds, margining arrangements and netting 
agreements, in a timely, complete and conservative manner; 
 
(b) 
the transaction terms and specifications are maintained in a secure 
database that is subject to formal and periodic audit; 
 
(c) 
the process for recognising netting agreements involves a signoff by legal 
staff verifying the legal enforceability of netting and input of transaction 
terms and specifications into the database by an independent unit; 
 
(d) 
the transmission of transaction terms and specifications data to the model 
is subject to internal audit; and 
 
(e) 
there are formal reconciliation processes in place between the internal 
model and source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that 
 
387  
For example, equity derivatives, bond options or SFTs referencing a single entity. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-220  
transaction terms and specifications are being reflected in EPE correctly or 
at least conservatively. 
 
8.28 
 
A Reporting Bank must, when calibrating its effective EPE model using historical 
market data –    
 
(a)  employ current market data, regardless of whether it is directly observed 
or implied by other observable prices as at valuation date, to compute 
current exposures; 
 
(b)  estimate model parameters using at least 3 years of either –  
 
(i)  
historical market data; or 
 
(ii)  market implied data; and 
 
(c)  update such data quarterly or more frequently if market conditions 
warrant. 
 
8.29 
A Reporting Bank must, when calculating its effective EPE calculation using a 
stress calibration – 
 
(a)  use either –  
 
(i)  
3 years of historical market data that includes a period of stress to 
the credit default spreads of its counterparties; or 
 
(ii)  market implied data from a suitable period of stress; 
 
(b)  demonstrate, at least quarterly, that the stress period coincides with a 
period of increased credit default swap spreads or other credit spreads388 
for a representative selection of its counterparties with traded credit 
spreads; 
 
(c)  map each counterparty to specific credit spread data based on region, 
internal rating and business types for counterparties where there is no 
adequate credit spread data; 
 
(d)  for the exposure model for all counterparties, use either historic or implied 
data that includes the data from the stressed credit period, and in a 
manner consistent with the method used by the Reporting Bank for the 
calibration of the effective EPE model to current data;  
 
(e)  evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration for effective EPE by 
creating several benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the same 
main risk factors to which the Reporting Bank is exposed, and calculate 
the exposure to these benchmark portfolios using –  
 
 
388  
For example, loan or corporate bond spreads. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-221  
(i)  
current positions at current market prices, and stressed volatilities, 
stressed correlations and other relevant stressed exposure model 
inputs from the 3-year stress period; and   
 
(ii)  current positions at end of stress period market prices, and stressed 
volatilities, stressed correlations and other relevant stressed 
exposure model inputs from the 3-year stress period; and 
 
(f) 
adjust the stress calibration appropriately if the exposures of these 
benchmark portfolios deviate substantially. 
 
8.30 
For OTC derivative transactions, if a Reporting Bank recognises in its 
calculations of E or EAD, whichever is applicable, the effect of collateral other than cash of 
the same currency as the exposure itself, and it is not able to model collateral jointly with 
the exposure, it must use the standard supervisory haircuts under Annex 7J. For mixed 
currency exposures, the Reporting Bank must apply the FX haircut to collateral that is 
provided in a different currency to the exposure. 
 
8.31 
If the internal model of the Reporting Bank includes the effect of collateral on 
changes in the market value of the netting set, the Reporting Bank must model collateral, 
other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, jointly with the exposure in 
its calculations of E or EAD, whichever is applicable, for SFTs. 
 
8.32 
 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the EPE model (and modifications made to 
it) is subject to a validation process that – 
 
(a) 
is clearly articulated in the policies and procedures of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(b) 
specifies the kind of testing needed to ensure model integrity; 
 
(c) 
identifies conditions under which assumptions are violated and may result 
in an understatement of EPE; and 
 
(d) 
includes a review of the comprehensiveness of the EPE model389. 
 
8.33   
A Reporting Bank must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that it 
meets the minimum criteria for approval to adopt the IMA to calculate market RWA set 
out in paragraph 8.3.12, but in the context of assessing CCR. In particular, a Reporting 
Bank must ensure that –   
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank’s risk management process and system for assessing 
CCR is conceptually sound and is implemented with integrity; 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank has sufficient numbers of staff skilled in the use of 
sophisticated models not only in the trading area but also in the risk 
control, audit, and if necessary, back office areas; 
  
(c)  the Reporting Bank’s models have a proven track record of reasonable 
accuracy in measuring CCR; and 
 
 
389  
For example, whether the EPE model covers all products that have a material contribution to CCR. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-222  
(d)  the Reporting Bank regularly conducts stress tests in accordance with the 
requirements set out in paragraphs 8.15 to 8.19 of this Annex.

Annex 7F 
 
CALCULATION OF EAD* USING VAR MODELS FOR SFTs 
 
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank that uses the IRBA and has received approval from the 
Authority to use the IMA for calculating market RWA for one or more trading desks may 
use VaR models to calculate EAD* for SFTs in accordance with paragraph 1.2 of this Annex. 
A Reporting Bank must notify the Authority at least 3 months prior to the use of such VaR 
models.  
 
1.2 
A Reporting Bank using VaR models must calculate EAD*, using the following 
formula: 
 
EAD* 
= 
max {0, [ (∑𝐸𝐴𝐷− ∑𝐶) + Add-on]} 
 
where – 
 
(a) 
EAD* 
=  
exposure value after credit risk mitigation; 
 
(b) 
EAD  
=  
fair value of all cash and collateral lent, sold with an 
agreement to repurchase or otherwise posted to the 
counterparty;  
 
(c) 
C 
= 
fair value of all cash and collateral borrowed, 
purchased with an agreement to resell or otherwise 
held by the Reporting Bank; and 
 
(d)  Add-on 
=  
calculated using VaR models in accordance with 
paragraph 1.4 of this Annex. 
 
1.3 
A Reporting Bank using VaR models must – 
 
(a)  ensure that the collateral is revalued on a daily basis;  
 
(b)  ensure that the collateral is not a securitisation exposure;  
 
(c)  calculate VaR at a 99th percentile to calculate the counterparty credit risk 
for SFTs, even though the Reporting Bank must compute ES at a 97.5th 
percentile for the calculation of IMA capital requirements. To avoid doubt, 
the Reporting Bank need not calculate the default risk charge set out in 
paragraphs 8.3.213 to 8.3.240 as part of the calculation of VaR; 
 
(d)  ensure that the VaR model satisfies the backtesting requirements and the 
PLA test set out in paragraph 8.3.17 on an ongoing basis; and 
 
(e)  use a minimum holding period of 10-business days except in the case of 
margined repo-style transactions, for which it must use a minimum 
holding period of 5 business days390.  
 
390 
A Reporting Bank should adjust the minimum holding period upwards for any financial instrument where 
the specified holding period would be inappropriate given the liquidity of the instrument concerned.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-224  
 
1.4 
For the purposes of calculating the add-on in paragraph 1.2 of this Annex, a 
Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
identify a sample of 20 counterparties, on an annual basis, which must 
include the 10 largest counterparties as determined by the Reporting Bank 
according to its own exposure measurement approach and 10 others 
selected at random; 
  
(b) 
determine the number of exceptions for the sample of 20 counterparties 
in accordance with paragraph 8.3.154; and 
 
(c) 
calculate the following: 
 
Add-on = (VaR output) x (VaR multiplier), 
 
where the VaR multiplier is determined by the number of exceptions in 
sub-paragraph (b) using Table 7F-1391:

When the outcome of the model consistently results in a large number of exceptions, either overall or for 
one significant counterparty, the Reporting Bank should review the model assumptions and make 
modifications as appropriate.

Annex 7G 
 
QUALIFYING BILATERAL NETTING AGREEMENTS AND QUALIFYING CROSS-
PRODUCT NETTING AGREEMENTS  
 
 
Section 1:  Introduction 
 
1.1 
A qualifying bilateral netting agreement is a bilateral netting agreement in 
respect of which the requirements set out in Sections 3 to 5 of this Annex are complied 
with. 
 
1.2 
A qualifying cross-product netting agreement is a cross-product netting 
agreement in respect of which the requirements set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this Annex 
are complied with. 
 
 
Section 2:  Scope of Application 
   
2.1 
A qualifying bilateral netting agreement involves a group of transactions 
between a Reporting Bank and a counterparty containing transactions in only one of the 
following product categories (collectively “Transactions”): 
 
(a)  OTC derivative transaction or long settlement transaction;  
 
(b)  repo, reverse repo, securities or commodities lending transaction and 
securities or commodities borrowing transaction;  
 
(c)  margin lending transaction.  
 
2.2 
A qualifying cross-product netting agreement involves a group of transactions 
between a Reporting Bank and a counterparty containing transactions in 2 or more of the 
product categories set out in paragraph 2.1 of this Annex. 
 
 
Section 3:  Requirements for Netting Agreements 
 
3.1 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
obtain a written independent legal opinion
392  that satisfies the 
requirements set out in paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of this Annex confirming 
that the netting agreement is valid, effective and enforceable for each of 
the following countries or jurisdictions:  
 
(i) 
the country or jurisdiction in which the counterparty is incorporated 
or established;   
 
 
392 
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal counsel, a Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel is independent of the parties originating transactions covered by the netting agreement. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-226  
(ii)  if a foreign branch of the Reporting Bank or the counterparty has 
entered or will be entering into the Transaction, the country or 
jurisdiction in which the branch of the Reporting Bank or the 
counterparty, as the case may be, is located;  
  
(iii)  the country or jurisdiction whose law governs the netting agreement;  
 
(iv) the country or jurisdiction whose law governs any Transaction in 
relation to the netting agreement if different from sub-paragraph 
(a)(iii), 
 
(referred to as “relevant countries or jurisdictions” in this Annex) and 
which satisfies the requirements set out in Section 4 of this Annex; and 
 
 
(b) 
in relation to a netting agreement containing Transactions in paragraph 
2.1(b) and (c) of this Annex, ensure that –  
 
(i) 
the netting agreement –  
 
(A) provides the non-defaulting party the right to terminate and 
close out in a timely manner all Transactions upon the 
occurrence of a termination event as defined in the netting 
agreement, including the default or insolvency of the defaulting 
party; and 
 
(B) allows for the prompt liquidation or set-off of collateral upon 
the event of default; and 
 
(ii) 
where the netting agreement covers Transactions in both the 
banking book and trading book, –  
 
(A) the Transactions are marked-to-market daily; and 
 
(B) the collateral in the Transactions are recognised as eligible 
financial collateral in the banking book in accordance with 
Annex 7H; and 
 
(c) 
provide to the Authority the information and documents set out in 
paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 of this Annex. 
 
3.2 
 A Reporting Bank must provide to the Authority a summary listing393 of the 
source and date of each legal opinion obtained for the purposes of paragraph 3.1(a) of 
this Annex, stating in each case, whether such legal opinion was commissioned specifically 
by the Reporting Bank, by the Reporting Bank collectively with any other party, or by some 
other third party. The Reporting Bank must provide to the Authority the summary listing 
no later than 15 months from the previous submission.  
  
 
393 
This can be prepared by either the in-house or external legal counsel of the Reporting Bank. A Reporting 
Bank should provide the summary listing to the Authority at least once every 12 months.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-227  
3.3 
The Authority may, where it considers it necessary, require a Reporting Bank 
to provide copies of, or access to, the netting agreement and the legal opinions obtained 
for the purposes of paragraph 3.1(a) of this Annex.  
 
 
Section 4:  Legal Opinions obtained for the purposes of paragraph 3.1(a) of this 
 
   Annex 
 
4.1 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the legal opinion – 
 
(a) 
is in the form of a memorandum of law and addressed directly to the 
Reporting Bank or the sponsors of a particular netting agreement or form 
of netting agreement394; or  
 
(b) 
is the product of a number of parties (including the Reporting Bank) 
pooling together to seek a collective opinion on a particular netting 
agreement.  
 
4.2 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the legal opinion, at a minimum395 – 
 
(a) 
confirms that in an event of default as defined under the netting 
agreement, 
including 
liquidation, 
bankruptcy 
or 
other 
similar 
circumstances of either the counterparty or the Reporting Bank, the courts 
and administrative authorities396 of the relevant country or jurisdiction will 
find that the claims and obligations of the Reporting Bank pursuant to the 
relevant Transactions would be limited to a net sum calculated in 
accordance with the netting agreement under the law of the relevant 
country or jurisdiction; 
 
(b) 
highlights the material clauses in the netting agreement that provide for 
the netting of Transactions (“material netting clauses”);  
 
(c) 
confirms that the unenforceability or illegality of any clause (other than a 
material netting clause) in the netting agreement is unlikely to undermine 
the material netting clauses referred to in sub-paragraph (a); 
 
(d) 
states the circumstances under which the netting agreement may be relied 
upon, including –  
 
(i)  
the legal form of, or activities conducted by, the counterparty; and  
 
(ii)  whether certain counterparties397 may be subject to special rules 
relating to insolvency as a result of the legal form of, or activities 
conducted by, the counterparties;  
 
 
394  
The Authority would normally consider independent legal opinions commissioned and collated by ISDA as 
complying with the requirements set out in paragraphs 4.1 to 4.5 of this Annex.         
395  
This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the matters that should be covered in a legal opinion 
obtained for the purposes of paragraph 3.1(a) of this Annex. 
396  
This includes a court-appointed administrator and an administrator appointed by a regulatory authority.

For example, banks, insurance companies, or local authorities. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

(e) 
states whether the netting or other default provisions in the netting 
agreement are enforceable or enforceable differently (and if so, the extent 
of the difference) in a non-liquidation event398; 
 
(f) 
states to what extent, if at all, the netting needs to be reflected in the 
records of the counterparties in order for it to be valid, effective and 
enforceable; 
 
(g) 
states whether a court or administrative authority in the country or 
jurisdiction covered by the legal opinion would uphold the rate chosen for 
the conversion of foreign currency obligations for the purposes of 
calculating the close-out amount and whether there are any statutory or 
other applicable rules that may affect this aspect of the netting agreement; 
 
(h) 
states whether, under the law of the country or jurisdiction covered by the 
legal opinion, it is necessary for the enforceability of the netting that all 
Transactions be regarded as part of a single agreement, and if so, whether 
there is anything in the close-out methodology which may be held to be 
inconsistent with the treatment of all Transactions as part of a single 
agreement and the effect it may have on the netting; 
 
(i) 
states whether there is any reason to believe that the netting agreement 
would be unenforceable because of the law of another country or 
jurisdiction; 
 
(j) 
states whether there is any preference specified in the netting agreement 
for automatic rather than optional close-out, and if so, whether such 
preference would affect the enforceability of the netting agreement;  
 
(k) 
states whether there are legal problems in exercising any discretion or 
flexibility provided for in the netting agreement, and if so, whether such 
problems affect the enforceability of the netting agreement; and 
 
(l) 
if other clauses are added to a standard form agreement, confirms that 
such additional clauses do not throw any reasonable doubt or affect the 
overall validity, effectiveness or enforceability of the netting agreement. 
 
4.3 
The Authority is aware that it may not be possible for a Reporting Bank to obtain 
a legal opinion that provides a definitive view on the validity, effectiveness and 
enforceability of the netting agreement without certain assumptions or qualifications.  The 
presence per se of assumptions and qualifications within the legal opinion will not render 
the legal opinion unsatisfactory for the purposes of this Notice. However, the Reporting 
Bank must ensure that assumptions underlying the legal opinion are not unduly restrictive, 
and are specific, of a factual nature and adequately explained within the legal opinion. 
Where qualifications are made, the Reporting Bank must ensure that such qualifications 
are specific and their effect is adequately explained within the legal opinion. A Reporting 
Bank must examine and assess the assumptions and qualifications in the legal opinion.  
 
 
398  
For example, administration, judicial management, receivership, voluntary arrangement, or scheme of 
arrangement. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-229  
4.4 
If the Reporting Bank determines that – 
  
(a) 
the absence of any of the information listed in paragraph 4.2 of this Annex; 
or 
 
(b) 
any of the assumptions or qualifications in the legal opinion, 
 
gives rise to reasonable doubt as to the validity, effectiveness or enforceability of the 
netting agreement, the Reporting Bank must not treat the netting agreement as a 
qualifying bilateral netting agreement or a qualifying cross-product netting agreement, as 
the case may be.  
 
4.5 
In this regard, where there is more than one relevant country or jurisdiction in 
relation to a netting agreement, the Reporting Bank must not treat the netting agreement 
as a qualifying bilateral netting agreement or a qualifying cross-product netting agreement, 
as the case may be, if the Reporting Bank has any reasonable doubt, based on its own 
evaluation of the legal opinions, as to whether the netting agreement is valid, effective 
and enforceable in any relevant country or jurisdiction considering the potential for 
conflicts of laws and whether action may be taken by insolvency officials in other countries 
or jurisdictions.    
 
4.6 
The Reporting Bank must review each legal opinion 399 and obtain updates 
thereto, either in the form of a fresh legal opinion or a letter from an external firm of 
lawyers confirming that the opinion on the validity, effectiveness and enforceability of the 
netting agreement remains unchanged. The Reporting Bank must review each legal 
opinion no later than 15 months from the previous review. The Reporting Bank must also 
document the sources of the legal opinions, and the expertise of the persons giving the 
legal opinions. 
 
4.7 
Despite paragraph 3.1(a) of this Annex, where any relevant country or 
jurisdiction does not recognise netting or recognises netting only in a limited form, the 
Reporting Bank must report Transactions for which that country or jurisdiction is a relevant 
country or jurisdiction on a gross basis. The Reporting Bank may report all other 
Transactions under the same netting agreement on a net basis. 
 
4.8 
The Reporting Bank must alert the Authority immediately when it becomes 
aware of any relevant country or jurisdiction that does not recognise netting or recognises 
netting only in a limited form (whether as to certain products, or with counterparties of 
certain legal forms or counterparties performing certain activities). 
 
4.9 
Where a Reporting Bank is aware that a supervisory authority of the 
counterparty of the Reporting Bank (whether the supervisory authority is the home or host 
supervisor) is not satisfied that a netting agreement is legally valid, effective or 
enforceable under the law of the country or jurisdiction of that supervisory authority, the 
Reporting Bank must not treat the netting agreement as a qualifying bilateral netting 
agreement or a qualifying cross-product netting agreement, as the case may be, despite 
any legal opinion obtained by the Reporting Bank. 
 
 
 
399  
A Reporting Bank should review each legal opinion at least once every 12 months. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-230  
Section 5: Policies, Systems and Controls  
 
5.1 
A Reporting Bank must have in place a netting policy that sets out, at a 
minimum, all of the following: 
 
(a) 
the person responsible for setting and reviewing the policy on netting; 
 
(b) 
the frequency of review of the netting policy;  
 
(c) 
the person responsible for approving the application of a netting 
agreement to any Transaction (including determining whether the netting 
agreement is covered by an existing legal opinion or whether separate 
legal opinions are required); 
 
(d) 
how the Reporting Bank monitors legal developments affecting its netting 
agreements and the need to obtain additional legal opinions;  
 
(e) 
what the Reporting Bank is to include in its netting agreements to ensure 
that its interests, rights and obligations are duly reflected;  
 
(f) 
the processes for determining and reporting net exposures to individual 
counterparties.  
 
5.2 
The Reporting Bank must also have in place adequate systems and controls to 
monitor the Transactions, including systems and controls to ensure that – 
 
(a) 
only Transactions entered into by the Reporting Bank with a counterparty 
that are covered by a netting agreement are netted;     
 
(b) 
net exposures arising from such Transactions, including net exposures of 
each branch of the Reporting Bank against each branch of the 
counterparty, where applicable, are accurately determined and reported;  
 
(c) 
documentary evidence of the Transactions subject to netting are 
maintained and appropriately safeguarded and the Reporting Bank is able 
to produce such documentary evidence, if required by the Authority;  
 
(d)  the legal opinions are not superceded by subsequent changes in the laws 
of the relevant countries or jurisdictions and that all of the following are 
duly documented and updated no later than 15 months from the previous 
update400: 
 
(i) 
the types of counterparties and Transactions covered by each netting 
agreement;  
 
(ii) 
the relevant countries or jurisdictions for each netting agreement to 
which the Reporting Bank is a party. The Reporting Bank must note 
any country or jurisdiction for which any doubt may exist as to the 
legal validity, effectiveness or enforceability of netting and what 
action the Reporting Bank has taken as a result;   
 
400  
A Reporting Bank should review each legal opinion at least once every 12 months. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-231  
 
(e) 
counterparty limits are monitored in terms of such net exposures; and 
 
(f) 
potential roll-off exposures, which occur upon maturity of short-dated 
obligations that are netted against longer dated claims, are monitored. 
 
5.3 
A Reporting Bank must maintain adequate documentation in relation to meeting 
the requirements in Sections 3 and 4 of this Annex at all times. 
 
 
Section 6: Qualifying Cross-Product Netting Agreement 
 
6.1 
A Reporting Bank may recognise the effect of a qualifying cross-product netting 
agreement only if it has received approval to use the CCR internal models method for 
estimating its pre-settlement counterparty exposures.  
 
6.2 
A Reporting Bank must have a legally valid, effective and enforceable cross-
product netting agreement in place with its counterparty in respect of which the 
requirements set out in Sections 3 and 4 of this Annex are complied with.  
 
6.3 
A Reporting Bank must also have in place adequate policies, systems and 
controls to monitor the Transactions under a cross-product netting agreement and must 
comply with the requirements in Section 5 of this Annex.  
 
6.4 
In addition to Sections 3 to 5 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must ensure the 
following:  
 
(a)  the cross-product netting agreement clearly specifies all included bilateral 
master agreements and Transactions;  
 
(b) 
the cross-product netting agreement provides that in the event of default 
including liquidation, bankruptcy and other similar circumstances of either 
counterparty or upon the occurrence of a termination event as defined in 
the cross-product netting agreement, the values of all included 
Transactions must be combined and reduced to a single payable sum; 
 
(c) 
the legal opinion referred to in Section 4 of this Annex addresses the 
validity, effectiveness and enforceability of the entire cross-product 
netting agreement under its terms and the impact of the cross-product 
netting agreement on the material provisions of any included bilateral 
master agreement;  
 
(d) 
the net sum referred to in paragraph 4.2(a) of this Annex is the net sum 
of the positive and negative close-out values of any included individual 
bilateral master agreement and of the positive and negative marked-to-
market value of the individual Transactions;  
 
(e) 
procedures are put in place pursuant to paragraph 5.2(d) of this Annex to 
verify that any included Transaction is covered by a legal opinion which 
complies with the requirements set out in Sections 3, 4 and 6 of this Annex;  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-232  
(f) 
all included bilateral master agreements and transactions comply with the 
requirements set out in Sections 3 and 4 of this Annex, and paragraphs 
1.1 and 1.2 of Annex 7H.  
 
6.5 
A Reporting Bank must manage its CCR by factoring the effects of netting in its 
measurement of the aggregate credit risk exposure of each counterparty.  
 
6.6 
A Reporting Bank must aggregate exposures to each counterparty to arrive at 
a single exposure across Transactions and to factor this aggregation into its internal credit 
limit setting and monitoring processes for each counterparty. A Reporting Bank must also 
incorporate the aggregated exposure for each counterparty into its internal economic 
capital process.  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-233  
Annex 7H 
 
CRM  
 
 
Section 1:  General Requirements  
1.1 
A Reporting Bank may recognise the effects of CRM only if –  
 
(a)  all documentation relating to that CRM is binding on all relevant parties 
and legally enforceable in all relevant countries or jurisdictions; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank conducts sufficient legal review to verify all the 
matters mentioned in sub-paragraph (a), including by obtaining a written 
independent legal opinion, to confirm the matters mentioned in sub-
paragraph (a) and to ensure that the documentation mentioned in sub-
paragraph (a) does not cease to be enforceable401 ; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank complies with the requirements402 set out in Sections 
2 to 8 of this Annex, as applicable;  
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank complies with the public disclosure requirements in 
Part XI; and 
 
(e) 
where that CRM is a guarantee or credit derivative and the Reporting Bank 
is using SA(CR), F-IRBA or the supervisory slotting criteria, the CRM is 
provided by an eligible protection provider.  
 
1.2 
A Reporting Bank must keep, for 5 years, and make available at the request of 
the Authority, a record of the review mentioned in paragraph 1.1(b) of this Annex.  
 
1.3 
Where a Reporting Bank uses multiple CRM for a single exposure, the Reporting 
Bank must sub-divide the exposure into portions covered by each CRM 403 and must 
calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount of each portion separately. A Reporting 
Bank must apply the same approach when recognising eligible credit protection by a single 
protection provider where the eligible credit protection has differing maturities. 
 
1.4 
If the Authority is not satisfied that paragraph 1.1 of this Annex has been 
complied with, or with the robustness, suitability or application of a Reporting Bank’s CRM 
 
401  
A Reporting Bank should ensure that –   
(a)  the review covers relevant countries or jurisdictions such as the country or jurisdiction whose law 
governs the credit protection or collateral agreement and the country or jurisdiction whose law governs 
the transaction in relation to the credit protection or collateral agreement; and  
(b)  there should be sufficient written documentary evidence to adequately support the conclusion drawn 
and rebut any legal challenge.   
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel, it should consider whether 
or not an in-house counsel opinion is appropriate. A Reporting Bank should ensure that an officer of the 
Reporting Bank who is legally qualified and independent of the parties originating the transaction reviews 
the legal opinion and confirms that he is satisfied that an adequate review has been completed and that he 
agrees with the conclusions drawn.   
402  
A Reporting Bank should comply with the guidelines set out in Sections 2 to 8 of this Annex, as applicable. 
403  
For example, for an exposure covered by both collateral and a guarantee, the exposure is divided into a 
portion covered by collateral, and a portion covered by a guarantee. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-234  
management policies and procedures, or where residual risks are not adequately 
controlled, the Authority may take certain actions, including any or all of the following:    
 
(a) 
requiring the Reporting Bank to make adjustments to the assumptions on 
holding periods, supervisory haircuts under Annex 7J;  
 
(b) 
prohibiting the Reporting Bank from fully recognising the effects of CRM, 
either on the entire credit portfolio or by specific asset classes or product 
lines;  
 
(c) 
requiring the Reporting Bank to maintain additional capital.  
 
1.5 
A Reporting Bank must not do any of the following:  
 
(a)  double count the effects of CRM; 
 
(b)  recognise the effects of CRM if such CRM is already reflected in the issue-
specific external credit assessment of the exposure; 
 
(c)  use a principal-only external credit assessment (i.e. an external credit 
assessment that does not reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure 
that the Reporting Bank has with regard to all payments owed to it) for 
the recognition of the effects of CRM.   
1.6 
A Reporting Bank must not recognise the effects of CRM if the credit quality of 
the counterparty has a material positive correlation with the CRM technique used or with 
the resulting residual risks set out in paragraph 8.1 of this Annex404.  
Section 2:  Recognition of Collateral 
 
 
 
Types of Collateral 
 
2.1 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the relevant requirements in paragraphs 
2.13 to 2.25, and Section 3 of this Annex are complied with before it recognises the effects 
of CRM of the types of collateral set out in paragraphs 2.2 to 2.12 of this Annex. 
 
2.2 
For a Reporting Bank using the SA(CR) and the FC(SA), eligible financial 
collateral excludes any CET1 capital instrument, AT1 capital instrument or Tier 2 capital 
instrument issued by the Reporting Bank which is held by the Reporting Bank as collateral, 
and comprises –  
 
(a) 
cash and certificates of deposit or other instruments similar to certificates 
of deposit issued by the Reporting Bank, but excluding structured deposits 
as defined under regulation 2 of the Financial Advisers (Structured 
Deposits – Prescribed Investment Product and Exemption) Regulations;  
 
(b) 
gold; 
 
 
404  
For example, securities issued by the counterparty or any related group entity must not qualify as eligible 
financial collateral. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-235  
(c) 
any debt security, which includes any structured note – 
 
(i) 
with an original maturity of one year or less that has a credit quality 
grade of “III” or better as set out in Table 7M-2, where the credit 
quality grade is determined in accordance with paragraph 7.3.30 and 
based on an issue-specific external credit assessment of the debt 
security or an issuer external credit assessment in accordance with 
paragraph 2.3 of this Annex;  
 
(ii)  with an original maturity of more than one year that has a credit 
quality grade of “4” or better as set out in Table 7M-1 if it is issued 
by a central government or central bank, where the credit quality 
grade is determined in accordance with paragraph 7.3.30 and based 
on an issue-specific external credit assessment of the debt security 
or an issuer external credit assessment (where paragraph 2.3 of this 
Annex applies); or 
 
(iii)  with an original maturity of more than one year that has a credit 
quality grade of “3” or better as set out in Table 7M-1 if it is issued 
by any entity other than a central government or central bank, where 
the credit quality grade is determined based on an issue-specific 
external credit assessment of the debt security and in accordance 
with paragraph 7.3.30;  
 
(d) 
any equity security (including convertible bonds) that is included in a main 
index; and 
 
(e) 
any unit in a collective investment scheme where – 
 
(i) 
a price for the units is publicly quoted daily; and 
 
(ii) 
the collective investment scheme is limited to investing in the 
instruments listed in this paragraph. 
 
 
2.3 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.2(c) of this Annex, when determining the credit 
quality grade of a debt security issued by a central government or central bank where no 
issue-specific external credit assessment is available, the Reporting Bank may – 
 
(a)  rely on the issuer external credit assessment to determine the credit 
quality grade of the debt security; and 
 
(b)  where no issuer external credit assessment is available for a central bank, 
rely on the issuer external credit assessment of the central government of 
the country or jurisdiction of the central bank, to determine the credit 
quality grade of the debt security issued by the central bank. 
 
2.4 
To avoid doubt, a debt security issued by a PSE which is risk-weighted at 0% 
or 20% under the SA(CR) pursuant to paragraph 7.3.48 and Table 7-3 is an eligible 
financial collateral pursuant to paragraph 2.2(c)(iii) of this Annex if such a debt security 
has a credit quality grade of “3” or better. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-236  
2.5 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.2(e) of this Annex, the use or potential use by 
a collective investment scheme of derivative instruments solely to hedge investments in 
instruments listed in paragraph 2.2 of this Annex does not prevent units in that collective 
investment scheme from being recognised by the Reporting Bank as eligible financial 
collateral under paragraph 2.2(e) of this Annex. 
 
2.6 
Resecuritisations, irrespective of any credit ratings, are not eligible financial 
collateral. This prohibition applies whether the Reporting Bank is using the supervisory 
haircuts method, the repo VaR method or the internal model method.  
 
2.7 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.2(a) of this Annex, where cash-funded credit-
linked notes issued by the Reporting Bank against exposures in the banking book fulfil the 
criteria for eligible credit derivatives, except for the criteria in paragraph 1.1(e) of this 
Annex for the CRM to be provided by an eligible protection provider in the case where the 
Reporting Bank is using the SA(CR), the F-IRBA or the supervisory slotting criteria, the 
Reporting Bank must treat such instruments as cash collateralised transactions. 
 
2.8 
For a Reporting Bank using the SA(CR) and the FC(CA), or the F-IRBA, eligible 
financial collateral excludes any CET1 capital instrument, AT1 capital instrument or Tier 2 
capital instrument issued by the Reporting Bank which is held by the Reporting Bank as 
collateral, and comprises – 
 
(a) 
any instrument listed in paragraph 2.2 of this Annex; 
 
(b) 
any equity security (including convertible bonds) that is listed on any 
approved exchange or overseas exchange; and 
 
(c) 
any unit in a collective investment scheme where a price for the units is 
publicly quoted daily and the collective investment scheme is limited to 
investing in instruments listed in paragraph 2.2 of this Annex and in this 
paragraph. 
 
2.9 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.8(c) of this Annex, the use or potential use by 
a collective investment scheme of derivative instruments solely to hedge investments in 
instruments listed in paragraph 2.8 of this Annex does not prevent units in that collective 
investment scheme from being recognised by the Reporting Bank as eligible financial 
collateral under paragraph 2.8(c) of this Annex. 
 
2.10 
Despite paragraphs 2.2 and 2.8 of this Annex, in the case of any pre-settlement 
counterparty exposures arising from a repo-style transaction which is included in the 
trading book, eligible financial collateral includes all instruments which a Reporting Bank 
may include in the trading book (except resecuritisation exposures).  
 
2.11 
For a Reporting Bank adopting the F-IRBA, eligible IRBA collateral comprises –  
 
(a) 
eligible CRE and eligible RRE; 
 
(b) 
eligible receivables; and 
 
(c) 
eligible physical collateral comprising – 
 
(i) 
all industrial properties in Singapore; 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-237  
 
(ii) 
land in Singapore;   
 
(iii) land in another country or jurisdiction where the bank regulatory 
agency has recognised such land as eligible physical collateral; 
 
(iv)  ships;  
 
(v) 
aircraft;  
 
(vi) commodities; and  
 
(vii) such other collateral which is approved by the Authority. 
  
2.12 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.11 of this Annex, “commodity” means –  
 
(a)  any produce, item, good or article; or  
 
(b)  any index, right or interest in any produce, item, good or article.  
 
 
 
Requirements for Recognition of Collateral 
 
2.13 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that all of the following requirements are 
complied with, before it recognises the effects of CRM of any collateral and on an ongoing 
basis for as long as it continues, to recognise the effects of CRM of any collateral: 
 
(a)  the legal mechanism by which collateral is pledged, assigned or 
transferred must confer on the Reporting Bank the right to liquidate or 
take legal possession of the collateral, in a timely manner, in the event of 
the default, insolvency or bankruptcy (or one or more otherwise-defined 
credit events set out in the transaction documentation) of the counterparty 
(and, where applicable, of the custodian holding the collateral);  
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank has taken all steps necessary to fulfil those 
requirements under the law applicable to the Reporting Bank’s interest in 
the collateral for obtaining and maintaining an enforceable security 
interest405 or for exercising a right to net or set off in relation to title 
transfer collateral;  
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank has implemented clear and robust procedures for the 
timely liquidation of collateral to ensure that any legal conditions required 
for declaring default of counterparty and liquidating the collateral are 
observed, and that the collateral can be liquidated promptly;  
 
(d)  where the collateral is held by a custodian, the Reporting Bank has taken 
reasonable steps to ensure that the custodian segregates the collateral 
from its own assets.  
 
405  
For example, by registering it with a registrar. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-238  
2.14 
In addition to the requirements in paragraph 2.13 of this Annex, a Reporting 
Bank must ensure that all of the following requirements are complied with, before it 
recognises CRE or RRE held as collateral as eligible CRE or eligible RRE and on an ongoing 
basis for as long as it continues, to recognise CRE or RRE held as collateral as eligible CRE 
or eligible RRE: 
 
(a) 
the repayment of the facility is not materially dependent on any cash flow 
generated by the CRE or RRE, but rather on the underlying capacity of the 
obligor to repay the facility from other sources; 
 
(b)  the value of the CRE or RRE that is pledged is not materially dependent 
on the performance of the obligor;  
 
(c)  any claim on collateral is properly filed on a timely basis; 
 
(d)  collateral interests reflect a perfected charge wherein all legal 
requirements for establishing the claim are fulfilled; 
 
(e)  the collateral agreement and the process for enforcement of the 
agreement allow the Reporting Bank to realise the value of such collateral 
within a reasonable timeframe; 
 
(f)  the CRE or RRE is valued at or less than the fair value at which the property 
could be sold under a private contract between a willing seller and an 
arm’s-length buyer on the date of valuation; 
 
(g)  the Reporting Bank obtains a formal valuation by an independent 
accredited valuer at origination and revalues the CRE or RRE at least on 
an annual basis thereafter;  
 
(h)  where the Reporting Bank has a junior charge over the CRE or RRE, the 
conditions under paragraph 7.4.77 are satisfied; 
 
(i)  
the Reporting Bank clearly documents the types of CRE or RRE accepted 
by the Reporting Bank as collateral and lending policies 406 when such 
collateral may be taken; 
 
(j)  the Reporting Bank ensures that the CRE or RRE is adequately insured 
against damage or deterioration;  
 
(k)  the Reporting Bank monitors the extent of any permissible prior claims407 
on the CRE or RRE on an ongoing basis;  
 
(l)  
the Reporting Bank appropriately monitors the risk of environmental 
liability arising in respect of the CRE or RRE408. 
 
2.15 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.14 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must not 
recognise any IPRE that is part of the SL asset sub-class as eligible CRE or eligible RRE.  
 
406  
For example, advance rates. 
407  
For example, tax. 
408  
For example, the presence of toxic material on a property. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-239  
 
2.16 
The requirement in paragraph 2.14(b) of this Annex does not prevent the 
Reporting Bank from recognising CRE or RRE held as collateral as eligible CRE or eligible 
RRE, where purely macro-economic factors affect both the value of the CRE or RRE held 
as collateral and the performance of the obligor. 
 
2.17 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.14(g) of this Annex, the Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
have in place policies addressing matters including the frequency of 
revaluation, the procedures for revaluation under various market 
circumstances, and the revaluation methods and approaches to be used 
in each circumstance which may include statistical methods409 or a formal 
revaluation by an independent accredited valuer410; and 
 
(b)  obtain a formal revaluation by an independent accredited valuer on the 
valuation of the CRE or RRE if the Reporting Bank assesses that the value 
of the CRE or RRE may have declined materially relative to general market 
prices or when a credit event411 occurs. 
 
2.18 
In addition to the requirements in paragraph 2.13 of this Annex, a Reporting 
Bank must ensure that all of the following requirements are complied with, before it 
recognises any financial receivables as eligible receivables and on an ongoing basis for as 
long as it continues, to recognise any financial receivables as eligible receivables:  
  
(a)  the financial receivables have an original maturity of one year or less;  
 
(b)  the repayment occurs through the commercial or financial flows related to 
the underlying assets of the obligor which include both self-liquidating 
debt arising from the sale of goods or services linked to a commercial 
transaction and general amounts owed by buyers, suppliers, renters, 
national and local governmental authorities, or other non-affiliated parties 
not related to the sale of goods or services linked to a commercial 
transaction, but excludes receivables associated with securitisation, sub-
participations or credit derivatives; 
 
(c)  the legal mechanism by which collateral is given is robust and ensures 
that the Reporting Bank has clear rights over the proceeds from the 
collateral;  
 
(d) 
framework, policies and procedures to ensure that the Reporting Bank has 
a perfected first charge over the collateral is in place;  
 
 
409  
For example, reference to property indices and sampling.   
410  
A Reporting Bank should regularly backtest and benchmark statistical methods, where possible, so that the 
results obtained are robust. A Reporting Bank may also use statistical methods to identify real estate that 
may have declined in value and that may need revaluation. In general, a Reporting Bank should undertake 
a formal revaluation regularly. 
411  
For example, default.

7-240  
(e)  collateral arrangements are properly documented, and clear and robust 
procedures for the timely collection of collateral proceeds412 are in place413; 
 
(f)  a sound process for determining the credit risk in the receivables is in 
place414. Where the Reporting Bank relies on the obligor to ascertain the 
credit risk of the obligor’s customers in respect of the receivables, it must 
review the obligor’s credit policy to ascertain its soundness and credibility; 
 
(g)  the margin between the amount of the exposure and the value of the 
receivables reflects all appropriate factors, including the cost of collection, 
concentration within the receivables pool pledged by an individual obligor, 
and potential concentration risk within the total exposures of the Reporting 
Bank;  
 
(h)  a continuous monitoring process 415 that is appropriate for the specific 
exposures (either immediate or contingent) attributable to the collateral 
is in place;  
 
(i)  
the receivables pledged by an obligor are diversified and are not unduly 
correlated416 with the obligor; 
 
(j) 
the receivables are not from any of the following: 
 
(i)  
related corporations of the obligor; 
 
(ii) 
associates of the obligor;  
 
(iii)  officers of the obligor;  
 
(iv) employees of the obligor; 
 
(v)  entities which the obligor is an associate of. 
 
412  
A Reporting Bank should have procedures in place to ensure that all legal conditions required for declaring 
the default of the obligor and timely collection of collateral are observed. In the event of the financial 
distress or default of the obligor, the Reporting Bank should have legal authority to sell or assign the 
receivables to other parties without the consent of the receivables’ obligors.  
413  
A Reporting Bank should have a documented process for collecting receivable payments in distressed 
situations. A Reporting Bank should ensure that the requisite facilities for collection are in place, even when 
the Reporting Bank normally looks to the obligor for collections. 
414  
Such a process should include analyses of the obligor’s business and industry (e.g. effects of the business 
cycle) and the types of customers with whom the obligor does business.  
415 
This process may include, as appropriate and relevant, ageing reports, control of trade documents, 
borrowing base certificates, frequent audits of collateral, confirmation of accounts, control of the proceeds 
of accounts paid, analyses of dilution and regular financial analysis of both the obligor and the issuers of 
the receivables, especially in the case when a small number of large-sized receivables are taken as collateral. 
A Reporting Bank should monitor whether its overall concentration limits are being observed. A Reporting 
Bank should also review on a regular basis the compliance with loan covenants, environmental restrictions 
and other legal requirements. 
416  
Where the correlation is high, such as where some issuers of the receivables are reliant on the obligor for 
their viability or the obligor and the issuers belong to a common industry, the attendant risks should be 
taken into account in the setting of margins for the collateral pool as a whole.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-241  
 
2.19 
In addition to the requirements in paragraph 2.13, paragraph 2.14(c) to (g) 
and paragraph 2.14(i) to (l) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must ensure that all of the 
following requirements are complied with, before it recognises any physical collateral as 
eligible physical collateral and on an ongoing basis for as long as it continues, to recognise 
any physical collateral as eligible physical collateral:  
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank has first charge over the collateral; 
 
(b)  the facility agreement includes detailed descriptions of the collateral and 
provides the Reporting Bank with the right to examine and revalue the 
collateral whenever it is deemed necessary by the Reporting Bank;  
 
(c)  the types of physical collateral accepted by the Reporting Bank and 
policies and practices in respect of the appropriate amount of each type of 
collateral relative to the exposure amount is clearly documented in its 
internal credit policies and procedures, and available for examination and 
audit review;  
 
 
(d)  the credit policies of a Reporting Bank with regard to the transaction 
structure addresses appropriate collateral requirements relative to the 
exposure amount, the ability to liquidate the collateral readily, the ability 
to establish objectively a price or market value, the frequency with which 
the value can readily be obtained (including a professional appraisal or 
valuation), and the volatility of the value of the collateral; 
 
 
(e)  the periodic revaluation process involves a review of “fashion-sensitive” 
collateral to ensure that valuations are appropriately adjusted downward 
for fashion or model-year obsolescence as well as physical obsolescence 
or deterioration, and includes physical inspection of the collateral where 
inventories417 and equipment are involved; 
 
(f) 
the Reporting Bank is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Authority that there exists liquid markets for the disposal of the collateral 
in an expeditious and economically efficient manner;  
 
(g) 
the Reporting Bank is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Authority that there exists publicly available market prices for the 
collateral which are generally relied upon by the market, and that the 
amount received by the Reporting Bank when the collateral is realised 
does not deviate significantly from these market prices;  
 
(h)  steps are taken to adequately insure the collateral against damage or 
deterioration.   
 
2.20 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.19 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must read 
references to CRE or RRE in paragraph 2.14(c) to (g) and paragraph 2.14(i) to (l) of this 
Annex as being applicable to physical collateral. 
 
 
417  
For example, raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods, or dealers’ inventories of automobiles. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-242  
2.21 
In cases where – 
 
(a)  a Reporting Bank has a registered claim over an obligor’s assets provided 
by a General Security Agreement or other form of floating charge; and 
  
(b) 
the registered claim mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) includes both assets 
that are not eligible as collateral under the F-IRBA, and assets that are 
eligible under the F-IRBA,  
 
a Reporting Bank may recognise the assets that are eligible under the F-IRBA, provided 
that the claims meet the requirements set out in paragraphs 2.13 to 2.20 of this Annex. 
 
2.22 
The Reporting Bank must perform a reassessment of the condition set out in 
paragraph 2.19(f) of this Annex periodically and when information indicates material 
changes in the market. 
 
2.23 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.19(h) of this Annex, where a Reporting Bank 
has recognised ships as eligible physical collateral, the Reporting Bank must ensure that 
the insurance taken out on such assets is assigned to the Reporting Bank. Where a 
Reporting Bank has recognised aircrafts as eligible physical collateral, the Reporting Bank 
must ensure that the insurance taken out on such assets names the Reporting Bank as 
the sole loss payee. 
 
2.24 
A Reporting Bank must treat the CRM of any leased asset that does not expose 
the Reporting Bank to residual value risk, in the same manner as exposures collaterialised 
by the same type of collateral and comply with the minimum requirements for the 
collateral type. In addition to the requirements in paragraph 2.13 of this Annex, a 
Reporting Bank must ensure that all of the following requirements are complied with, 
before it recognises the effects of CRM of any leased asset, where such a leased asset has 
been pledged as collateral in respect of lease payments due to the Reporting Bank as a 
lessor, and on an ongoing basis for as long as it continues, to recognise the effect of CRM 
of any such leased asset:  
 
(a)  the requirements in paragraph 2.14 or 2.19 of this Annex, as the case 
may be, are complied with; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank exercises robust risk management with respect to the 
location of the leased asset, the use to which it is put, its age, and planned 
obsolescence; 
 
(c)  there is a robust legal framework to establish the legal ownership of the 
leased asset by the Reporting Bank and its ability to exercise its rights as 
owner in a timely fashion;  
 
(d)  the difference between the rate of depreciation of the leased asset and 
the rate of amortisation of the lease payments is not so large as to 
overstate the effects of CRM attributed to the leased assets. 
 
2.25 
In addition to the requirements in paragraph 2.13 of this Annex, a Reporting 
Bank must ensure that all of the following requirements are complied with, before it 
recognises the effects of CRM of any collateral for OTC derivative transactions and SFTs 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-243  
and on an ongoing basis for as long as it continues, to recognise the effects of CRM of any 
collateral for OTC derivative transactions and SFTs:  
 
 (a)  a Reporting Bank must ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to the 
orderly operation of margin agreements with counterparties in OTC 
derivative transactions and SFTs, as measured by the timeliness and 
accuracy of its outgoing calls and response time to incoming calls;  
 
 (b)  a Reporting Bank must have collateral management policies in place to 
control, monitor and report – 
 
(i)  the risk to which margin agreements expose them including the 
volatility and liquidity of the securities exchanged as collateral; 
 
(ii)  the concentration risk to particular types of collateral; 
 
(iii)  the reuse of collateral (both cash and non-cash), including the 
potential liquidity shortfalls resulting from the reuse of collateral 
received from counterparties; and 
 
(iv)  the surrender of rights on collateral posted to counterparties. 
 
 
Section 3:  Recognition of collateral for certain non-centrally cleared SFTs 
 
 
Scope 
 
3.1 
Subject to paragraph 3.4 of this Annex, the Reporting Bank must apply the 
haircut floors in this Section to all of the following transactions: 
 
(a)  non-centrally cleared SFTs in which a Reporting Bank provides financing 
(i.e. lends cash) against collateral other than securities issued by –  
 
(i) 
the counterparties referred to in paragraph 7.3.1(b);  
 
(ii) 
a PSE, where such exposure would qualify for a 0% or 20% risk 
weight pursuant to paragraph 7.3.48 and Table 7-3 under the 
SA(CR); or 
 
(iii) a qualifying MDB, 
 
or commodities, to entities which are not supervised by a regulator that 
imposes prudential requirements consistent with international norms; 
 
(b)  collateral upgrade transactions with entities which are not supervised by 
a regulator that imposes prudential requirements consistent with 
international norms.  
 
3.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 3.1(a) and (b) of this Annex, “entity” excludes 
individuals. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-244  
3.3  
For the purposes of paragraph 3.1(b) of this Annex, a collateral upgrade 
transaction is one where a Reporting Bank lends a security to its counterparty and the 
counterparty pledges a lower quality security as collateral, thus allowing the counterparty 
to exchange a lower quality security for a higher quality security. A lower quality security 
refers to one with a higher haircut floor under Table 7H-1 than the security being compared 
to. 
 
3.4 
A Reporting Bank must not apply the haircut floors in this section to SFTs 
where – 
 
(a)  the counterparty is a central bank;  
 
(b)  in the case of an SFT referred to in paragraph 3.1(a) of this Annex –  
 
(i) 
the counterparty lends the security to a Reporting Bank at a specific 
maturity, and reinvests or employs the cash received at the same or 
a shorter maturity, therefore not giving rise to material maturity or 
liquidity mismatch;  
 
(ii) 
the counterparty lends the security to a Reporting Bank at call or at 
a specific maturity, reinvests the cash received into a reinvestment 
fund or account subject to regulations or regulatory guidance 
meeting the minimum standards for reinvestment of cash collateral 
by securites lenders set out in Section 3.1 of “Policy Framework for 
Addressing Shadow Banking Risks in Securities Lending and Repos” 
issued by FSB on 29 August 2013418; or 
 
(c) 
in the case of a collateral upgrade transaction referred to in paragraph 
3.1(b) of this Annex, the counterparty is unable to re-use, or provide 
representations to a Reporting Bank that it does not and will not re-use, 
the security it has received as collateral against the securities lent to the 
Reporting Bank.  
 
3.5 
For the purposes of paragraph 3.4(b)(ii) of this Annex, the Reporting Bank may 
rely on representations by their counterparties that their reinvestment of the cash received 
meets the minimum standards.  
 
3.6 
For the purposes of this Section, “in-scope SFTs” refers to SFTs specified in 
paragraph 3.1 of this Annex, excluding SFTs set out in paragraph 3.4 of this Annex.  
 
 
 
Haircut floors 
 
3.7 
A Reporting Bank must apply the following haircut floors to in-scope SFTs:

“Strengthening oversight and regulation of shadow banking, Policy framework for addressing shadow 
banking risks in securities lending and repos” issued by FSB on 29 August 2013, which is accessible at

Single in-scope SFTs 
 
3.8 
For a single in-scope SFT which is not included in a netting set, a Reporting 
Bank must – 
 
(a) 
determine the haircut, H, and the haircut floor, f, of the SFT transaction 
in accordance with paragraph 3.9 of this Annex;  
 
(b) 
compare the haircut of the transaction, H, with the haircut floor of the 
transaction, f; and 
 
(c) 
where H is smaller than f, treat the in-scope SFT as an unsecured loan to 
the counterparty (i.e. the Reporting Bank must not recognise any effects 
of CRM for the transaction).  
 
3.9 
For the purposes of paragraph 3.8(a) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
determine the haircut, H, and the haircut floor, f, of the SFT transaction as follows: 
 
(a)  in the case of a single SFT where cash is lent by the Reporting Bank for 
collateral419 –  
 
(i) 
H is the fair value of the collateral received by the Reporting Bank in 
excess of the cash lent, expressed as a percentage of the amount of 
cash lent; and  
 
(ii) 
f is the haircut floor applicable to the collateral received by the 
Reporting Bank as set out in Table 7H-1; 
 
 
419  
For example, in the case of an in-scope SFT, where the Reporting Bank lends $100 cash against $101 of a 
corporate debt security with a 12-year maturity, H is (101/100)-1 = 0.01, and f is 0.04. Since H<f, the 
Reporting Bank must treat the in-scope SFT as an unsecured loan of $100 cash to the counterparty. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-246  
(b)  in the case of a single collateral-for-collateral SFT, where a Reporting Bank 
lends collateral A and receives collateral B420 –  
 
(i) 
H is the fair value of the collateral received by the Reporting Bank in 
excess of the fair value of the collateral lent; and  
 
(ii) 
f is computed using the following formula: 
 
𝑓 = [(
1
1 + 𝑓𝐴
) (
1
1 + 𝑓𝐵
)
⁄
] −1 =  
1 + 𝑓𝐵
1 + 𝑓𝐴 
−1 
 
where –  
 
(A)  𝑓𝐴 refers to the haircut floor applicable to collateral A as set out 
in Table 7H-1; and 
 
(B)  𝑓𝐵 refers to the haircut floor applicable to collateral B as set out 
in Table 7H-1. 
 
For the purposes of this paragraph, collateral that is called by either a Reporting Bank or 
its counterparty may be treated as collateral received from the moment that it is called, 
i.e. the treatment is independent of the settlement period. 
 
 
Netting set of SFTs421 
 
3.10 
For a netting set of SFTs, which can comprise SFTs which are in-scope SFTs or 
otherwise, a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
determine the haircut of the portfolio, Hportfolio, and the haircut floor of the 
portfolio, fportfolio, in accordance with paragraph 3.11 of this Annex;  
 
(b) 
compare the haircut of the portfolio, Hportfolio, with the haircut floor of the 
portfolio, fportfolio; and 
 
(c) 
where Hportfolio < fportfolio for a netting set of SFTs422, treat the in-scope SFTs 
within the netting set as unsecured loans to the counterparty in 
accordance with paragraph 3.12 of this Annex.  
 
3.11 
For the purposes of paragraph 3.10(a) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
determine the haircut of the portfolio, Hportfolio, and the haircut floor of the portfolio, fportfolio, 
as follows:  
  
(a) 
Hportfolio is computed using the following formula: 
 
 
420  
For example, in the case of an in-scope SFT where the Reporting Bank lends $102 of a corporate debt 
security with a 10-year maturity, against $104 of a main index equity, H is (104/102)-1 = 0.0196, and f is 
(1.06/1.03)-1 = 0.0291. Since H<f, the Reporting Bank must treat the in-scope SFT as an unsecured loan 
of $102 in the corporate debt security to the counterparty.  
421  
An example on how the SFT haircut floors applies to a hypothetical portfolio is available in Annex 7K. 
422  
The portfolio does not breach the floor where Hportfolio ≥ fportfolio.   


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-247  
𝐻𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑜= 
∑𝐶𝑡−∑𝐸𝑠
∑𝐸𝑠
  
 
(b) 
fportfolio is computed using the following formula, which calculates a 
weighted average floor of the portfolio: 
 
𝑓𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑜= [

1 + 𝑓𝑠
𝑠
∑𝐸𝑠

] −1 
 
 
 
where –  
 
(i)  
𝐸𝑠 refers to the fair value of the net position in each security (or cash) 
that is net lent by the Reporting Bank;  
 
(ii)  𝐶𝑡 refers to the fair value of the net position in each security that is 
net borrowed by the Reporting Bank; and 
 
(iii)  𝑓𝑠 and 𝑓𝑡 refers to the haircut floors applicable to securities that are 
net lent and net borrowed by the Reporting Bank, respectively, as 
set out in Table 7H-1.  
 
For the purposes of this paragraph, collateral that is called by either a Reporting Bank or 
its counterparty may be treated as collateral received from the moment that it is called, 
i.e. the treatment is independent of the settlement period.  
 
3.12 
For the purposes of paragraph 3.10(c) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must – 
  
(a) 
identify the securities within the netting set for which the Reporting Bank 
is a net receiver, and which is listed in Table 7H-1; and 
 
(b) 
treat every in-scope SFT, for which the Reporting Bank is a receiver of one 
of those securities identified in sub-paragraph (a), as an unsecured loan 
(i.e. the Reporting Bank must not recognise any effects of CRM for the 
transaction). 
 
 
Section 4:  Recognition of Guarantees  
 
4.1 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that all of the following requirements are 
complied with, before it recognises the effects of CRM of a guarantee and on an ongoing 
basis for as long as it continues, to recognise the effects of CRM of a guarantee: 
 
(a) 
the guarantee is an explicitly documented obligation assumed by the 
guarantor; 
 
(b) 
the guarantee represents a direct claim on the guarantor;  
 
(c) 
explicitly referenced to specific exposure or pool of exposures so that the 
extent of the credit protection cover is clearly defined and incontrovertible; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-248  
(d) 
other than in the event of non-payment by the Reporting Bank of money 
due in respect of the guarantee, there is an irrevocable obligation on the 
part of the guarantor to pay out a pre-determined amount upon the 
occurrence of a credit event, as defined under the guarantee;  
 
(e) 
the guarantee does not contain any clause that – 
  
(i) 
would allow the guarantor to unilaterally cancel the guarantee, 
unless the guarantee includes a cancellation clause where it is 
provided that any obligation incurred or transaction entered into 
prior to any cancellation, unilateral or otherwise, continues to be 
guaranteed by the guarantor;  
 
(ii) 
would increase the effective cost of the guarantee as a result of 
deteriorating credit quality of the underlying exposure; 
 
(iii) depends on factors outside the direct control of the Reporting Bank 
for its fulfilment, which could prevent the guarantor from being 
obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the underlying 
obligor fails to make any payment due; or 
 
(iv) could allow the maturity of the guarantee agreed ex-ante to be 
reduced ex-post by the guarantor; 
 
(f) 
subject to paragraph 4.2 of this Annex, the Reporting Bank is able in a 
timely manner to pursue the guarantor for any monies outstanding under 
the documentation governing the transaction on the default of, or non-
payment by, the underlying obligor423, and has the right to receive such 
payments from the guarantor without first having to take legal actions to 
pursue the obligor for payment;   
 
(g) 
the guarantee covers all types of payments that the underlying obligor is 
expected to make under the documentation governing the transaction424. 
Where a guarantee covers payment of principal only, a Reporting Bank 
must treat interests and other uncovered payments as an unsecured 
amount in accordance with paragraph 1.2 of Annex 7I . 
  
4.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 4.1(f) of this Annex, for exposures to protection 
providers under the A-IRBA or IRBA for retail asset class, a Reporting Bank may recognise 
the effects of CRM of a guarantee that only covers the loss remaining after the Reporting 
Bank has first pursued the original obligor for payment and has completed the workout 
process. 
 
4.3 
Where a Reporting Bank has an exposure that is protected by a guarantee which 
is counter-guaranteed by a central government or central bank, a Reporting Bank may 
treat the exposure as being protected by a direct guarantee from the central government 
or central bank in question, provided the following requirements are complied with: 
 
423  
The guarantee payments may be in the form of the guarantor making a lump sum payment of all monies 
to the Reporting Bank or the guarantor assuming the future payment obligations of the counterparty 
covered by the guarantee, as specified in the relevant documentation governing the guarantee. 
424  
For example, notional amounts, or margin payments. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-249  
 
(a) 
the counter-guarantee covers all credit risk elements of the exposure; 
 
(b) 
both the original guarantee and the counter-guarantee comply with all the 
requirements for guarantees set out in this Annex, except that the 
counter-guarantee need not be direct and explicit with respect to the 
original exposure;  
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Authority that 
the cover is robust and that there is no evidence to suggest that the 
coverage of the counter-guarantee is less than equivalent in effect to that 
of a direct guarantee from the central government or central bank in 
question. 
 
 
Section 5:  Recognition of Credit Derivatives  
 
 
Types of Credit Derivatives 
 
5.1 
Subject to paragraph 5.2 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank may recognise the 
effects of CRM of only the following types of credit derivatives that provide credit protection 
equivalent to guarantees:  
 
(a)  credit default swaps; 
 
(b)  total return swaps ;  
 
(c)  instruments that are composed of, or are similar in economic substance, 
to one or more of the credit derivatives in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b);  
 
(d)  where a Reporting Bank is using the A-IRBA to calculate the credit risk-
weighted exposure, first-to-default credit derivatives. 
 
5.2 
Despite paragraph 5.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must not recognise the 
effects of CRM for any of the following types of credit derivatives:  
 
(a)  a first-to-default credit derivative where a Reporting Bank is using the 
SA(CR), F-IRBA or the supervisory slotting criteria to calculate the credit 
risk-weighted exposure;  
 
(b)  a nth-to-default credit derivative;  
 
(c)  a total return swap, if the Reporting Bank records the net payments 
received on the total return swap as net income, but does not record 
offsetting deterioration in the value of the underlying asset that is 
protected (either through reductions in its marked-to-market value or by 
an addition to reserves). 
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-250  
 
Requirements for Recognition of Credit Derivatives 
 
5.3 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that all of the following requirements are 
complied with, before it recognises the effects of CRM of any credit derivative and on an 
ongoing basis for as long as it continues, to recognise the effects of CRM of any credit 
derivative: 
 
(a)  the terms and conditions of any credit protection obtained via a credit 
derivative are set out in writing by both the Reporting Bank and the 
provider of credit protection; 
 
(b)  the credit derivative represents a direct claim on the provider of credit 
protection;  
 
(c)  the credit derivative is explicitly referenced to a specific exposure or pool 
of exposures so that the extent of the credit protection cover is clearly 
defined and incontrovertible; 
 
(d)  other than in the event of non-payment by the Reporting Bank of money 
due in respect of the credit derivative, there is an irrevocable obligation 
on the part of the provider of the credit protection to pay out a pre-
determined amount upon the occurrence of a credit event, as defined 
under the credit derivative contract; 
 
(e)  the credit derivative contract does not contain any clause that –  
 
(i) 
would allow the provider of credit protection to unilaterally cancel 
the credit protection cover; 
 
(ii)  would increase the effective cost of the credit protection cover as a 
result of deteriorating credit quality of the underlying exposure; 
 
(iii)  depends on factors outside the direct control of the Reporting Bank 
for its fulfilment, which could prevent the provider of credit 
protection from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the 
event that the underlying obligor fails to make any payment due425; 
or 
 
(iv)  could allow the maturity of the credit protection agreed ex-ante to 
be reduced ex-post by the provider of credit protection;  
 
(f)  the credit events specified by the contracting parties at a minimum cover – 
 
(i)  
failure to pay the amounts due under terms of the underlying 
exposure that are in effect at the time of such failure (with a grace 
period, if any, that is closely in line with the grace period in the 
underlying exposure); 
 
 
425 
This does not preclude an obligation by the buyer of credit protection to satisfy requirements relating to 
providing a Notice of Publicly Available Information, as is the case for the triggering of credit protection 
under standard credit default swap contracts.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-251  
(ii)  bankruptcy, insolvency or inability of the underlying obligor to pay 
its debts, or its failure or admission in writing of its inability generally 
to pay its debts as they become due, and analogous events; and 
 
(iii)  restructuring of the underlying exposure involving forgiveness or 
postponement of principal, interest or fees that results in a credit 
loss event (i.e. write-off, specific allowance or other similar debit to 
the profit and loss account), subject to paragraph 5.4 of this Annex; 
 
(g)  the credit derivative does not terminate prior to the expiration of any grace 
period required for a default on the underlying exposure to occur as a 
result of a failure to pay, or the maturity of the underlying exposure 
subject to Section 7 of this Annex; 
 
(h)  a robust valuation process is in place in order to estimate loss reliably for 
any credit derivative that allows for cash settlement, with a clearly 
specified period for obtaining post-credit event valuations of the 
underlying obligation426; 
 
(i)  
where the right or ability of the Reporting Bank to transfer the underlying 
exposure to the protection provider is required for settlement, the terms 
of the underlying exposure provide that any required consent to such 
transfer may not be unreasonably withheld; 
 
(j)  the identities of the parties responsible for determining whether a credit 
event has occurred are clearly defined and the determination is not the 
sole responsibility of the protection provider. The Reporting Bank has the 
right or ability to inform the protection provider of the occurrence of a 
credit event427;  
 
(k)  the underlying obligation and the reference obligation specified in the 
credit derivative contract for the purposes of determining the cash 
settlement value or the deliverable obligation or for the purposes of 
determining whether a credit event has occurred may be different only if – 
 
(i) 
the reference obligation ranks pari passu with or is junior to the 
underlying obligation; and 
 
(ii) 
the underlying obligation and reference obligation share the same 
obligor (i.e. the same legal entity) and legally enforceable cross-
default or cross-acceleration clauses are in place.  
 
 
 
426 
The Authority would generally consider the cash settlement methodology provided in the ISDA Credit 
Derivatives Definitions as satisfying this requirement. 
427  
A Reporting Bank that has bought credit protection through a credit derivative covered by the 2009 ISDA 
Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees and Auction Settlement CDS Protocol (Big Bang Protocol) 
may recognise the effects of CRM of such a credit derivative, as the Reporting Bank has the right to request 
a ruling from the parties responsible for determining whether a credit event has occurred (“Determinations 
Committee”) and the Determinations Committee is independent from the CRM provider. In this case, the 
requirements in paragraph 5.3(j) of this Annex are fulfilled as the roles and identities of the parties 
responsible for determining the occurrence of a credit event is clearly identified and the determination of a 
credit event is not the sole responsibility of the protection provider. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-252  
5.4 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.3(f)(iii) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank 
hedging exposures to a corporate counterparty may recognise the effects of CRM of a 
credit derivative that does not include restructuring as a credit event provided that –  
 
(a) 
a 100% vote of the creditors of the corporate counterparty is needed to 
amend the maturity, principal, coupon, currency or seniority status of the 
underlying exposure to the corporate counterparty;  
 
(b) 
the legal domicile in which the exposure to the corporate counterparty is 
governed has a well-established bankruptcy code that allows for a 
company to reorganise or restructure and provides for an orderly 
settlement of creditor claims; and 
 
(c) 
all the other requirements in paragraph 5.3 of this Annex are complied 
with. 
 
Where the conditions set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (b) are not met but the condition in 
sub-paragraph (c) is met, the Reporting Bank may recognise the effects of CRM of the 
credit derivative in accordance to paragraph 1.3 of Annex 7I, subject to the requirements 
set out in that paragraph. 
 
 
Section 6:  Currency Mismatches  
 
6.1 
For a Reporting Bank using the FC(CA) where there is a currency mismatch 
between the eligible financial collateral received and the underlying exposure secured by 
the eligible financial collateral, the Reporting Bank must adjust the value of the eligible 
financial collateral based on the standard supervisory haircuts applicable for currency 
mismatch set out in paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5 of Annex 7J. To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank 
using the FC(SA) need not carry out any adjustments where there is a currency mismatch 
between the eligible financial collateral received and the underlying exposure secured by 
the eligible financial collateral. 
 
6.2 
In the case where there is a currency mismatch between the credit protection 
and the underlying exposure, a Reporting Bank must reduce the amount of the exposure 
deemed to be protected by applying a haircut, where – 
 
Protected portion GA  = 
G x (1-HFX) 
 
where – 
 
(a) 
G  
= 
notional amount of the credit protection; and 
 
(b) 
HFX 
= 
haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the 
 
 
credit protection and underlying obligation exposure set 
 
 
at 8%, which is based on a 10-business day holding  
 
 
period, assuming daily mark-to-market. 
 
6.3 
For the purposes of calculating the protection portion GA as set out in paragraph 
6.1 of this Annex, if the credit protection is not marked-to-market daily, a Reporting Bank 
must scale HFX in accordance with paragraph 3.4 of Annex 7J .  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-253  
 
Section 7:  Maturity Mismatches  
 
7.1 
Subject to paragraph 7.2 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank may recognise the 
effects of CRM for an exposure where there is a maturity mismatch only if the credit risk 
mitigant has an original maturity of at least one year and a residual maturity of at least 3 
months. For the purposes of calculating credit RWA, a maturity mismatch occurs when the 
residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is less than that of the underlying exposure.  
 
7.2 
If the credit risk mitigant is an eligible financial collateral, a Reporting Bank 
using the FC(SA) must not recognise the effects of CRM for an exposure where there is a 
maturity mismatch. 
 
7.3 
A Reporting Bank must determine the maturity of the underlying exposure and 
the maturity of the credit risk mitigant conservatively. The Reporting Bank must calculate 
the residual maturity of the underlying exposure as the longest possible remaining time 
before the counterparty is scheduled to fulfil its obligation, taking into account any 
applicable grace period. For the credit risk mitigant, a Reporting Bank must take into 
account options, including embedded options, which may reduce the term of the credit 
protection, so that the shortest possible residual maturity is used428.   
 
7.4 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the value of the credit risk mitigant adjusted 
for any maturity mismatch, PA, using the following formula: 
 
PA  
= 
[P x (t-0.25)]/(T-0.25) 
 
where – 
 
(a) P  
= 
value of the credit risk mitigant429 adjusted for any haircuts; 
 
(b) t  
= 
min (T, residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant) expressed 
in years; and 
 
(c) T  
= 
min (5, residual maturity of the exposure) expressed in years. 
 
 
Section 8:  Residual Risks  
 
8.1 
While a Reporting Bank may reduce or transfer credit risk by using CRM, the 
use of such techniques may simultaneously increase other risks (residual risks). Residual 
risks include legal, operational, liquidity and market risks. Therefore, a Reporting Bank 
must employ robust methods to control these risks, including – 
 
(a) 
strategy;430  
 
 
428  
For example, in the case of a credit derivative, where the protection seller has a call option, the residual 
maturity is the remaining time to the first call date. Likewise, if the protection buyer owns the call option 
and has a strong incentive to exercise the call option at the first call date, for example because of a step-
up in cost from this date on, the residual maturity is the remaining time to the first call date. 
429  
For example, collateral amount, or guarantee amount. 
430  
The Reporting Bank should ensure that a clearly articulated strategy for the use of CRM forms an intrinsic 
part of the general credit strategy of a Reporting Bank. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-254  
(b) 
consideration of the underlying credit;431 
 
(c) 
valuation;432 
 
(d) 
policies and procedures;433 
 
(e) 
systems;434 
 
(f) 
control of roll-off risks;435 and 
 
(g) 
management of concentration risk arising from the use of CRM and the 
interaction of such concentration risk with the overall credit risk profile of 
the Reporting Bank436.  
 
 
431  
Where an exposure is collateralised, the Reporting Bank should ensure that credit managers should 
continue to assess the exposure on the basis of the obligor’s creditworthiness. The Reporting Bank should 
ensure that credit managers should obtain and analyse sufficient financial information to determine the 
obligor’s risk profile and its management and operational capabilities. 
432 
The Reporting Bank should ensure that collateral should be revalued frequently, and the unsecured 
exposure should also be monitored frequently. Frequent revaluation is prudent, and the Reporting Bank 
should ensure that revaluation of marketable securities should occur on at least a daily basis. Furthermore, 
measures of the potential unsecured exposure under collateralised transactions should be calculated under 
stressed and normal conditions. One such measure would take account of the time and cost involved if the 
obligor or counterparty were to default and the collateral had to be liquidated. Furthermore, the Reporting 
Bank should ensure that the setting of limits for collateralised counterparties take account of the potential 
unsecured exposure. The Reporting Bank should ensure that the stress tests and scenario analysis are 
conducted to enable the Reporting Bank to understand the behaviour of its portfolio of collateral 
arrangements under unusual market conditions. The Reporting Bank should ensure that the unusual or 
disproportionate risk identified should be managed and controlled. 
433  
The Reporting Bank should ensure that clear policies and procedures should be established in respect of 
collateral management, including – (a) the terms of collateral agreements; (b) the types of collateral and 
enforcement of collateral terms (e.g. waivers of posting deadlines); (c) the management of legal risks; (d) 
the administration of agreement (e.g. detailed plans for determining default and liquidating collateral); and 
(e) the prompt resolution of disputes, such as valuation of collateral or positions, acceptability of collateral, 
fulfilment of legal obligations and the interpretation of contract terms. 
434  
The Reporting Bank should ensure that its policies and procedures referred to under paragraph 8.1(d) of 
this Annex are supported by collateral management systems capable of tracking the location and status of 
posted collateral (including re-hypothecated collateral), outstanding collateral calls and settlement 
problems. 
435  
Where a Reporting Bank obtains credit protection that differs in maturity from the underlying credit 
exposure, the Reporting Bank should monitor and control its roll-off risks, i.e. the fact that the Reporting 
Bank will be fully exposed when the protection expires, and the risk that it will be unable to purchase credit 
protection or ensure its capital adequacy when the credit protection expires. 
436  
Taking as collateral large quantities of instruments issued by one obligor creates concentration risk. A 
Reporting Bank should have a clearly defined policy with respect to the amount of concentration risk it is 
prepared to run. Such a policy might, for example, include a cap on the amount of collateral it would be 
prepared to take from a particular issuer or market. The Reporting Bank should also take collateral and 
purchased credit protection into account when assessing the potential concentrations in its overall credit 
profile. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

Annex 7I 
 
TREATMENT FOR SPECIFIC TYPES OF CREDIT PROTECTION BOUGHT  
 
 
Proportional Cover 
 
1.1 
Where a Reporting Bank and the protection provider share losses on a pari 
passu and pro rata basis, a Reporting Bank must recognise the eligible credit protection 
on a proportional basis by applying to the protected portion of the exposure the treatment 
applicable to eligible credit protection, and by treating the remainder of the exposure as 
unprotected.  
 
 
 
Principal-only Cover 
 
1.2 
Where the amount guaranteed, or against which an eligible credit protection is 
held, offers principal-only cover, a Reporting Bank must treat the principal amount as the 
protected portion and interest and other uncovered payments as the unprotected portion. 
 
 
Partially Eligible Credit Derivatives  
 
1.3 
Where a Reporting Bank recognises credit protection through a credit derivative 
which meets all the requirements in Annex 7H other than paragraph 5.3(f)(iii) of Annex 
7H, it must treat as the protected portion –  
 
(a)  60% of the amount of the credit derivative; or  
 
(b)  60% of the amount of the underlying exposure,  
 
whichever is lower. 
 
 
Tranched cover for Non-Securitisation Exposures 
 
1.4 
Where a Reporting Bank transfers a portion of the risk of an exposure or a pool 
of exposures in one or more tranches to a protection seller or sellers and the risk 
transferred and the risk retained are of different seniority, the Reporting Bank may 
recognise credit protection for the portion that has been transferred, regardless of whether 
this is a senior tranche437 or a junior tranche438, in accordance with paragraphs 7.6.5 and 
7.6.6.  
 
 
 
 
437  
For example, second loss portion of the securitisation. 
438  
For example, first loss portion of the securitisation. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-256  
 
Tranched Cover for Securitisation Exposures 
 
1.5 
In the case of tranched cover for a securitisation exposure, a Reporting Bank 
must decompose the original securitisation tranche into protected and unprotected sub-
tranches439.  
 
1.6  
Subject to paragraphs 1.8 to 1.11 of this Annex, where a Reporting Bank 
provides tranched cover to a securitisation exposure, it must calculate its capital 
requirement as if it is directly exposed to the particular sub-tranche of the securitisation 
exposure on which it is providing protection, applying the approach as determined by 
paragraphs 7.6.13 to 7.6.19. 
 
1.7 
A Reporting Bank which has bought eligible credit protection must calculate its 
capital requirements for the unprotected and protected sub-tranches separately in the 
following manner:  
 
(a)  subject to paragraphs 1.8 to 1.11 of this Annex, by applying the risk 
weight that is applicable to the unprotected portion, and using the 
approach as determined by paragraphs 7.6.13 to 7.6.19 to calculate the 
credit risk-weighted exposure amount of the unprotected portion;  
 
(b)  by applying the risk weight that is applicable to the eligible protection 
provider to the protected portion to calculate the credit risk-weighted 
exposure amount of the protected portion, and calculating the maturity of 
the protected portion based on the tranche maturity of the securitisation 
exposure calculated in accordance with Section 6 of Annex 7V.  
 
1.8 
If, according to the hierarchy of approaches determined by paragraphs 7.6.13 
to 7.6.19, a Reporting Bank must use the SEC-IRBA or SEC-SA for the original 
securitisation exposure, the Reporting Bank must calculate the parameters A and D 
separately for each of the sub-tranches as if the sub-tranches have been directly issued 
as separate tranches at the inception of the transaction. A Reporting Bank must compute 
the value for KIRB or KSA, as the case may be, on the underlying portfolio of the original 
transaction. 
 
1.9 
If, according to the hierarchy of approaches determined by paragraphs 7.6.13 
to 7.6.19, a Reporting Bank must use the SEC-ERBA or SEC-IAA for the original 
securitisation exposure, the Reporting Bank must calculate the relevant risk weights for 
the different sub-tranches as follows:   
 
(a)  for the sub-tranche of highest priority, the Reporting Bank must use the 
risk weight of the original securitisation exposure;  
 
(b)  for a sub-tranche of lower priority – 
 
(i)  
the Reporting Bank must infer a rating from one of the tranches in 
the original transaction which is subordinated to the original 
securitisation tranche for which tranche protection is being provided. 
 
439     The envisioned decomposition is theoretical and it should not be viewed as a new securitisation transaction. 
The resulting sub-tranches should not be considered resecuritisations solely due to the presence of the 
credit protection. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-257  
The Reporting Bank must then apply the inferred rating to the 
SEC-ERBA to determine the risk weight of the sub-tranche of lower 
priority. The Reporting Bank must compute tranche thickness, T, as 
the thickness of the sub-tranche of lower priority only; or 
 
(ii)  if it is not possible to infer a rating, the Reporting Bank must compute 
the risk weight for the sub-tranche of lower priority using the 
SEC-SA, applying the adjustments to the determination of the 
parameters A and D described in paragraph 1.8 of this Annex. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the risk weight for this sub-tranche 
is the greater of –  
 
(A)  the risk weight determined through the application of the 
SEC-SA with the adjusted A and D points; and 
 
(B)  the SEC-ERBA risk weight of the original securitisation exposure 
before any effects of CRM are recognised. 
 
1.10 
For the purposes of paragraph 1.9(a) of this Annex, ‘sub-tranche of highest 
priority’ only describes the relative priority of the decomposed tranche. The calculation of 
the risk weight of each sub-tranche is independent of whether the sub-tranche is protected 
(i.e. risk is taken by the protection provider) or unprotected (i.e. risk is taken by the 
protection buyer). 
 
1.11 
Under all approaches, a Reporting Bank must treat a lower-priority sub-tranche 
as a non-senior securitisation exposure even if the original securitisation exposure prior to 
protection is a senior securitisation exposure.

Section 1:  Calculation of E* or EAD*  
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank using the FC(CA) must calculate E* (or EAD*), the exposure 
amount adjusted for eligible financial collateral, for any collateralised transaction not 
covered by a qualifying bilateral netting agreement or a qualifying cross-product netting 
agreement other than OTC derivative transactions or long settlement transactions, using 
the following formula:  
 
E*(or EAD*) 
= max {0, [E (or EAD)(1 + HE) - C(1 – HC – HFX)]} 
 
where -  
 
(a)   E* (or EAD*)  
= 
exposure value after credit risk mitigation; 
 
(b)   E (or EAD) 
= 
fair value of the exposure calculated in 
accordance with Division 2 of Part VII; 
 
(c)   HE 
= 
haircut appropriate to the exposure; 
 
(d)   C 
= 
fair value of the eligible financial collateral 
received; 
 
(e)   HC 
= 
haircut appropriate to the collateral, or if 
the collateral is a basket of assets, the 
weighted sum of the haircuts appropriate to 
the assets in the basket where each weight 
is the proportion of the asset in the basket 
in units of currency; and 
 
(f)   HFX 
= 
haircut appropriate for currency mismatch 
between the collateral and exposure. 
 
1.2 
Where there is a maturity mismatch between the eligible financial collateral 
received by a Reporting Bank and the underlying exposure, the Reporting Bank must 
substitute PA calculated in accordance with paragraph 7.4 of Annex 7H for C(1 – HC – HFX). 
 
1.3 
A Reporting Bank using the FC(CA) must calculate E* or EAD*, whichever is 
applicable, for any SFT covered by a qualifying bilateral netting agreement or qualifying 
cross-product netting agreement, using the following formula: 
 
E*(or EAD*) = 
𝑚𝑎𝑥{0; ∑𝐸𝑖

where – 
 
(a) E* (or EAD*) =

(b) Ei (or EADi)  =  
fair value of all cash and collateral lent, sold with an

(d) N 
= 
number of security issues or commodities in the 
netting set, excluding any issue of security or

less than one tenth of the largest security by fair value 
in the netting set; 
 
(e) Efx 
= 
absolute value of the net position in each currency fx 
different from the settlement currency; and 
 
(f) Hfx

1.4 
For the purposes of paragraph 1.3 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
calculate net exposure and gross exposure, using the following formulas respectively: 
 
Net exposure = |∑𝐸𝑆× 𝐻𝑆
𝑆
| 
 
Gross exposure = ∑𝐸𝑆× |𝐻𝑆|
𝑆
 
 
where – 
 
(a) 
ES

(b) 
HS 
= haircut appropriate to ES, and has a positive sign if the 
collateral is lent, sold with an agreement to be 
repurchased, or transacted in a manner similar to either 
a securities lending, commodities lending or a repurchase 
agreement, and a negative sign if the collateral is 
borrowed, purchased with an agreement to be resold, or 
transacted in a manner similar to either a securities 
borrowing,

borrowing 
or 
a 
reverse 
repurchase agreement. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-260  
1.5 
Subject to paragraphs 1.6 to 1.8 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
determine HE, HC, HS and HFX referred to in paragraphs 1.1 to 1.4 of this Annex, in 
accordance with the standard supervisory haircuts in Section 2 of this Annex, applying the 
minimum holding period for the transaction set out in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3 of this Annex. 
 
1.6 
Subject to paragraph 1.7 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank may apply a value of 
zero to HE, HC and HS in the case of a qualifying repo-style transaction with a core market 
participant. 
 
1.7 
A Reporting Bank calculating E* or EAD*, whichever is applicable, in accordance 
with paragraph 1.3 of this Annex, may apply a value of zero to HE, HC and HS, only where 
all transactions in the netting set are qualifying repo-style transactions with a core market 
participant. 
 
1.8 
 
A Reporting Bank may apply a value of zero to HE, HC and Hs in the case of a 
repo-style transaction where both the exposure and collateral are securities issued by the 
Singapore Government, or by other central governments where a value of zero has been 
prescribed by the bank regulatory agency of that country or jurisdiction and exposures to 
the central government of that country or jurisdiction have a credit quality grade of “1” as 
set out in Table 7M-1.

For the purposes of Table 7J-1 – 
  
(a) 
in the case of a debt security issued by a central government or a central

determined based on an issue-specific external credit assessment of the 
debt security and in accordance with paragraph 7.3.30. Where no issue-
specific external credit assessment is available, the Reporting Bank may 
apply the treatment in paragraph 2.3 of Annex 7H; and

weight under the SA(CR) pursuant to paragraph 7.3.48 and Table 
7-3. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

2.3 
Despite paragraph 2.1 of this Annex, the standard supervisory haircut, HE, for 
SFTs in which a Reporting Bank lends, or posts as collateral, instruments that do not 
qualify as eligible financial collateral is 0.30. For collateralised transactions in which a 
Reporting Bank borrows, or receives as collateral, instruments that do not qualify as 
eligible financial collateral, the Reporting Bank must not recognise the effect of CRM of the 
collateral. 
 
2.4 
The standard supervisory haircut, HFX, for currency mismatch where exposure 
and collateral are denominated in different currencies based on a 10-business day holding 
period and daily revaluation is 0.08. 
  
2.5 
Where the minimum holding period set out in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3 of this 
Annex is shorter or longer than 10 business days, or where the frequency of remargining 
or revaluation is longer than that set out in Table 7J-2, the Reporting Bank must adjust 
HE, HC, HFX and HS using the formulae in paragraph 3.4 of this Annex.

Subject to paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 of this Annex, the following table sets out 
the minimum holding periods and remargining or revaluation conditions for the different 
types of transactions:

market conditions440. This does not apply in the case of 
any transitional illiquidity of collateral and OTC derivative 
transactions that reference a new benchmark rate, for up 
to one year after the discontinuation of an old benchmark 
rate. 
 
Stressed market conditions are characterised by the 
absence of continuously active markets where a 
counterparty would, within 2 or fewer business days, 
obtain multiple price quotations that would not move the 
market or represent a price reflecting a market discount. 
 
3.3 
In relation to any quarter (“relevant quarter”), where a Reporting Bank has 
experienced more than 2 margin call disputes on a netting set over the 2 quarters 
immediately preceding the relevant quarter that have lasted longer than the Reporting 
Bank’s estimate of the margin period of risk, the Reporting Bank must use a minimum 
holding period that is twice the level that would apply under paragraph 3.1 or 3.2 of this 
Annex for the relevant quarter and next quarter after the relevant quarter.  
 
3.4 
Where the minimum holding period set out in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3 of this 
Annex is shorter or longer than 10 business days, or when remargining or revaluation 
conditions set out in Table 7J-2 are not fulfilled, a Reporting Bank must calculate the 
applicable haircut using the following formula:  
 
 H = H10√NR+(TM−1)
10
 
 
 
where –  
 
(a)  “H” refers to the haircut; 
 
(b)  “H10” refers to the haircut based on a 10-business day holding period; 
 
(c)  “TM” refers to the minimum holding period for the type of transaction; and 
 
(d)  “NR” refers to the actual number of business days between remargining or 
revaluation, as the case may be. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
440  
Examples of situations where transactions are deemed illiquid for this purpose include, but are not limited 
to, transactions that are not marked daily, and transactions that are subject to specific accounting 
treatment for valuation purposes (e.g. transactions referencing securities whose fair value is determined 
by models with inputs that are not observed in the market).

Annex 7L 
 
DEFINITION OF DEFAULT UNDER THE SA(CR) AND IRBA 
 
 
 
Section 1:  Definition of Default 
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank must record a default on any exposure to a particular obligor 
if –    
 
(a) 
it considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the 
banking group in full, without recourse by the Reporting Bank or any of its 
banking group entities to actions including realising collateral; or  
 
(b)  the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any credit obligation to the 
banking group.  
 
1.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 1.1 of this Annex, for an IRBA exposure, the 
Authority may permit an extension of days past due beyond 90 days for a foreign PSE 
obligor, of up to 180 days, if a Reporting Bank requests such permission and provides 
strong justification for the extension. 
  
1.3 
If the Reporting Bank considers that paragraph 1.1 of this Annex no longer 
applies to a previously defaulted exposure, the Reporting Bank must assign a new obligor 
and facility grade to the exposure using the applicable obligor and facility rating system, 
and where relevant, estimate LGD and EAD as it would for a non-defaulted exposure. 
Should the definition of default in this Annex subsequently be triggered, the Reporting 
Bank must deem a second default to have occurred.  
 
 
Indications of Unlikeliness to Pay in Full 
 
1.4 
A Reporting Bank must consider a default to have occurred with regard to a 
particular obligor if any of the following indicators of default is present:  
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank puts any credit obligation of the obligor on non-
accrued status441; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank makes a write-off or specific allowance resulting from 
a significant perceived decline in credit quality of the obligor subsequent 
to the Reporting Bank taking on any exposure to the obligor442;  
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank sells any credit obligation of the obligor at a material 
credit-related economic loss. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph, the 
Reporting Bank must implement internal policies to determine when a 
 
441  
For example, the Reporting Bank no longer recognises accrued interest as income, or the Reporting Bank 
recognises accrued interest as income and makes an equivalent amount of allowance. 
442 
Specific allowances on equity exposures may be set aside for price risk and do not signal default. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-266  
material credit-related economic loss has been incurred and track the 
performance of such policies over time443;  
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank consents to a distressed restructuring of any credit 
obligation of the obligor (i.e. a restructuring where this is likely to result 
in a diminished financial obligation of the obligation due to the material 
forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest or where relevant, fees), 
including situations where the intention of the restructuring is to 
accommodate a deterioration in the obligor’s financial position or the 
obligor’s inability to meet the original repayment schedule or where the 
revised repayment terms of the credit obligation are of “non-commercial” 
nature, i.e. where the interest rate, fees or repayment period are not what 
would normally be granted by the Reporting Bank to a new obligor of 
similar creditworthiness;  
 
(e) 
the Reporting Bank or any banking group entity has filed for the 
bankruptcy of the obligor or a similar order in respect of any credit 
obligation of the obligor to the banking group; 
 
(f) 
the obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar 
protection which would enable the obligor to avoid or delay repayment of 
any credit obligation to the banking group;  
 
(g) 
any facility to that particular obligor has been accelerated; 
 
(h) 
where the obligor is a bank, merchant bank or finance company, the 
obligor’s authorisation to operate has been revoked444; 
 
(i) 
where the obligor is a central government, there has been an 
announcement of a downgrade to a default rating by a recognised ECAI; 
 
(j) 
a default by the obligor on credit obligations to other financial creditors445 
has occurred based on publicly available information;   
 
(k) 
for an IRBA exposure, the Reporting Bank, in its judgement, deems that 
the default of a related obligor is an indication of default of that particular 
obligor (as described in paragraph 1.8 of this Annex). 
 
1.5 
For the purposes of paragraph 1.4(d) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
implement internal policies on the criteria mentioned in paragraph 1.4(d) of this Annex 
(and any other factors it considers appropriate) and internal procedures to ensure that 
restructured exposures are classified appropriately. 
 
 
443 
These internal policies are examined by the Authority in connection with a Reporting Bank’s application to 
adopt the IRBA. 
444  
This indication of default does not include the voluntary surrender of licenses, for example, in the course 
of a business combination. 
445  
For example, financial institutions or bondholders. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-267  
1.6 
For cases where a Reporting Bank liquidates collateral to satisfy any of the credit 
obligation and does not consider a default to have occurred with regard to the obligor, the 
Reporting Bank must put in place internal processes, independent of the credit risk control 
and origination functions, to review and validate, on a regular basis, that the classification 
of the exposure as a non-default exposure is in accordance with paragraphs 1.1 to 1.5 of 
this Annex. The Reporting Bank must ensure that such internal processes include 
validating that the liquidation of the collateral is not due to a deterioration of the 
creditworthiness of the obligor.446 
 
1.7  
To avoid doubt, for UST exposures, the Reporting Bank need not deem the 
failure of a counterparty to settle a trade, in itself, a default.   
 
 
Related Obligor Default 
 
1.8 
When a default is recorded for any obligor for an IRBA exposure, a Reporting 
Bank must review all ratings of obligors related to that particular obligor to determine if 
that default is an indication that any other related obligor is unlikely to fulfil its 
obligations.447 Where a Reporting Bank rates a group of obligors together as a single 
economic unit, the Reporting Bank must consider a default by any obligor in the group as 
a default by all the obligors in the group. 
 
 
Calculation of Days Past Due for Any Facility 
1.9 
For the purposes of determining whether an obligor is past due more than 90 
days on any credit obligation to the banking group, a Reporting Bank must include all 
components of amounts due, including principal, accrued interest and fees related to the 
credit obligation, in making that determination448 inasmuch as they form part of the return 
that the Reporting Bank receives on the credit risk it underwrites.  
 
1.10 
A Reporting Bank must record a default when – 
 
(a) 
for an overdraft, the approved limit (i.e. advised limit) remains breached 
for more than 90 days, including where the obligor has been advised of a 
limit smaller than current outstandings and the lower limit remains 
breached for more than 90 days;  
 
446 
For example, for certain types of facilities such as securities financing, collateral is liquidated not due to a 
deterioration of the creditworthiness of an obligor but due to a fall in the value of the collateral. For such 
facilities, the collateral may be liquidated to restore an agreed collateral coverage ratio after a fall in the 
value of the collateral, in accordance with the standard practice for facilities of the same type and where 
such practice has been disclosed to the obligor in writing at the inception of the facility. 
447  
The Reporting Bank should ensure that such determination be based on the judgement of the Reporting 
Bank of the degree of economic interdependence and integration between the obligors concerned. There is 
no presumption that related entities would necessarily default together. This would depend on the credit 
judgement of the Reporting Bank expressed in its internal ratings systems. Where the ratings of individual 
obligors in a group are stand-alone ratings or “notched” ratings, a default by any obligor in the group need 
not be considered a default by all the obligors in the group. However, this principle should not override the 
result of any ratings review. 
448 
For example, in the case of corporate exposures, annual facility fees; or in the case of retail exposures, 
annual card fees. To avoid doubt, an obligor is not normally considered by the Authority to be in default 
only by virtue of annual fees payable to the Reporting Bank where the Reporting Bank has already 
commenced steps to reverse or waive such fees. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-268  
 
(b) 
for a corporate exposure which is a revolving loan, an amount is overdue 
for more than 90 days;  
 
(c) 
for a retail exposure which is a revolving loan449, the minimum monthly 
payment is not paid in full by the due date nor within the 90 days 
thereafter, and subsequent minimum monthly payments billed are also 
not paid in full; and  
 
(d) 
for a loan with periodic principal instalments, interest payments, or both, 
an amount due and payable is not paid in full within 90 days of the 
instalment or payment due date.  
 
1.11 
For the purposes of paragraph 1.10(a) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
also have adequate internal policies for assessing the creditworthiness of obligors who are 
offered overdraft accounts. 
 
 
Re-ageing 
 
1.12 
For the purposes of paragraph 1.10 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must have 
clearly articulated and documented policies in respect of the counting of days past due, in 
particular in respect of the re-ageing of the facilities and the granting of extensions, 
deferrals, renewals and rewrites to existing accounts. The Reporting Bank must ensure 
that the policies cover facilities where the Reporting Bank has entered into an agreement 
with the obligor to defer payments or reschedule the due dates that were originally agreed 
upon. 
 
1.13 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the re-ageing policy includes clear 
prescriptions on – 
 
(a) 
the approval authorities and reporting requirements on re-aging;  
 
(b) 
the minimum age of a facility before it is eligible for re-ageing;  
 
(c) 
the delinquency levels of facilities that are eligible for re-ageing;  
 
(d) 
the maximum number of re-ageings per facility; and  
 
(e) 
the associated reassessments of the capacity of the obligor to repay should 
re-aging take place.  
 
1.14 
A Reporting Bank must apply its internal policies on re-aging consistently over 
time, and must ensure that such policies support the ‘use requirements’ under paragraph 
2.7 of Annex 7X. If a Reporting Bank treats a re-aged exposure in a similar fashion to 
exposures which are in default, the Reporting Bank must record this exposure as in default. 
 
1.15 
Except in the case where payments are deferred or the loan is otherwise 
restructured, a Reporting Bank may only re-age when – 
 
449  
For example, credit card. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-269  
 
(a) 
in the case of an overdraft, the outstanding amount is reduced to or below 
the approved limit; 
 
(b) 
in the case of a corporate exposure which is a revolving loan, the amount 
overdue is repaid in full; 
 
(c) 
in the case of a retail exposure which is a revolving loan where an unpaid 
minimum monthly payment is rolled into the following month’s minimum 
payment, the latest minimum monthly payment is paid in full; and 
 
(d) 
in the case of a loan with periodic instalments, interest payments, or both, 
the longest overdue amount is repaid in full, inclusive of accrued interest 
and penalties, in which case the start date of the days past due count is 
then reset to the due date of the remaining instalment or payment that is 
longest overdue.  
 
1.16 
When granting extensions, deferrals, renewals and rewrites, a Reporting Bank 
must consider if these are in fact distressed restructurings under paragraph 1.4(d) of this 
Annex. If so, the Reporting Bank must record a default in respect of the exposure.   
 
 
Treatment of overdrafts 
 
1.17 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that authorised overdrafts are subject to a credit 
limit set by the Reporting Bank and the credit limit is brought to the knowledge of the 
obligor. The Reporting Bank must monitor any break of the credit limit. The Reporting 
Bank must record a default on such overdrafts if the account is not brought under the 
credit limit for more than 90 days. The Reporting Bank must associate non-authorised 
overdrafts with a zero limit. A Reporting Bank must commence counting of days past due 
once any credit is granted to an obligor with a non-authorised overdraft. The Reporting 
Bank must record a default on non-authorised overdrafts if such credit is not repaid for 
more than 90 days. The Reporting Bank must have in place rigorous internal policies for 
assessing the creditworthiness of obligors who are offered overdraft accounts.  
 
 
Section 2:  Exclusion from Obligor-level Application of Definition of Default 
 
2.1 
Despite paragraph 1.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank may, for exposures 
categorised under the SA(CR) regulatory retail, SA(CR) other retail or IRBA retail asset 
classes, apply the definition of default in this Annex at the level of a particular facility, 
rather than at the level of the obligor. Therefore, a default by an obligor on one credit 
obligation does not require a Reporting Bank to treat all other credit obligations of the 
same obligor to the banking group as defaulted.

QUALIFYING REPO-STYLE TRANSACTIONS 
 
 
1.1 
A qualifying repo-style transaction is a repo-style transaction that meets all of 
the following requirements: 
 
(a)   both the exposure and the collateral are cash, or a security issued by an 
entity which would fall within the central government and central bank 
asset class in paragraph 7.3.1(b) or the PSE asset class in paragraph 
7.3.1(c), and qualify for a 0% risk weight under the SA(CR) pursuant to 
paragraphs 7.3.42 to 7.3.49; 
 
(b)   both the exposure and the collateral are denominated in the same 
currency; 
 
(c)   either the transaction is overnight or both the exposure and the collateral 
are marked-to-market daily and are subject to daily remargining; 
 
(d)   following a counterparty’s failure to remargin, the time that is required 
between the last mark-to-market before the failure to remargin and the 
time that the collateral may be liquidated is no more than 4 business days. 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank is not required to liquidate collateral to 
comply with this sub-paragraph, but must have the capability to do so 
within the given time frame; 
 
(e) 
the transaction is settled across a recognised settlement system for that 
type of transaction;  
 
(f) 
the documentation covering the agreement is standard market 
documentation for repo-style transactions in the securities concerned; 
 
(g)   the transaction is governed by documentation specifying that if the 
counterparty fails to satisfy an obligation to deliver cash or securities or 
to deliver margin, or otherwise defaults, then the transaction may be 
terminated immediately; 
 
(h)  upon any event of default, regardless of whether the counterparty is 
insolvent or bankrupt, the Reporting Bank has the unfettered, legally 
enforceable right to immediately seize and liquidate the collateral for the 
benefit of the Reporting Bank.

Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-276  
Annex 7R 
 
DEFINITION OF SL ASSET SUB-CLASS AND HVCRE ASSET SUB-CLASS 
 
 
1.1 
An IRBA exposure belonging to the SL asset sub-class or HVCRE asset sub-class 
possesses all of the following characteristics, either in legal form or economic substance450: 
 
(a) 
the obligor has little or no other material assets or activities, and therefore 
little or no independent capacity to repay the obligation, apart from the 
income that it receives from the asset(s) being financed; 
 
(b) 
the terms of the obligation give the Reporting Bank a substantial degree 
of control over the assets and the income that such assets generate;  
 
(c) 
as a result of the preceding factors, the primary source of repayment of 
the obligation is the income generated by the assets, rather than the 
independent capacity of the broader commercial enterprise of the obligor. 
 
1.2 
The 4 types of exposures within the SL asset sub-class are PF, OF, CF and IPRE 
lending. 
 
 
 
 
Project Finance 
 
1.3 
PF is a method of funding in which the Reporting Bank looks primarily to the 
revenues generated by a single project, both as the source of repayment and as security 
for the exposure. This type of financing is usually for large, complex and expensive 
installations451. PF may take the form of financing of the construction of a new capital 
installation, or refinancing of an existing installation, with or without improvements. 
 
1.4 
In a PF transaction, the Reporting Bank is usually paid solely or almost 
exclusively out of the money generated by the contracts for the facility’s output452. The 
obligor is usually an SPE that is not permitted to perform any function other than 
developing, owning, and operating the installation. The consequence is that repayment 
depends primarily on the project’s cash flow and on the collateral value of the project’s 
assets. In contrast, if repayment of the exposure depends primarily on a contractually 
obligated end-user with adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments in a timely 
manner based on the broader commercial enterprise of the end-user for repayment, it is 
treated as a secured exposure to that end-user. 
 
 
 
 
Object Finance 
 
1.5 
OF refers to a method of funding the acquisition of physical assets453 where the 
repayment of the exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the specific assets 
 
450  
Such an exposure is typically to an entity (including an SPE) which was created specifically to finance or 
operate physical assets or both. 
451  
For example, power plants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment 
infrastructure, or media and telecommunications infrastructure. 
452  
For example, the electricity sold by a power plant. 
453  
For example, ships, aircraft, satellites, railcars, or fleets.

7-277  
that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the Reporting Bank. A primary source 
of these cash flows may be rental or lease contracts with one or several third parties. In 
contrast, if the exposure is to an obligor whose financial condition and debt-servicing 
capacity enables it to repay the debt without undue reliance on the specifically pledged 
assets, the exposure is treated as a collateralised exposure categorised in an asset class 
or asset sub-class other than the specialised lending asset sub-class.  
 
 
 
 
Commodities Finance 
 
1.6 
CF refers to structured short-term lending to finance reserves, inventories, or 
receivables of exchange-traded commodities454, where the exposure will be repaid from 
the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the obligor has no independent capacity to 
repay the exposure. This is the case when the obligor has no other activities and no other 
material assets on its balance sheet. The structured nature of the financing is designed to 
compensate for the weak credit quality of the obligor. The rating of the exposure reflects 
its self-liquidating nature and the skill of the Reporting Bank in structuring the transaction 
rather than the credit quality of the obligor. 
 
1.7 
Such lending can be distinguished from exposures financing the reserves, 
inventories, or receivables of other more diversified corporate obligors, where a Reporting 
Bank is able to rate the credit quality of the latter type of obligors based on the obligors’ 
broader ongoing operations. In such cases, the value of the commodity serves as a credit 
risk mitigant rather than as the primary source of repayment.   
 
 
 
 
IPRE Lending 
 
1.8 
IPRE lending refers to a method of providing funding to real estate455 where the 
prospects for repayment and recovery on the exposure depend primarily on the cash flows 
generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease 
or rental payments or the sale of the asset. The obligor may be, but is not required to be, 
an SPE, an operating company focused on real estate construction or holdings, or an 
operating company with sources of revenue other than real estate. The distinguishing 
characteristic of IPRE lending versus other corporate exposures that are collateralised by 
real estate is the strong positive correlation between the prospects for repayment of the 
exposure and the prospects for recovery in the event of default, with both depending 
primarily on the cash flows generated by a property. 
 
 
 
 
HVCRE Lending 
 
1.9 
HVCRE lending refers to the financing of CRE that exhibits higher loss rate 
volatility (i.e. higher asset correlation) compared to an IRBA exposure belonging to the SL 
asset sub-class. HVCRE includes –  
 
 
454  
For example, crude oil, metals, or crops. 
455  
For example, office building to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse 
space, or hotels. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-278  
(a) 
CRE exposures secured by properties of types that are categorised by the 
Authority as sharing higher volatilities in portfolio default rates;456  
 
(b) 
loans financing any of the ADC phases for properties of those types in 
sub-paragraph (a); and 
 
(c) 
loans financing ADC of any other properties where the source of 
repayment at origination of the exposure is either the future uncertain 
sale of the property or cash flows whose source of repayment is 
substantially uncertain457, unless the obligor has substantial equity at risk. 
The Reporting Bank must not risk-weight commercial ADC loans exempted 
from treatment as HVCRE loans on the basis of certainty of repayment or 
obligor equity using the risk weights specified in paragraph 7.4.128. 
 
1.10 
Where a bank regulatory agency in a foreign country or jurisdiction has 
categorised certain types of CRE exposures as HVCRE in its country or jurisdiction, a 
Reporting Bank must apply the capital treatment in accordance with Sub-division 7 of 
Division 4 of Part VII to such HVCRE exposures in that country or jurisdiction. 
 
 
Case Studies 
 
1.11 
Some case studies on the categorisation of IRBA exposures based on the 
definitions above are as follows458: 
 
 
Project Finance 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank finances an SPE that will build and operate a project. 
The SPE has an off-take contract with an end-user. The length of the 
off-take contract covers the full maturity of the loan, and the loan 
amortises fully during the length of the contract. The payments by the 
end-user to the SPE are based mainly on the ability of the SPE to provide 
the specified output or services and not on the actual demand for the 
output or services. If the contract is terminated, the end-user is normally 
required to purchase the underlying assets at a price related to the market 
value of the unexpired term of the contract. This should be considered as 
an exposure belonging to the general corporate asset sub-class rather 
than the SL asset sub-class. 
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank finances an SPE that will build and operate a project. If 
the Reporting Bank is exposed to the key risks in the project – construction 
risk (the risk that the project will not be completed in a timely or cost-
effective manner), operational or technology risk (the risk that the project 
will not operate up to specifications), or market/price risk (the risk that 
 
456 
The Authority has not categorised any type of CRE exposures as HVCRE. Where the Authority categorises 
any type of CRE exposures as HVCRE, the Authority will make public any such determinations. 
457  
For example, the property has not yet been leased to the occupancy rate prevailing in that geographic 
market for that type of CRE. 
458  
The examples are for illustrative purposes only and not intended to be definitive or exhaustive. The actual 
operation of the principles embodied in paragraphs 1.1 to 1.10 of this Annex may vary depending on the 
circumstances in each case. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-279  
the demand and the price of the output will fall or that the margin between 
output prices and input prices and production costs will deteriorate), the 
project should be categorised within the SL asset sub-class. If a circular 
relationship exists between the financial strength of the end-user and the 
project, the project should be categorised under the SL asset sub-class. 
This would be the case when an end-user has limited resources or capacity 
to generate revenues apart from those generated by the project being 
financed, so that the ability of the end-user to honour its off-take contract 
depends primarily on the performance of the project.  
 
(c) 
If a Reporting Bank provides a loan to finance a transatlantic fibre optic 
cable to an established telecommunications firm, which has an established 
business plan, track record and diversified revenue stream, the exposure 
would be considered as belonging to the general corporate asset sub-class. 
 
 
Object Finance 
 
(d) 
A recently established charter airline finances the purchase of 2 aircraft. 
The airline does not have an established record of financial or operational 
performance, and a Reporting Bank would not normally extend long-term 
credit to the airline. An SPE owns the aircraft and leases it to the airline. 
The legal structure of the transaction is such that the Reporting Bank, in 
the event of default, can seize and re-market the aircraft without delay. 
Such a loan would be assigned to the SL asset sub-class given that the 
ability of the obligor to service the loan is unproven and the credit decision 
of the Reporting Bank is largely based on its ability to re-market the 
collateral in the event of default by the obligor. In this case, the asset-
based focus is supported by a loan structure that supports this premise459. 
 
(e) 
A charter airline with an established business plan, many aircraft, and 
diversified service routes, finances the purchase of additional aircraft to 
be used in its own operations. The airline establishes an SPE to own the 
subject aircraft. The Reporting Bank lends to the SPE and takes a security 
interest in the aircraft. The SPE enters into a long-term lease with the 
airline. The term of the lease exceeds that of the underlying loan. The 
lease cannot be terminated under any condition. This exposure would be 
placed in the general corporate asset sub-class because the repayment of 
the loan depends on the overall operations of the airline and is not unduly 
dependent upon the specific aircraft as the primary source of repayment. 
 
(f) 
Same as in sub-paragraph (e), except that (i) the lease term can be 
cancelled by the airline without penalty at some time before the end of 
the loan term, or (ii) even if the lease is non-cancellable, the lease 
payments do not fully cover the aggregate loan payments over the life of 
the loan. This loan should be categorised within the SL asset sub-class, 
given that the airline/lessee is not fully committed to a lease sufficient to 
repay the loan, so pass-through treatment is inappropriate. 
 
459  
For example, where the amortisation schedule mirrors the anticipated depreciation of the aircraft’s fair 
value, where the Reporting Bank has the right to quickly gain control of the aircraft in the event of default 
or bankruptcy, or where the Reporting Bank has control over the airline’s lease payments. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-280  
 
(g) 
A large, well-established shipping company sets up an SPE as a subsidiary. 
There is no contractual recourse between the shipping company and the 
SPE. The SPE wishes to finance a container ship, and the income from 
container shipping (either by the SPE leasing the ship to third parties or 
doing the shipping itself) serves as the sole repayment source for the loan. 
Such a loan would be categorised within the SL asset sub-class because 
the primary source of repayment is the container ship and its income 
generating ability. A Reporting Bank’s ability to base the transaction’s 
rating on the shipping company’s financial capacity is hampered, given 
that the shipping company is not contractually obligated to repay the debt 
or make payments to the SPE sufficient to repay the debt. Instead, the 
loan is structured so that the cash flow from the specified asset, and not 
the general financial capacity of the shipping company, serves as the 
primary source of repayment. 
 
 
Commodities Finance 
 
(h)  A Reporting Bank extends short-term documentary trade credit to a small 
independent trading company (“trader”) that acts as an intermediary 
between producers and their customers. The trader specialises in a single 
commodity and a single region. Each commodity shipment handled by the 
trader is financed and secured separately. Credit is extended upon delivery 
of the commodity to the trader, who has already contracted for the resale 
of the commodity shipment. A trustworthy third party controls the 
shipment of the commodity, and the Reporting Bank controls payment by 
the customer. This loan would be categorised as an exposure in the SL 
asset sub-class, since repayment depends primarily on the proceeds of 
the sale of the commodity. 
 
(i) 
A Reporting Bank extends short-term documentary trade credit to a 
trader. The circumstances are the same as in the preceding case, except 
that the trader has not yet contracted for the resale of the commodity. In 
deciding whether to classify a particular commodities finance transaction 
as an exposure in the SL asset sub-class, the Reporting Bank should, 
among other things, consider the degree of control that it has over the 
commodities and whether the trader has any independent capacity to 
repay the loan other than through the proceeds from the resale of the 
commodities. Where the trader has not contracted for resale of the 
commodities because it has other possible means of repaying its 
obligations, despite the degree of control the Reporting Bank has over the 
commodities, the transaction would not qualify as an exposure in the SL 
asset sub-class. This loan would instead be categorised as an exposure in 
the general corporate asset sub-class since the Reporting Bank’s credit 
exposure is primarily to the trader that is long the commodity. 
 
 (j)  A Reporting Bank provides an unsecured non-transactional working capital 
loan to a small trader, either separately or as part of a transactional credit 
facility. Such an unsecured loan would be categorised within the general 
corporate asset sub-class, since its repayment depends on the trader

7-281  
rather than on the revenues generated by the sale of any specific 
commodity shipment being financed. 
 
 
IPRE Lending 
 
(k) 
A Reporting Bank makes a loan to an SPE to finance the construction of 
an office building that will be let out to prospective tenants. The SPE has 
essentially no other assets and has been created just to manage this office 
building. The office building is pledged as collateral on the loan. This loan 
should be categorised with the SL asset sub-class, given that the prospects 
for repayment and recovery depend primarily on the cash flow generated 
by the asset. 
 
(l) 
A Reporting Bank makes a loan to a large, well-diversified operating 
company to finance the construction of an office building that will be 
primarily occupied by the company. The office building is pledged as 
collateral on the loan, and the loan is a general obligation of the company. 
The loan is small relative to the overall assets and debt service capacity 
of the company. This loan should be categorised as an exposure within 
the general corporate asset sub-class since repayment depends primarily 
on the overall condition of the operating company, which does not in turn 
depend significantly on the cash flow generated by the asset. 
 
(m) A Reporting Bank makes a loan to a company to finance the construction 
or acquisition of an office building that will be let out to prospective tenants. 
The office building is pledged as collateral on the loan, and the loan is a 
general obligation of the company. The company has essentially no other 
assets. The Reporting Bank underwrites the loan using its corporate 
procedures. Despite the fact that the obligor is an operating company and 
the Reporting Bank uses its corporate underwriting procedures, this loan 
should be categorised within the SL asset sub-class. The motivation is that 
the prospects for repayment and recovery both depend primarily on the 
cash flow generated by the asset. Although there is legal recourse to the 
project sponsor, which is an operating company, the overall condition of 
the project sponsor depends primarily on the cash flow generated by the 
asset. Therefore, in the event of project failure, the sponsor will have 
essentially no ability to meet its general obligations. 
 
(n) 
A Reporting Bank makes a loan to an SPE to finance the acquisition of an 
office building that will be primarily leased to a large, well-diversified 
operating company under a long-term lease. The SPE has essentially no 
other assets and has been created just to manage this office building. The 
lease is at least as long as the loan term and is non-cancellable, and the 
lease payments completely cover the cash flow needs of the obligor460. 
The loan is amortised fully over the term of the lease with no bullet or 
balloon payment at maturity. In categorising this loan, the Reporting Bank 
may look through the SPE to the long-term tenant, treating it as an 
exposure within the general corporate asset sub-class. This is because the 
prospects for repayment and recovery depend primarily on the overall 
 
460  
For example, debt service, capital expenditures, or operating expenses.

condition of the long-term tenant, which will determine the cash flow 
generated by the asset. 
 
(o) 
Same as in sub-paragraph (n), except that (i) the lease term can be 
cancelled at some time before the end of the loan term, or (ii) even if the 
lease is non-cancellable, the lease payments do not fully cover the 
aggregate loan payments over the life of the loan. This loan should be 
categorised in the SL asset sub-class. This is because the tenant is not 
fully committed to the lease sufficient to repay the loan, so pass-through 
treatment is inappropriate.

The requirements in this Annex apply to a Reporting Bank which intends to use 
the top-down approach to calculate any of the following: 
 
(a) 
Kdf,cp and Kdf,sp for purchased corporate receivables and purchased 
corporate small business receivables respectively;  
 
(b) 
Kdil,cp ,Kdil,sp  and Kdil,rp, for purchased corporate receivables, purchased 
corporate small business receivables and purchased retail receivables 
respectively. 
 
1.2 
A Reporting Bank must assign the purchased receivables which meet the 
conditions in paragraph 7.4.98(a) to (e) into sufficiently homogeneous pools so that 
accurate and consistent estimates of PD and LGD (or EL) for default losses and estimates 
of EL for dilution losses can be determined. 
 
1.3 
For the purposes of paragraph 1.2 of this Annex, the Reporting Bank must 
reflect the seller’s underwriting practices and the heterogeneity of the customers of the 
seller in the assignment of purchased receivables which meet the conditions in paragraph 
7.4.98(a) to (e). 
 
1.4 
Despite paragraph 2.13 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the 
methods and data used to derive estimates of PD, LGD and EL under the top-down 
approach complies with the requirements in Section 5 of Annex 7X461. In particular, the 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the parameterisation process incorporates all relevant 
information available to the Reporting Bank regarding the quality of the underlying 
purchased receivables and data for similar pools provided by the seller, the Reporting Bank 
or by external sources. A Reporting Bank must determine if the data462 provided by the 
seller is consistent with expectations agreed upon by both the Reporting Bank and the 
seller463.  
 
Section 2:  Operational Requirements and Guidelines 
 
2.1 
A Reporting Bank which has purchased receivables must demonstrate that 
current and future advances can be repaid from the liquidation of or collections against 
the receivables pool. A Reporting Bank must not qualify for the top-down approach unless 
it monitors closely and controls the receivable pool and the overall lending relationship. 
The Reporting Bank must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority its compliance 
with the requirements stated in paragraphs 2.2 to 2.9 of this Annex. 
 
 
 
461  
A Reporting Bank should also ensure that the method used to derive estimates of PD, LGD, and EL under 
the top-down approach meets the guidelines in Section 5 of Annex 7X and Annex 7Z. 
462  
For example, data concerning the type, volume and on-going quality of receivables purchased. 
463  
If this is not the case, the Reporting Bank should obtain and rely upon more relevant data.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore

Legal Certainty  
 
2.2 
The Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the structure of the facility is such 
that it has effective ownership and control of all cash remittances from the receivables 
under all foreseeable circumstances, including incidences of seller or servicer distress and 
bankruptcy.  
 
2.3 
In instances where the obligor of the purchased receivables makes payments 
directly to a seller or a servicer, a Reporting Bank must verify regularly that payments are 
forwarded completely and in accordance to the contractually agreed terms.  
 
2.4 
A Reporting Bank must have procedures in place to ensure that ownership over 
the purchased receivables and cash receipts are protected against bankruptcy stays or 
legal challenges that could materially delay the ability of the seller to liquidate or assign 
the receivables or retain control over cash receipts. 
 
 
Monitoring Systems  
 
2.5 
A Reporting Bank must monitor both the quality of the purchased receivables 
and the financial condition of the seller and servicer. In particular, a Reporting Bank must 
– 
 
(a) 
assess the correlation among the quality of the purchased receivables and 
the financial condition of both the seller and servicer; 
 
(b) 
put in place policies and procedures that provide adequate safeguards to  
protect against such contingencies, including the assignment of an internal 
risk rating for each seller and servicer;  
 
(c) 
have clear and effective policies and procedures for determining seller and 
servicer eligibility, which must include the conduct of periodic reviews of 
sellers and servicers, which findings must be documented, in order to 
verify the accuracy of reports from the seller or servicer, to detect fraud 
or any operational weaknesses and to verify the quality of the credit 
policies of the seller and the collection policies and procedures of the 
servicer;  
 
(d) 
assess the characteristics of the receivables pool including – 
 
(i) 
over-advances; 
 
(ii) 
history of the seller’s arrears, bad debts and bad debt allowances; 
 
(iii)  payment terms; and 
 
(iv)  potential contra accounts; 
 
(e) 
have effective policies and procedures for monitoring on an aggregate 
basis concentrations both within and across receivable pools of single 
obligors of purchased receivables; and 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-307 
(f) 
receive timely and sufficiently detailed reports of receivables ageings and 
dilutions to – 
 
(i) 
ensure compliance with the Reporting Bank’s eligibility criteria and 
advancing policies governing purchased receivables; and  
 
(ii) 
provide an effective means with which to monitor and confirm the 
seller’s terms of sale464 and dilution. 
 
 
Work-Out Systems 
 
2.6 
A Reporting Bank must have systems and procedures for detecting deterioration 
in the financial condition of the seller and deterioration in the quality of the receivables at 
an early stage, and for addressing emerging problems proactively.  
 
2.7 
In addition, a Reporting Bank must have clear and effective policies, procedures 
and where applicable, information systems to – 
 
(a) 
monitor compliance with – 
 
(i)  
all contractual terms of the facility (including covenants, advancing 
formulas, concentration limits, early amortisation triggers etc.); and  
 
(ii)  internal policies governing advance rates and receivables eligibility; 
 
in order to track covenant violations and waivers, and exceptions to 
established policies and procedures; 
 
(b) 
detect, approve, monitor and correct over-advances so as to limit 
inappropriate draws; and 
 
(c) 
address situations regarding financially weakened sellers or servicers and 
deterioration in the quality of receivable pools.465 
 
 
Systems for Controlling Collateral, Credit Availability and Cash  
 
2.8 
A Reporting Bank must have clear and effective policies and procedures 
governing the control of purchased receivables, credit availability and cash. In particular, 
a Reporting Bank must have – 
 
(a) 
written internal policies that specify all material elements 466  of the 
receivables purchase programme, (including advancing rates, eligible 
 
464  
For example, invoice date ageing. 
465  
These may include – 
(a) early termination triggers in revolving loans and other covenant protections; 
(b) a structured and disciplined approach to dealing with covenant violations; and 
(c) clear and effective policies and procedures for initiating legal actions and dealing with problem 
purchased receivables. 
466  
These elements should take into account all relevant and material factors, including the financial condition 
of the seller and servicer, risk concentrations, and trends in the quality of the purchased receivables and 
the customer base of the seller. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-308 
collateral, necessary documentation, concentration limits, and how cash 
receipts are to be handled); and 
 
(b) 
internal systems to ensure that funds are advanced only against specified 
supporting collateral and documentation467. 
 
 
Compliance with Internal Policies and Procedures 
 
2.9 
A Reporting Bank must have an internal process for assessing compliance with 
all internal policies and procedures, which must include – 
 
(a)  regular internal and external audits of all critical phases of the receivables 
purchase programme of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(b)  verification of the separation of duties between – 
 
(i)  
the assessment of the seller and servicer and the assessment of the 
obligor; 
 
(ii)  the assessment of the seller and servicer and the field audit of the 
seller and servicer; and 
 
(c) 
evaluations of back office operations, with particular focus on 
qualifications, experience, staffing levels and supporting systems. 
 
 
Calculation of Capital Requirements for Default Risk, Kdf,cp  and Kdf,sp  using the 
top-down approach 
 
2.10 
For each pool of qualifying corporate purchased receivables and corporate small 
business purchased receivables, the Reporting Bank must estimate the one-year EL arising 
from default risk expressed as a percentage of the total EAD arising from the receivables 
in the relevant pool. The Reporting Bank must calculate the estimate without regard to 
any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties. 
 
2.11 
With the estimated EL for each pool, a Reporting Bank must calculate Kdf,cp  
using the formula in paragraph 7.4.62 or 7.4.63 as appropriate, and Kdf,sp  using the 
formula in paragraph 7.4.65 or 7.4.66 as appropriate, subject to all of the following: 
 
(a)  where the Reporting Bank uses the formula in paragraph 7.4.65, the 
Reporting Bank must calculate S as the weighted average by individual 
exposures of the pool of purchased receivables;  
 
(b) 
where a Reporting Bank does not have the information to calculate the 
average size of the pool, the Reporting Bank must calculate Kdf,sp using 
the formula in paragraph 7.4.62.  
 
2.12 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.11 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank adopting 
the F-IRBA for its general corporate asset sub-class or corporate small business asset sub-
 
467  
For example, servicer attestations, invoices, or shipping documents. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-309 
class must calculate Kdf,cp and Kdf,sp, respectively, with the following as inputs into the 
formulae: 
 
(a)  if the Reporting Bank is unable to decompose its EL estimate into its PD 
and LGD components in a reliable manner, but it is able to demonstrate 
that the exposures are exclusively senior claims to corporate obligors, it 
must determine PD, LGD and EAD as follows: 
 
(i)  
LGD = 
0.40;  
 
(ii)  PD 
= 
EL/LGD;  
 
(iii)  EAD = 
EAD calculated in accordance with Division 2 of Part VII −  
 
 
Kdil; 
 
(b)  if the Reporting Bank is unable to decompose its EL estimate into its PD 
and LGD components in a reliable manner, and it is unable to demonstrate 
that the exposures are exclusively senior claims to corporate obligors, it 
must determine PD, LGD and EAD as follows: 
 
(i)  
LGD = 
1.00; 
 
(ii)  PD 
= 
EL;  
 
(iii)  EAD = 
EAD calculated in accordance with Division 2 of Part VII −
 
 
Kdil;  
 
(c)  if the Reporting Bank is able to estimate PD in accordance with Annex 7X 
in a reliable manner, it must calculate Kdf using the F-IRBA pursuant to 
paragraphs 7.4.62 to 7.4.79, 7.4.81, 7.4.109, and 7.4.111 to 7.4.114, 
where applicable. 
 
2.13 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.11 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank adopting 
the A-IRBA for its general corporate asset sub-class or corporate small business asset sub-
class must calculate Kdf,cp and Kdf,sp, respectively, with the following as inputs into the 
formulae: 
 
(a) 
if the Reporting Bank is able to estimate PD in a reliable manner, it must 
determine PD, LGD and EAD as follows: 
 
(i)  
PD 
= 
PD estimated in accordance with Annex 7X; 
 
(ii) 
LGD = 
EL/PD, subject to a floor equal to the long-run default- 
 
 
 
weighted average loss rate given default;  
 
(iii)  EAD = 
EAD calculated in accordance with Division 2 of Part VII – 
 
 
Kdil;  
 
(b) 
if the Reporting Bank is able to estimate LGD in a reliable manner, it must 
determine PD, LGD and EAD as follows: 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-310 
(i)  
LGD = 
LGD estimated in accordance with Annex 7X, subject to a 
 
 
floor equal to the long-run default-weighted average loss 
 
 
rate given default; 
 
(ii)  PD 
= 
EL/LGD;  
 
(iii)  EAD = 
EAD calculated in accordance with Division 2 of Part VII − 
 
 
Kdil. 
 
2.14 
For the purposes of paragraphs 2.12 and 2.13 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank 
must calculate EAD for a purchase facility which is a revolving loan as follows: 
 
EAD  =  current amount of receivables purchased + (0.4 x undrawn  
 
  
purchase commitment) − Kdil. 
 
2.15 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.13 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
calculate M as follows: 
 
(a) 
for drawn amounts, M = the pool’s exposure-weighted average effective 
M as determined in Annex 7V; 
 
(b) 
for undrawn amounts where the facility contains covenants, early 
amortisation triggers, or other features that protect the Reporting Bank 
against a significant deterioration in the quality of the future receivables 
it is required to purchase over the facility’s term , M = the pool’s exposure-
weighted average effective M as determined in Annex 7V;  
 
(c) 
for undrawn amounts where the facility does not contain such effective 
protections, M = longest-dated potential receivable under the purchase 
agreement + remaining maturity of the purchase facility.

Annex 7U 
 
DEFINITION OF IRBA PARAMETERS 
 
 
Section 1:  Introduction 
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank must derive estimates of PD, and where relevant LGD and 
EAD, that are consistent with the definitions under Sections 2, 3 and 4 of this Annex as 
inputs to the IRBA risk weight functions in Division 4 of Part VII.   
 
1.2 
A Reporting Bank must calculate M in accordance with Annex 7V as an input to 
the IRBA risk weight functions for the IRBA wholesale asset class under Division 4 of  
Part VII.  
 
 
Section 2:  Definition of PD  
 
2.1 
For the IRBA wholesale asset class, the PD attached to any particular obligor 
grade is a statistic that measures the long-run average of one-year default rates for 
obligors in that grade. A Reporting Bank must calculate PD in accordance with the following 
formula468:    
 
PDt = Dt/Nt   
 
 
where –  
 
(a)  “PDt” refers to the probability of default over one year for a particular 
obligor grade; 
 
(b) 
“Nt” refers to the total number of obligors assigned to that obligor grade 
at the beginning of year t, i.e. the obligor grade cohort; and 
 
(c) 
“Dt” is the number of defaults observed for the obligor grade cohort over 
year t. 
 
2.2 
For the IRBA retail asset class, the PD attached to any particular pool of 
exposures is a statistic that measures the long-run average of one-year default rates for 
obligors in that pool. A Reporting Bank must calculate PD in accordance with the formula 
in paragraph 2.1 of this Annex, with “obligor grade” in paragraph 2.1 of this Annex read 
as “pool of exposures”.  
 
  
 
 
468  
A Reporting Bank should assess the effects of all of the following events when calculating historical 
outcomes and deriving forward-looking estimates of PDt for any obligor grade: 
(a) withdrawals of obligors from the obligor grade cohort over a one-year horizon; 
(b) addition of obligors to that particular obligor grade cohort during the one-year horizon and defaults of 
such obligors within the same one-year horizon. 
If the effects are material, the Reporting Bank should take them into account when estimating PDt. This 
may entail modifying the formula for calculating PDt under paragraph 2.1 of this Annex, or using other 
methods to account for the bias in the Reporting Bank’s PD estimate arising from an unequal distribution 
of such events. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-312 
 
Section 3:  Definition of LGD 
 
3.1 
The LGD attached to any particular facility grade or retail pool of exposures is 
a statistic that measures the long-run rate of economic loss, as specified in paragraph 5.6 
of Annex 7X, associated with any facility grade or retail pool of exposures should a default 
occur, and is measured as a percentage of the EAD. 
 
 
Section 4:  Definition of EAD 
 
4.1 
The EAD for an on-balance sheet asset or off-balance sheet item is defined as 
the expected gross exposure of the facility upon default of the obligor. A Reporting Bank 
must estimate EAD in accordance with the requirements under Division 2 of Part VII.

Annex 7V 
 
CALCULATION OF M 
 
 
Section 1:  Calculation of M for IRBA Wholesale Asset Class  
 
1.1 
Subject to paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 of this Annex, and Sections 2 to 5 of this 
Annex, a Reporting Bank adopting the F-IRBA or A-IRBA for an exposure that falls within 
the IRBA wholesale asset class, must calculate the M in years for that exposure based on 
the contractual cash flow schedule for that exposure in accordance with the following 
formula:  
 



M
  
 
where “CFt” denotes the cash flows (including principal, interest payments and 
fees) contractually payable by the obligor in period t, subject to the following: 
 
(a) 
M must be no greater than 5 years;  
 
(b) 
M must be no lower than one year.     
 
1.2 
For an exposure to a revolving loan, a Reporting Bank must determine M using 
the maximum contractual termination date of the facility. The Reporting Bank must not 
use the repayment date of the current drawn amounts to calculate M.  
 
1.3 
A Reporting Bank may cap M at one year for each netting set for which the 
Reporting Bank calculates CVA RWA under either the BA-CVA or the SA-CVA.  
 
 
Section 2:  Calculation of M for CCR Exposures Covered by Qualifying Bilateral 
Netting Agreements 
 
2.1 
Subject to paragraph 2.2 of this Annex, and Sections 3 to 5 of this Annex, a 
Reporting Bank adopting the F-IRBA or A-IRBA for any CCR exposures that fall within the 
IRBA wholesale asset class and that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting agreement, 
must calculate the M in years for all the transactions to a single counterparty as follows:  
 
(a) 
calculate Mi in years, which is the M for each transaction with the 
counterparty in accordance with paragraph 1.1 of this Annex;  
  
(b) 
calculate M in accordance with the following formula:  
 


where “Ni” denotes the notional amount of each transaction and N denotes 
the notional amount of all the transactions covered by the qualifying 
bilateral netting agreement.  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-314 
2.2 
A Reporting Bank may cap M at one year for each netting set for which the 
Reporting Bank calculates CVA RWA under either the BA-CVA or the SA-CVA.  
 
 
Section 3:  Calculation of M for CCR Internal Models Method where the Original 
Maturity of the Longest-Dated Contract Exceeds One Year 
 
3.1 
Subject to paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 of this Annex and Section 5 of this Annex, a 
Reporting Bank using the CCR internal models method must calculate the M for netting 
sets in which the original maturity of the longest-dated contract within the set is greater 
than one year as follows:

3.2 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that M calculated in accordance with paragraph 
3.1 of this Annex is no greater than 5 years and no lower than one year. 
 
3.3 
A Reporting Bank may cap M at one year for each netting set for which the 
Reporting Bank calculates CVA RWA under either the BA-CVA or the SA-CVA.  
 
 
Section 4:  Calculation of M for Short-term Exposures 
 
4.1 
Despite paragraphs 1.1 and 2.1 of this Annex and subject to paragraphs 4.4, 
4.5 and 5.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank adopting the CCR internal models method, or 
the F-IRBA or A-IRBA for a short-term exposure that falls within the IRBA wholesale asset 
class, must calculate M in years for that exposure in accordance with the formula in 
paragraph 1.1 of this Annex, except that M must be at least one day and the requirement 
that M must be no lower than one year does not apply.  
 
4.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 4.1 of this Annex, a short-term exposure means 
–  
(a) 
any self-liquidating trade transaction, including any issued or confirmed 
letter of credit, that has an original maturity of less than one year; or 
 
(b) 
any one of the following exposures that is transaction-oriented, has an 
original maturity of less than one year and does not form part of the 
ongoing financing of an obligor by a Reporting Bank:  
 
469  
The formula adjusts M to reflect rollover risk by replacing EE with effective EE for forecasting horizons 
under one year. Rollover risk is the amount by which EPE is understated when future transactions with a 
counterparty are expected to be conducted on an ongoing basis, but the additional exposure generated by 
the future transactions is not included in calculation of EPE. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-315 
 
(i) 
any OTC derivative transaction and margin lending transaction;  
 
(ii)  any repo-style transaction; 
 
(iii) any short-term loan and deposit, including any negotiable 
certificates of deposit; 
 
(iv)   any exposure arising from settling the purchase and sale of securities, 
including any overdraft arising from failed securities settlements 
provided that such an overdraft does not continue for more than 5  
business days; 
 
(v) 
any exposure arising from cash settlements by wire transfer, 
including any overdraft arising from failed transfers provided that 
such an overdraft does not continue for more than 5 business days;  
 
(vi) any exposure to banks, merchant banks and finance companies 
arising from foreign exchange or money market transactions;  
 
(vii) any exposure to central governments and central banks that are 
denominated and funded in the local currency of that country or 
jurisdiction.  
 
4.3 
For transactions referred to in paragraph 4.2(b)(i) and (ii) of this Annex, the 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the documentation applicable to the exposure requires 
daily remargining and daily revaluation and provides for the prompt liquidation or setoff 
of collateral in the event of default or failure to remargin. 
 
4.4 
For the purposes of paragraph 4.1 of this Annex, for a short-term exposure 
falling within paragraph 4.2(a) of this Annex which is an import or export letter of credit 
or a similar transaction, a Reporting Bank must calculate M in years for that exposure 
based on the remaining maturity of the transaction, subject to M being at least one day. 
 
4.5 
Despite paragraphs 2.1 and 4.1 of this Annex and subject to Section 5 of this 
Annex, a Reporting Bank adopting the F-IRBA or A-IRBA for an OTC derivative transaction, 
margin lending transaction or repo-style transaction that qualifies as a short-term 
exposure as defined in paragraph 4.2 of this Annex, falls within the IRBA wholesale asset 
class and is subject to a qualifying bilateral netting agreement or a qualifying cross-product 
netting agreement must calculate the M in years for all the transactions to a single 
counterparty as follows:  
 
(a) 
calculate Mi in years, which is the M for each transaction subject to a 
qualifying bilateral netting agreement or a qualifying cross-product netting 
agreement with the counterparty in accordance with paragraph 4.1 of this 
Annex; and 
 
(b)  calculate M in accordance with the following formula:

(ii)  “N” refers to the notional amount of all the transactions covered by 
the qualifying bilateral netting agreement or qualifying cross-product 
netting agreement; and 
 
(iii) “M” is subject to a floor equal to the minimum holding period for the 
transaction type set out in Table 7J-2, or where there is more than 
one transaction type, a floor equal to the highest holding period.  
 
 
Section 5:  Calculation of M using Residual Contractual Maturity 
 
5.1 
Subject to paragraph 5.2 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank which is not able to 
calculate M in accordance with Sections 1 to 4 of this Annex must use a more conservative 
measure of M, calculated as the maximum remaining time (in years) that the obligor is 
permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligation (including principal, interest, 
and fees) under the terms of the agreement giving rise to the obligation470, subject to a 
minimum M of one year and a cap on M of 5 years. The Reporting Bank must not apply 
the one-year maturity floor to short-term exposures as defined in paragraph 4.2 of this 
Annex. 
 
5.2 
A Reporting Bank may cap M at one year for each netting set for which the 
Reporting Bank calculates CVA RWA under either the BA-CVA or the SA-CVA.  
 
 
Section 6:  Calculation of Tranche Maturity for Securitisation Exposures 
 
6.1 
 Subject to paragraphs 6.2 and 6.3 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
calculate the tranche maturity MT of a securitisation exposure in years –  
 
(a) 
as the weighted-average maturity of the contractual cash flows of the 
tranche, in accordance with the following formula: 
 
where “CFt” denotes the cash flows (including principal, interest payments 
and fees) contractually payable by the obligor in period t. The contractual 
cash flows must be unconditional and must not be dependent on the actual 
performance of the underlying exposures; or  
 
(b) 
on the basis of the final legal maturity of the tranche, in accordance with 
the following formula:  
𝑀𝑇= 1 + (𝑀𝐿−1) ∙80% 
 
470 
In some instances, this will correspond to the notional maturity of the instrument. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-317 
 
where “ML” is the final legal maturity of the tranche. 
 
6.2 
The Reporting Bank must calculate tranche maturity on the basis of the final 
legal maturity in accordance with paragraph 6.1(b) of this Annex, if unconditional 
contractual payment dates are not available. 
 
6.3 
The Reporting Bank must subject the tranche maturity calculated in accordance 
with paragraph 6.1 of this Annex to a cap of 5 years and a floor of one year.  
 
6.4 
In calculating MT, a Reporting Bank must take into account the maximum period 
of time it is exposed to potential losses from the underlying exposures as follows: 
 
(a) 
where the Reporting Bank provides a commitment to a securitisation 
transaction, the Reporting Bank must calculate MT of the securitisation 
exposure resulting from this commitment as the sum of the contractual 
maturity of the commitment and the longest maturity of the underlying 
exposures to which the Reporting Bank would be exposed after a draw on 
the commitment has occurred. If the underlying exposures are revolving 
loans, the Reporting Bank must apply the longest contractually possible 
remaining maturity of the asset that might be added to the underlying 
pool during the revolving period, rather than the longest maturity of the 
assets currently in the underlying pool; 
 
(b) 
where the Reporting Bank provides any other instrument to a 
securitisation transaction resulting in a securitisation exposure of the 
Reporting Bank that is not limited to losses realised until the maturity of 
that instrument 471 , the Reporting Bank must calculate MT of the 
securitisation exposure resulting from this instrument in accordance with 
sub-paragraph (a); 
 
(c) 
where the Reporting Bank provides a credit protection instrument to a 
securitisation transaction resulting in a securitisation exposure of the 
Reporting Bank that is limited to losses that occur up to the maturity of 
the instrument provided, the Reporting Bank must calculate MT of the 
securitisation exposure resulting from this instrument as the contractual 
maturity of the instrument. The Reporting Bank must not look through to 
the protected position in the calculation of MT.

Annex 7W 
 
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS ON INFORMATION AND DATA USED FOR DERIVING 
ESTIMATES OF IRBA PARAMETERS 
 
 
1.1 
The appropriate length of the information and data series for each IRBA asset 
sub-class would depend on, inter-alia, the information and data sources, the IRBA asset 
sub-class in question, the risk characteristics of the exposures, the type of rating system 
in use by the Reporting Bank, and the representativeness of the information and data 
series to the exposures of the Reporting Bank at the relevant time. A Reporting Bank may 
be expected to apply additional margins of conservatism if the Authority deems that the 
information and data series used by the Reporting Bank is inadequate or not sufficiently 
representative.     
 
1.2 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the historical observations of IRBA 
parameters, henceforth referred to as data series in this Annex, are not shorter than as 
set out in paragraphs 1.3 to 1.5 of this Annex.472 The Reporting Bank must also consider 
if its data series is of sufficient breadth to cover a wide range of possible economic events 
and is representative of the Reporting Bank’s exposures at the relevant time. 
 
 
Minimum Requirements for IRBA Wholesale Asset Class  
 
1.3 
Without prejudice to paragraph 1.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must ensure 
that the data series used in the process for deriving estimates of IRBA parameters for any 
exposure that falls within the IRBA wholesale asset class –  
  
(a) 
for deriving any PD estimate, covers at least 5 years for at least one data 
source. 473 This is irrespective of whether the Reporting Bank is using 
external, internal, or pooled data sources, or a combination of the above. 
If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source 
and the data is relevant and material, the Reporting Bank must use the 
longer period;  
 
(b) 
for deriving any LGD estimate, is no shorter than a period of 7 years and 
ideally covers a complete economic cycle for at least one data source. If 
the available observation period spans a longer period for any source and 
the data is relevant and material, the Reporting Bank must use the longer 
period; and 
 
(c) 
for deriving any EAD estimate, is no shorter than a period of 7 years and 
ideally covers a complete economic cycle for at least one data source. If 
the available observation period spans a longer period for any source and 
the data is relevant and material, the Reporting Bank must use the longer 
period.  
 
 
472  
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank should not expect that merely meeting the minimum expectations on the 
length of the data series as set out in paragraphs 1.3 to 1.5 of this Annex will automatically qualify the 
Reporting Bank for IRBA adoption. 
473  
The data should include a representative mix of good and bad years.

Minimum Requirements for IRBA Retail Asset Class  
 
1.4 
Without prejudice to paragraph 1.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must ensure 
that the data series used in the process for deriving estimates of IRBA parameters for any 
exposure that falls within the IRBA retail asset class – 
 
 
(a) 
for deriving any PD estimate, covers at least 5 years474, irrespective of 
whether the Reporting Bank is using external, internal, or pooled data 
sources, or a combination of the above. If the available observation period 
spans a longer period for any source and the data is relevant and material, 
the Reporting Bank must use the longer period; 
 
(b) 
for deriving any LGD estimate, is no shorter than a period of 5 years and 
ideally covers a complete economic cycle relevant for the portfolio for at 
least one data source; and  
 
(c) 
for deriving any EAD estimate, is no shorter than a period of 5 years and 
ideally covers a complete economic cycle relevant for the portfolio for at 
least one data source.   
 
 
Minimum Requirements for IRBA Purchased Receivables Asset Class  
 
1.5 
Without prejudice to paragraph 1.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must ensure 
that the data series used in the process for deriving estimates of IRBA parameters for any 
exposure that falls within the IRBA purchased receivables asset class follows the treatment 
for the IRBA asset class to which the underlying purchased asset is categorised.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
474  
The data should include a representative mix of good and bad years of the economic cycle relevant for the 
portfolio.

Annex 7X 
 
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR IRBA 
 
 
Section 1: Overview 
 
 
1.1 
Introduction 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank that adopts the IRBA must observe the standards set out in 
this Annex.    
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must comply with the requirements set out in this Annex at 
the outset and on an ongoing basis475. The Reporting Bank must ensure that its overall 
credit risk management practices are consistent with the evolving sound practice 
guidelines issued by the BCBS and the Authority, where applicable.  
 
(c) 
The overarching principles behind these standards are as follows:  
  
(i) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the internal ratings of a Reporting 
Bank (including segmentations of exposures to pools of homogenous 
exposures) and the parameterisation process provide for a meaningful 
assessment of obligor and facility characteristics of the credit exposures 
of the Reporting Bank and a meaningful differentiation of risk, as well as 
generate consistent and predictive estimates of IRBA parameters suitable 
for use under IRBA to calculate regulatory capital requirements;   
 
(ii) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the internal ratings and estimates of 
IRBA parameters are used pervasively in internal credit risk management 
and other significant business decisions relating to credit risk of the 
Reporting Bank. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the rating and risk 
estimation systems and parameterisation processes are consistent with 
internal use of the estimates of IRBA parameters; and 
 
(iii) A Reporting Bank must set up and maintain a governance framework, 
including 
the 
appropriate 
organisational 
structures 
and 
control 
mechanisms, to ensure that it is able to continue to derive consistent and 
predictive estimates of IRBA parameters.     
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank must apply the standards in this Annex to all asset classes 
and to the F-IRBA, the A-IRBA and the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class, unless this 
Annex otherwise provides. The Reporting Bank must apply the standards related to the 
 
475  
A Reporting Bank should meet the guidelines set out in this Annex at the outset and on an ongoing basis. 
The Reporting Bank should also note that meeting these standards does not automatically qualify the 
Reporting Bank for IRBA adoption. The Authority will want to be assured that the intention of the Reporting 
Bank in adopting IRBA is to seek continual improvements in its risk management practices. A Reporting 
Bank should not regard these standards as an exhaustive checklist to be satisfied in order to adopt IRBA. 
The Authority will consider the willingness and ability of a Reporting Bank to maintain and improve its rating 
systems to ensure the continuing appropriateness of the capital requirements calculated using estimates 
of IRBA parameters derived from the rating systems. The Authority will also consider a Reporting Bank’s 
abilities to rank order and quantify risk in a consistent, reliable and valid manner.

process of assigning exposures to obligor or facility grades (and the related standards on 
oversight, validation, etc.) equally to the process of assigning retail exposures to pools of 
homogenous exposures, unless this Annex otherwise provides. 
 
 
Section 2: Oversight and Control 
 
 
2.1 
Board Oversight 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board has ultimate responsibility for the 
continuing appropriateness of the rating systems, the parameterisation process, the use 
of the rating systems and estimates of IRBA parameters, and stress tests476. This includes 
responsibility for the adequacy of control processes in respect of these areas. Accordingly, 
a Reporting Bank must undertake efforts to equip the Board with a general understanding 
of the objectives and basis of the rating systems and parameterisation process of the 
Reporting Bank. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the information provided to the 
Board is adequate for the Board to be able to perform its roles effectively. 
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board reviews and approves all 
important aspects of the rating systems, parameterisation process, use of rating systems 
and estimates of IRBA parameters, and stress tests of the Reporting Bank.  
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must inform the Board of material changes to the rating 
systems, the parameterisation process, and the controls in respect of the rating systems 
and parameterisation process. The Reporting Bank must inform the Board of any 
significant exceptions from established policies and procedures, or weaknesses in respect 
of the design and operation of rating systems, parameterisation process, the use of rating 
systems and estimates of IRBA parameters, or stress tests of the Reporting Bank.477  
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board establishes comprehensive and 
adequate written policies and procedures relating to the oversight and control of the design 
and operation of its rating systems, the parameterisation process, the use of rating 
systems and estimates of IRBA parameters, and stress tests of the Reporting Bank478. At 
a minimum, the Reporting Bank must ensure that these policies include – 
 
(i)  
the roles and responsibilities of the Board, senior management and other 
personnel involved in the design and approval of the rating systems and 
parameterisation process of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(ii)  the internal control processes and independent oversight of the design and 
operation of its rating systems, the parameterisation process of the 
Reporting Bank, the use of rating systems and estimates of IRBA 
parameters, and stress tests; 
 
 
476 
The roles of the Board should include, but not be confined to, the areas under paragraph 2.1(b) to (d) of 
this Annex. 
477  
For example, a Reporting Bank should report persistent concentrations of obligors in particular obligor 
grades (for wholesale exposures), and persistent occurrences of significant differences between realised 
and predicted outcomes of estimates of IRBA parameters for any IRBA asset sub-class, to the Board. 
478  
A Reporting Bank should ensure that the Board integrates the IRBA systems and practices of the Reporting 
Bank into its risk management processes and operations.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-322 
(iii)  the matters which the Reporting Bank considers material and the authority 
and approval levels for these matters;  
 
(iv)  the frequency and level of detail of reporting to the Board and senior 
management on the rating systems of the Reporting Bank; and 
 
(v)  the frequency and level of detail of reporting to the Board and senior 
management on the estimates of IRBA parameters used by the Reporting 
Bank to calculate regulatory capital requirements under IRBA. 
 
 
2.2 
Senior Management Oversight 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management exercises active 
oversight exceeding the level of involvement by the Board to ensure the continuing 
appropriateness of the rating systems, the parameterisation process, the use of rating 
systems and estimates of IRBA parameters, and stress tests.479  
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management has a good 
understanding of the design and operation of the rating systems, parameterisation process, 
the use of rating systems and estimates of IRBA parameters, and stress tests of the 
Reporting Bank. The Reporting Bank must also ensure that senior management has a good 
understanding of its credit policies, underwriting standards, lending practices, as well as 
collection and recovery practices. The Reporting Bank must ensure that senior 
management approves material aspects of these areas and material differences between 
established procedure and actual practice and reports significant issues to the Board on a 
regular and timely basis.   
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must also ensure that senior management ensures, on an 
ongoing basis, that the rating systems and the parameterisation process –  
 
(i) 
provide for a meaningful assessment of obligor and facility characteristics 
of the credit exposures of the Reporting Bank, a meaningful differentiation 
of risk, and generate consistent and predictive estimates of IRBA 
parameters suitable for use under IRBA to calculate regulatory capital 
requirements; and  
 
(ii) 
are consistent with all applicable rules and regulations as well as 
established internal policies.   
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management and staff in the credit 
control functions meet regularly to discuss the consistency of ratings assignments, the 
 
479 
The Reporting Bank should ensure that senior management articulates its expectations and provides 
guidance for the technical and operational aspects in respect of these areas. The roles of senior 
management should include, but not be confined to the areas under paragraph 2.2(b) to (d) of this Annex. 
A Reporting Bank should also ensure that – 
(a)  senior management exercises active oversight to ensure steps are taken by staff at all levels to 
integrate the IRBA systems and practices of the Reporting Bank into its day-to-day risk management 
processes and operations; and 
(b) senior management ensures that the staff responsible for any aspect of its rating systems, including 
ratings assignments, credit risk control and internal validation, are adequately qualified and trained to 
undertake their respective roles.   


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-323 
parameterisation process, areas needing improvement, and the status of efforts to 
improve previously identified deficiencies.  
 
 
2.3 
Regular Reporting to the Board and Senior Management  
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must integrate internal ratings, estimates of IRBA parameters 
and results of stress tests into regular reports to the Board and senior management on 
the changes in the risk profile of the Reporting Bank, trends in risk-adjusted profitability, 
and the material risks which the Reporting Bank is exposed to.480   
 
(b) 
At a minimum, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and senior 
management get regular reports on all of the following for material credit portfolios: 
 
(i) 
risk profile by internal grade (or in the case of retail exposures, risk profile 
by exposure pool); 
 
(ii) 
risk rating migration across grades with emphasis on unexpected results; 
 
(iii) changes in estimates of IRBA parameters by obligor and facility grade (and 
in the case of retail exposures, changes in estimates of IRBA parameters 
of exposure pools); 
 
(iv) comparison of realised PD, LGD, and EAD against the estimates of IRBA 
parameters of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(v) 
changes in regulatory capital requirements under IRBA and economic 
capital over time; 
 
(vi) results of credit stress testing;   
 
(vii) results of internal validation, including results of replication tests 
performed to check for systematic biases in rating assignments; 
 
(viii) reports from internal audit and credit risk control units on material issues 
in respect of the Reporting Bank’s IRBA systems.  
 
 
2.4 
Credit Risk Control Function 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must have a credit risk control unit481 that is responsible for 
the design or selection, implementation and performance of the rating systems of the 
Reporting Bank, and for putting in place an appropriate parameterisation process. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the unit is structurally and functionally independent from 
the personnel and management functions responsible for originating exposures.   
 
 
 
480  
A Reporting Bank should ensure that the depth and frequency of information provided to these parties is 
commensurate with the operations, size, and risk profile of the Reporting Bank.  
481  
A Reporting Bank should ensure that the evaluation of the performance and remuneration of the credit risk 
control unit takes into consideration how well credit risks are managed (e.g. the reliability and consistency 
of rating assignments and predictiveness of estimates of IRBA parameters or other risk estimates).  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-324 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the areas of responsibility of the credit risk 
control unit(s) include at least all of the following:  
 
(i) 
testing and monitoring internal grades; 
 
(ii) 
conducting comprehensive stress tests in accordance with Section 6 of this 
Annex; 
 
(iii) producing and analysing summary reports from the rating systems of the 
Reporting Bank, including historical default data sorted by rating at the 
time of default and one year prior to default, grade migration analyses, as 
well as monitoring trends in key rating criteria; 
 
(iv) ensuring the reliability and consistency of the estimates of IRBA 
parameters, including implementing procedures to verify that rating 
definitions are consistently applied across departments and geographic 
areas. In this regard, the Reporting Bank must implement internal 
standards for the estimate of IRBA parameters and associated remedial 
actions to be taken when such standards are not met; 
 
(v) 
reviewing and documenting any changes to the rating process, including 
the reasons for the changes; 
 
(vi) reviewing the rating criteria to evaluate if they remain predictive of risk. 
The Reporting Bank must document and retain changes to the rating 
process, criteria or individual rating parameters; 
 
(vii) participating actively in the design or selection, implementation and 
validation of rating systems;   
 
(viii) oversight and supervision responsibilities for any systems used in the 
rating process, and ultimate responsibility for the ongoing assessments of 
the performance of and alterations to the rating systems. In this regard, 
the Reporting Bank must use one or more of the appropriate 
methodologies or techniques in assessing the discriminatory power of the 
rating systems and the stability of such power. The Reporting Bank must 
also implement internal standards for assessing the discriminatory power 
of its rating systems and associated remedial actions to be taken when 
such standards are not met;  
 
(ix) establishing and documenting the accountability and reporting structure 
of the credit risk control unit.  
 
 
2.5 
Internal Validation 
 
(a) 
Internal validation encompasses a range of processes and activities that 
contribute to the internal assessment of a Reporting Bank of whether it is capable of 
deriving consistent and predictive estimates of IRBA parameters. A Reporting Bank has 
primary responsibility for internal validation. A Reporting Bank must have a robust system 
in place to validate the accuracy and consistency of its rating systems, processes, and the 
estimation of all relevant risk components. A Reporting Bank must demonstrate to the 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-325 
satisfaction of the Authority that its internal validation process enables it to assess the 
performance of its internal rating and risk estimation systems consistently and 
meaningfully, and its internal validation is robust and likely to remain so.    
 
(b) 
Internal validation is an iterative process and encompasses both quantitative 
and qualitative elements. A Reporting Bank must perform regular internal validation of its 
rating systems (at least annually). The Reporting Bank must ensure that such internal 
validation comprises at least all of the following: 
 
(i)  
assessment of whether the standards in this Annex relating to the design 
of rating systems, rating systems operations, deriving estimates of IRBA 
parameters (only PD, in the case of a Reporting Bank adopting the F-IRBA; 
PD, LGD and EAD, in the case of a Reporting Bank adopting the A-IRBA or 
the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class) oversight and control and stress 
tests are met; 
 
(ii)  assessment of whether in totality, the systems and processes of the 
Reporting Bank in respect of the areas outlined in paragraph 2.5(b)(i) of 
this Annex have adhered to the overarching principles under paragraph 
1.1(c) of this Annex;   
 
(iii)  regular comparison of realised outcomes with estimates of IRBA 
parameters, using historical data over as long a period as possible, 
covering a range of economic conditions, and ideally one or more complete 
business cycles. A Reporting Bank must regularly compare realised default 
rates with estimated PDs for each rating grade and demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Authority that the realised default rates are within the 
expected range for that grade. A Reporting Bank which is using the A-IRBA 
or the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class must complete such analysis for 
its estimates of LGDs and EADs. A Reporting Bank must clearly document 
the methods and data used in such comparisons, and update this analysis 
and documentation at least annually;482 
 
(iv)  use of appropriate validation methodology and quantitative tools, and 
comparison with relevant (i.e. in terms of appropriateness, timeliness and 
time period) external data sources where applicable. A Reporting Bank 
must ensure that the analysis must be based on data that is appropriate 
to the portfolio, are updated regularly and cover a relevant observation 
period. A Reporting Bank must ensure that internal assessments of the 
performance of its rating systems are based on long data histories, 
covering a range of economic conditions, and ideally one or more business 
cycles. A Reporting Bank must demonstrate that the validation 
methodologies and tools do not vary systematically with the economic 
cycle; 
 
 
 
482 
A Reporting Bank adopting the F-IRBA should compare realised (i.e. historical) LGDs and EADs to those 
that the Authority has set and take such comparisons into account in its ICAAP.  Where the realised 
outcomes are materially higher than what the Authority has set, the Reporting Bank should consider if 
additional capital buffers would be appropriate in its ICAAP.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-326 
(v)  well-articulated internal validation standards, taking into account business 
cycles and similar systematic variability in default experiences, for 
distinguishing situations where deviations in realised outcomes of IRBA 
parameters from expectations (i.e. estimates of IRBA parameters) 
become significant enough to call into question the validity and predictive 
power of the estimates of IRBA parameters. Where such deviations 
continue to be significant, a Reporting Bank must revise relevant 
estimates of IRBA parameters upwards to reflect its default and loss 
experience;  
 
(vi)  in the case where a Reporting Bank uses a statistical rating model, it must 
also monitor the performance and stability of the statistical rating model 
and review the inherent statistical relationships and assumptions of the 
model.  
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that no person responsible for the design or 
implementation of the rating system for a class of exposures or the parameterisation 
process for that class of exposures participates in the validation work relating to that rating 
system. Where any person or group of persons is involved in the validation work relating 
to a rating system designed or implemented by another person or group of persons of the 
same unit, the Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management ensures that there 
is no conflict of interest, and that the person or group of persons involved in the validation 
work relating to that rating system can provide objective and effective challenge to the 
person or group of persons responsible for the design or implementation of that rating 
system and the parameterisation process.  
 
 
2.6 
Independent Review of Internal Validation  
 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the IA reporting to the Audit Committee 
reviews the internal validation processes of the rating systems and ensure that validation 
processes are implemented as designed and are effective. In performing this role, the IA 
may seek the assistance of other internal or third party specialists, so long as overall 
responsibility remains with the IA. 
 
(b) 
In the event where the IA has sought assistance from internal or external 
specialists in the review process for any class of exposures, a Reporting Bank must ensure 
that such specialists are not involved in or responsible for – 
 
(i)  
the design, selection or implementation of rating systems used for that 
class of exposures; 
 
(ii) 
the parameterisation process for that class of exposures; and  
 
(iii) the origination of exposures for that class of exposures. 
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the IA conducts regular reviews (at least 
annually) of the ongoing validation of the IRBA systems of the Reporting Bank. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the review at least covers aspects of the internal 
validation related to the operations and processes of the credit risk control function. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the IA conducts checks to attest to the depth, scope, 
and quality of the internal validation to ensure that its findings are well founded. In 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-327 
particular, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the checks cover the process of the 
Reporting Bank for estimating, documenting and justifying the estimates of IRBA 
parameters used to calculate regulatory capital requirements under IRBA, given that it is 
an important area which affects regulatory capital requirements.483 The Reporting Bank 
must also ensure that the IA ensures that the person or group of persons involved in the 
internal validation of a rating system is independent from those involved in designing or 
implementing that rating system or in the related parameterisation process and is able to 
provide objective and effective challenge, as specified in paragraph 2.5(c) of this Annex.  
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the IA – 
 
(i) 
documents the scope of its review and the findings and recommendations 
in respect of its independent review of the internal validation;  
 
(ii) 
proactively discusses its findings and recommendations in respect of its 
independent review of the internal validation with senior management of 
the Reporting Bank;  
 
(iii) reports important findings to the Audit Committee on a timely basis; and 
 
(iv) monitors the implementation of the recommendations accepted by the 
Audit Committee and report incidences of non-implementation to the Audit 
Committee.  
 
(e) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Audit Committee ensures that IA is 
adequately qualified and trained to assume its responsibilities of independent review of 
the internal validation of the Reporting Bank.   
 
 
2.7 
Use of Internal Ratings and Estimates of IRBA Parameters 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must not design its rating systems and parameterisation 
process exclusively for the purposes of qualifying for IRBA. The Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the internal ratings and estimates of IRBA parameters are used pervasively 
by the Reporting Bank and play an essential role in –  
 
(i) 
credit approval; 
 
(ii) 
risk management and setting of risks tolerances for credit portfolios; 
 
(iii) internal capital allocations and pricing; 
 
(iv) provisioning; and 
 
(v) 
corporate governance functions, including reporting to the Board and 
senior management on credit risk profile and trends. 
 
 
483 
The Authority may also require an external audit of the Reporting Bank’s rating assignment process and its 
estimates of IRBA parameters. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-328 
While internal ratings and estimates of IRBA parameters must play an essential role in 
these areas mentioned above, a Reporting Bank need not ensure that the internal ratings 
and estimates of IRBA parameters play an exclusive or primary role in the areas above484. 
 
(b) 
While a Reporting Bank may not necessarily be using the same estimates of 
IRBA parameters for all internal purposes specified in paragraph 2.7(a) of this Annex485, 
it must nevertheless document the differences and the justifications for such differences. 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the justifications provide the reasonableness of use 
of certain estimates in each particular instance, and a demonstration of consistency in the 
use of the different set of the estimates or in the risk factors or criteria driving these 
estimates. The Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management approves the use of 
different estimates of IRBA parameters for different purposes.  
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must have a credible track record in the use of internal ratings 
and estimates of IRBA parameters. A Reporting Bank adopting IRBA for a class of 
exposures must demonstrate that it has been using a rating system for the class of 
exposures as at the IRBA adoption date for the class of exposures, broadly in line with the 
minimum standards for use, for at least the 3 years prior to the IRBA adoption date for 
the class of exposures. 
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank using the A-IRBA or the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class 
for a class of exposures must demonstrate that it has been estimating and employing LGDs 
and EADs in a manner that is broadly consistent with the applicable standards for use of 
own estimates of LGDs and EADs in this Annex for at least the 3 years prior to the adoption 
date for the A-IRBA or the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class for the class of exposures.   
 
(e) 
For the purposes of meeting the standards on duration of use under paragraph 
2.7(c) and (d) of this Annex, improvements to a Reporting Bank’s rating systems will not 
render a Reporting Bank non-compliant provided that the changes do not render prior use 
experience irrelevant in assessing the reliability of the rating systems.  
 
 
2.8 
Documentation 
 
(a)  
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the internal validation of a Reporting Bank 
is comprehensively documented. A Reporting Bank must ensure that the internal validation 
itself is based on comprehensively documented processes and systems. A Reporting Bank 
must document clearly changes in validation methodology and tools, and data used, 
including data sources and periods covered. The objective of these requirements is to 
promote the stability of the IRBA systems and to enable independent verification.  
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must document in writing the design and operational details 
of its rating systems. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the documentation evidences 
the observance of the standards in this Annex by the Reporting Bank, and addresses topics 
including portfolio differentiation, rating criteria, rating process, overrides and 
management oversight of the rating systems. In addition, the Reporting Bank must also 
 
484  
A Reporting Bank should also consider the internal ratings and estimates of IRBA parameters in other 
significant decisions relating to credit risk, such as – 
(a) business strategies, and potential mergers and acquisitions;  
(b) performance measurement and performance-related remuneration; and 
(c) credit targeting or credit portfolio rebalancing.  
485 
For example, pricing models are likely to use PDs and LGDs relevant to the life of the asset. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-329 
articulate its rating philosophy486, including implications for capital adequacy as economic 
conditions change.  
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the documentation of the rating criteria by 
a Reporting Bank includes at least all of the following: 
 
(i)  
the rationale for the choice of rating criteria, including analyses 
demonstrating that the rating criteria and procedures are likely to result 
in ratings that meaningfully differentiate risk, and that the rating criteria 
have taken all relevant and material obligor and transaction characteristics 
into account;  
 
(ii)  the rationale for assigning an obligor or a group of obligors to a particular 
rating system if the Reporting Bank uses multiple rating systems within 
each asset class;  
 
(iii) the relationship between obligor grades in terms of the level of risk each 
grade implies, and the risk of each grade in terms of both a description of 
the probability of default typical for obligors assigned to that grade and 
the criteria used to distinguish that level of credit risk;  
 
(iv)  the relationship between facility grades in terms of the level of risk each 
grade implies, and the risk of each grade in terms of both a description of 
the expected severity of loss upon default and the criteria used to 
distinguish that level of credit risk;487  
 
(v)  the periodic review of rating criteria and procedures to determine whether 
the rating criteria remain fully applicable to the current portfolio taking 
into account external conditions. 
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the documentation of the rating process by 
a Reporting Bank includes at least all of the following: 
 
 
(i)  
the responsibilities of the parties that rate and approve rating grades for 
obligors and facilities; 
 
(ii)  the definition of what constitutes a rating exception and override, and the 
situations where exceptions and overrides can be used and the approval 
authorities for such exceptions and overrides; 
 
(iii)  the frequency of rating reviews, including the policy on refreshing relevant 
and material obligor and facility characteristics;  
 
(iv)  the history of significant changes in the rating process to enable easy 
identification of any changes made to the rating process subsequent to 
 
486 
A rating philosophy is a broad term referring to the approach of the Reporting Bank in assigning obligors 
to groups that are expected to share common default frequencies, including whether the Reporting Bank 
groups obligors by expected common default frequency over the next year or over a wider range of possible 
economic and stress outcomes. 
487 
A Reporting Bank adopting the F-IRBA may fulfil this requirement by describing the risk of each facility 
grade in terms of both obligor and transaction-specific factors if the facility dimension reflects both these 
factors. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

the last supervisory review by the Authority or by the home supervisor of 
a foreign bank subsidiary;  
 
(v)  the organisation of rating assignment, including the internal control 
structure.  
 
(e) 
A Reporting Bank must document the specific definitions of default and loss 
used and demonstrate consistency with the definitions set out in Annexes 7L and 7U. 
 
(f) 
If a Reporting Bank employs statistical models in the rating process, the 
Reporting Bank must document the methodologies. The Reporting Bank must ensure that 
the documentation includes at least all of the following: 
 
(i)  
a detailed outline of the theory, assumptions and mathematical and 
empirical basis for deriving estimates of IRBA parameters for grades, 
individual obligors, exposures or pools of exposures, and the data sources 
used to estimate the model; 
 
(ii)  a rigorous statistical process (including out-of-time and out-of-sample 
performance tests) for validating the model;  
 
(iii)  any circumstances under which the model does not work effectively.  
 
(g) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the standards in this Annex are met where 
it uses a model obtained from a third-party vendor. To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank 
must still comply with the standards in this Annex, including the requirements on 
documentation in paragraph 2.8 of this Annex, where it uses a model from a third-party 
vendor that claims proprietary technology.  
 
 
Section 3: Design of Rating Systems  
 
 
3.1 
Multiple Rating Systems: Standards for Wholesale and Retail Exposures 
 
(a) 
If a Reporting Bank uses multiple rating systems488, the Reporting Bank must 
document the rationale for assigning an obligor or credit facility to a rating system. A 
Reporting Bank must assign an obligor or credit facility to the rating system that is most 
appropriate to measure the risk of the obligor or the credit facility. A Reporting Bank must 
not allocate obligors or credit facilities across rating systems inappropriately to minimise 
regulatory capital requirements (i.e. cherry-picking by choice of rating system). A 
Reporting Bank must demonstrate that each rating system used for IRBA purposes meets 
the minimum standards as set out in this Annex at the outset and on an ongoing basis.  
 
 
 
488  
A Reporting Bank may use multiple rating systems (including the case of multiple rating methodologies 
under a common rating system framework) within each IRBA asset sub-class. For example, a Reporting 
Bank may have customised rating systems for specific industries or market segments (e.g. middle market, 
or large corporate) within an IRBA asset sub-class.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-331 
3.2 
Rating Dimensions: Standards for Wholesale Exposures 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the rating systems for its wholesale 
exposures have 2 separate and distinct dimensions: (i) one that is oriented to the risk of 
obligor default (“obligor dimension”), and (ii) one that takes into account transaction-
specific factors (“facility dimension”).  
 
(b) 
For the obligor dimension, a Reporting Bank must assign the same obligor grade 
to separate credit exposures to the same obligor, irrespective of any differences in the 
nature of each specific transaction, except under the following circumstances where 
separate credit exposures may result in multiple obligor grades for the same obligor: 
 
(i) 
the rating systems are also used to measure country or jurisdiction 
transfer risks. Under such a circumstance, the Reporting Bank may assign 
a different obligor grade to a credit exposure denominated in foreign 
currency from a credit exposure denominated in local currency if the 
Reporting Bank has a documented framework for taking into account 
country or jurisdiction transfer risks. The framework must at least cover 
the methodology for assigning different obligor grades to foreign currency 
and local currency exposures;  
 
(ii) 
a Reporting Bank adjusts the obligor grade of a credit exposure on account 
of associated guarantees in respect of that credit exposure.   
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must articulate in its credit policy the relationship between 
obligor grades in terms of the level of risk each grade implies. The Reporting Bank must 
ensure that perceived and measured risk increases as credit quality declines from one 
obligor grade to the next. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the credit policy  
articulates the risk of each obligor grade in terms of both a description of the probability 
of default typical for obligors assigned to that grade and the criteria used to distinguish 
that level of credit risk.  
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the facility dimension reflects transaction-
specific factors, including collateral, seniority, product type, industry and purpose in 
respect of any credit facility. For a Reporting Bank adopting –  
 
 (i) 
F-IRBA for the credit exposure, this standard may be fulfilled by a facility 
dimension which reflects both obligor and transaction-specific factors, 
including a rating dimension that reflects EL by incorporating both obligor 
strength (PD) and loss severity (LGD) considerations, or by a rating 
dimension that exclusively reflects LGD. Where a rating dimension reflects 
EL and does not separately quantify LGD, the Reporting Bank must use 
the supervisory estimates of LGD; or 
 
(ii) 
A-IRBA for the credit exposure, a Reporting Bank must ensure that facility 
ratings reflect only factors that can influence LGD. A Reporting bank may 
only include obligor characteristics as rating criteria to the extent they are 
predictive of LGD. A Reporting Bank may alter the factors that influence 
facility grades across segments of the portfolio if it is able to demonstrate 
to the satisfaction of the Authority that the alteration improves the 
relevance and reliability of its LGD estimates.  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-332 
 
(e) 
Despite paragraph 3.2(a) to (d) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank using the 
supervisory slotting criteria for the SL asset sub-class and the HVCRE asset sub-class may 
use rating systems with a single rating dimension that reflects EL by incorporating both 
the risk of obligor default and transaction-specific factors, given the interdependence of 
obligor and transaction-specific factors for exposures categorised under the SL asset sub-
class and HVCRE asset sub-class.  
 
 
3.3  
Rating Dimensions: Standards for Retail Exposures 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that rating systems for credit exposures 
categorised under the IRBA retail asset class are oriented to both obligor and transaction 
risk, and capture all relevant obligor and transaction characteristics.  
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must have a process of assigning exposures categorised 
under the IRBA retail asset class into pools of homogenous exposures, with corresponding 
quantitative measures of default and loss characteristics (i.e. PD, LGD and EAD estimates) 
for each pool. The Reporting Bank may use identical estimates for some, but must not use 
identical estimates for all IRBA parameters for different pools of exposures. The Reporting 
Bank must demonstrate that the process of assigning exposures to pools provides for a 
meaningful differentiation of risk and for a grouping of sufficiently homogenous exposures, 
and allows for consistent and predictive estimation of default and loss characteristics for 
each pool of exposures. The Reporting Bank must consider at least the following risk 
drivers when assigning any exposure to a pool of exposures:  
 
(i) 
obligor characteristics including obligor type and demographics489; 
 
(ii) 
facility characteristics, including product, collateral types, loan to collateral 
value measures in the case of secured facilities, seasoning490, guarantees, 
seniority of the facility, and cross-collateral provisions;  
 
(iii) delinquency of exposure. A Reporting Bank must identify exposures that 
are delinquent from those that are not.   
 
 
3.4 
Rating Structure: Standards for Wholesale Exposures 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must have a meaningful distribution of exposures across 
grades with no excessive concentrations, on both its obligor-rating and its facility-rating 
scales.   
 
 
489  
For example, age or occupation. 
490  
For each pool of exposures, a Reporting Bank should analyse the representativeness of the age of the 
facilities (in terms of time since origination for PD and time since the date of default for LGD) in the data 
used to derive the estimates of the Reporting Bank’s actual facilities. Where default rates peak several 
years after origination or where recovery rates show a low point several years after default, a Reporting 
Bank should adjust the estimates with an adequate margin of conservatism to account for the lack of 
representativeness and anticipated implications of rapid exposure growth. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-333 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its rating systems for the obligor dimension 
have at least 7 obligor grades for non-defaulted obligors and one grade for defaulted 
obligors.491 In this regard, – 
 
(i) 
a Reporting Bank must have a grade definition for each obligor grade. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the grade definition includes both a 
description of the degree of default risk typical for obligors assigned to 
that grade and the criteria used to distinguish that level of credit risk. “+” 
or “-” modifiers to alpha or numeric grades may qualify as distinct grades 
only if the Reporting Bank has developed complete rating descriptions and 
criteria for their assignment, and separately derives PD estimates for 
alpha or numeric grades with “+” or “-” modifiers; and  
 
(ii) 
a Reporting Bank with a loan portfolio concentrated in a particular market 
segment and range of default risk must have enough grades within that 
range to avoid undue concentrations of obligors in particular grades. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that significant concentrations within a single 
grade or grades are supported by convincing empirical evidence that the 
grade or grades cover reasonably narrow PD bands and that the default 
risk posed by all obligors in a grade fall within that band.   
 
(c) 
For the facility dimension, a Reporting Bank adopting the A-IRBA must have a 
sufficient number of facility grades to avoid grouping facilities with widely varying LGDs 
into a single grade. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the criteria used to define facility 
grades is grounded in empirical evidence.   
 
(d)  
A Reporting Bank using the supervisory slotting criteria for the SL asset sub-
class and HVCRE asset sub-class must have at least 4 grades for non-defaulted obligors 
and one grade for defaulted obligors.  
 
 
3.5 
 
Rating Structure: Standards for Retail Exposures 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the number of exposures in a given pool is 
sufficiently large to allow for meaningful quantification and validation of the default and 
loss characteristics at the pool level. However, the Reporting Bank must ensure that there 
is also a meaningful distribution of obligors and exposures across pools within any IRBA 
retail asset sub-class, i.e. a single pool does not include an undue concentration of the 
exposures of the Reporting Bank in any IRBA retail asset sub-class.   
 
 
3.6 
 
Rating Definitions and Criteria: Standards for Wholesale Exposures 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must have specific rating definitions, processes and criteria 
for assigning exposures to grades within a rating system. The Reporting Bank must ensure 
that the rating definitions and criteria are both plausible and intuitive and result in a 
meaningful differentiation of risk. In this regard, the Reporting Bank must ensure that –  
 
 
491  
Where a Reporting Bank lends to obligors of diverse credit quality, its rating systems for the obligor 
dimension should have a greater number of obligor grades.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-334 
(i) 
the rating definitions and criteria are sufficiently detailed to allow those 
responsible for assigning ratings to consistently assign the same grade to 
obligors or facilities posing similar risk.492 If rating criteria and procedures 
differ for different types of obligors or facilities that are rated using the 
same rating system, a Reporting Bank must monitor for possible 
inconsistency with the prescribed rating criteria and procedures, and 
continually seek to improve the degree of consistency; 
 
(ii) 
written rating definitions, processes and criteria are clear and detailed 
enough to allow parties independent of the assignment of ratings, 
including IA and the Authority, to understand the assignment of obligor 
and facility ratings, replicate the assignments, and evaluate the 
appropriateness of the assignments; and 
 
(iii) the rating criteria is also consistent with the internal lending standards of 
a Reporting Bank and its policies for handling obligors and facilities. 
  
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must use all relevant, reliable and material information in 
assigning ratings to obligor and facilities. While an external rating can be an important 
factor determining an internal rating assignment, the Reporting Bank must ensure that it 
considers other relevant information. A Reporting Bank must –  
 
(i)  
endeavour to use current information; 
  
(ii)  specify the frequency of updating the information; and 
 
(iii)  apply greater conservatism in its assignments of exposures to obligor or 
facility grades if the Reporting Bank is not able to take into account all the 
information it would normally consider.  
 
 
3.7 
Segmentation Criteria: Standards for Retail Exposures 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must have specific segmentation processes and criteria for 
assigning exposures to pools. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the segmentation 
criteria is both plausible and intuitive and results in a meaningful differentiation of risk. 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that –  
 
(i) 
the segmentation criteria is sufficiently detailed to allow those responsible 
for assigning exposures into pools to consistently assign retail exposures 
posing similar risk into the same pool; 
 
(ii) 
written segmentation processes and criteria are clear and detailed enough 
to allow parties independent of the assignment of ratings, including IA and 
the Authority, to understand the assignment of exposures into pools, 
replicate the assignments, and evaluate the appropriateness of the 
assignments; and 
 
 
492  
This consistency should exist across lines of business, departments and geographic locations using the 
same rating system. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-335 
(iii) the segmentation criteria is also consistent with the internal lending 
standards of a Reporting Bank and its policies for handling exposures. 
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must use all relevant, reliable and material information in 
assigning exposures to pools. The Reporting Bank must –  
 
(i)  
endeavour to use current information; 
 
(ii) 
specify the frequency of updating the information; and 
 
(iii)  apply greater conservatism in its assignments of exposures to pools of 
exposures if the Reporting Bank is not able to take into account all the 
information it would normally consider.  
 
 
3.8 
Rating Definitions and Criteria: Standards Specific to the Use of the 
Supervisory Slotting Criteria for Exposures in the SL Asset Sub-class 
and HVCRE Asset Sub-class  
 
(a)  
A Reporting Bank using the supervisory slotting criteria for exposures in the SL 
asset sub-class and HVCRE asset sub-class must assign such exposures to internal rating 
grades based on its own criteria, systems and processes. The Reporting Bank must then 
map these internal rating grades into the supervisory rating categories in Annex 7S 
according to the general assessment factors and characteristics exhibited by the exposures 
which fall under each of the 4 types of exposures within the SL asset sub-class as defined 
in Annex 7R and the HVCRE asset sub-class.  
 
(b) 
For the purposes of paragraph 3.8(a) of this Annex – 
 
(i)  
a Reporting Bank must demonstrate that the characteristics associated 
with its internal rating grades are consistent with a preponderance of the 
characteristics of the respective supervisory rating categories to which 
they are mapped; and 
 
(ii)  where a Reporting Bank allows overrides of its internal rating grades based 
on its internal criteria, it must also demonstrate that the overrides do not 
render the mapping process ineffective. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-336 
3.9 
Rating Assignment Horizon: Standards for Wholesale and Retail 
Exposures 
 
(a) 
The time horizon used in PD estimation is one year. However, a Reporting Bank 
must use a time horizon of longer than one year in assigning ratings493. 
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that an obligor rating represents the 
conservative assessment of the obligor’s ability and willingness to contractually perform 
despite adverse economic conditions or the occurrence of unexpected events. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the range of economic conditions that are considered by 
the Reporting Bank when making such assessments are consistent with current conditions 
and those that are likely to occur over a business cycle within the respective industry, 
geographic region, or both.494  
 
(c)  
A Reporting Bank must ensure that PD estimates for obligors that are highly 
leveraged financial institutions (i.e. including hedge funds and other equivalently highly 
leveraged counterparties) and for obligors whose assets are predominantly traded assets,  
reflect the performance of the underlying assets based on periods of stressed volatilities. 
In the case of obligors that are highly leveraged financial institutions where there is likely 
a significant vulnerability to market risk, the Reporting Bank must assess the potential 
impact on the obligor’s ability to perform in periods of stressed volatilities when assigning 
a rating and corresponding PD to that obligor. 
 
(d) 
For the purposes of paragraph 3.9(b) and (c) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank 
must – 
 
(i)  
take a conservative view of projected information, given the difficulties in 
forecasting future events and the influence they will have on the financial 
condition of a particular obligor; and 
 
(ii)  adopt a conservative bias to its analysis, particularly if limited data is 
available. 
 
 
3.10 
Additional Requirements Specific to the Application of Statistical 
Models to Assign Obligor or Facility Ratings or in the Estimation of PD, 
LGD, and EAD 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank may only employ statistical models (including credit scoring 
models or other mechanical methods) as the primary or partial basis of rating assignments, 
if there is sufficient human judgement and oversight to ensure that all relevant, reliable 
and material information that has not been fully taken into account in the statistical model 
 
493  
A Reporting Bank should clearly articulate its rating philosophy and the intended time horizon underlying 
the assignment of ratings. In particular, for obligor rating systems, – 
(a) a Reporting Bank should state whether obligors are grouped by expected common default frequency 
over the next year or over a wider range of possible economic and stress outcomes; and   
(b) a Reporting Bank should articulate how its ratings are expected to migrate in response to economic 
cycles for all obligor grades. Obligors grouped by an expected common default frequency over the next 
year should experience cyclical variations in the grades to which individual obligors are assigned while 
obligors grouped by an expected common default frequency over a wider range of possible stress 
outcomes should experience relative stability in their obligor grades. 
494  
A Reporting Bank should ensure that rating systems are designed in such a way that idiosyncratic or 
industry-specific changes and business cycle effects are a driver of migrations from one category to another. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-337 
is considered495 and that the statistical model is used appropriately, and all of the following 
standards are met: 
 
(i) 
a Reporting Bank must demonstrate that a statistical model has good 
predictive power and that regulatory capital requirements will not be 
distorted as a result of its use. In particular, the Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the variables that are inputs to the model form a set of 
reasonable and plausible predictors, the model is accurate on average 
across the range of obligors or facilities to which the Reporting Bank is 
exposed and there are no known material biases; 
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank must have in place a process for vetting data inputs 
into a statistical model which includes an assessment of the accuracy, 
completeness and appropriateness of the data specific to the assignment 
of an approved rating;  
 
(iii) the Reporting Bank must have procedures in place to continually ensure 
that the data used to build the model are representative of the population 
of the Reporting Bank’s obligors or facilities;  
 
(iv) the Reporting Bank must, when combining model results with human 
judgement, take into account all relevant, reliable and material 
information not considered by the model in the judgement used, and have 
written procedures describing how human judgement and model results 
are to be combined;  
 
(v) 
the Reporting Bank must have procedures for human review of statistical 
model-based rating assignments, that include ongoing efforts to improve 
the model’s performance496; 
 
(vi) the Reporting Bank must have a regular cycle of model validation that 
includes monitoring the performance and stability of the statistical model, 
reviewing the statistical relationships, and testing the outputs against the 
outcomes of the model. The Reporting Bank must ensure that subsequent 
changes made to the statistical model meet the standards set out in this 
Annex.497  
 
 
Section 4: Rating Systems Operations  
 
 
4.1 
 
Coverage for Wholesale Exposures 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that every new and existing obligor of an 
exposure categorised under the IRBA wholesale asset class, and every protection provider 
 
495 
While statistical models may sometimes avoid some of the idiosyncratic errors made by rating systems in 
which human judgement plays a large role, there could potentially be rating errors introduced by the use 
of limited information. 
496  
Such procedures should also focus on finding and limiting errors associated with known model weaknesses. 
497  
The Reporting Bank should ensure that the details and rationale for changes made to the statistical model 
are documented before the changes take effect.   


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-338 
recognised for the purposes of calculating credit RWA for the wholesale component is 
assigned an obligor rating as part of the credit approval process. 
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that every exposure categorised under the IRBA 
wholesale asset class is associated with a facility rating as part of the credit approval 
process. 
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that each separate legal entity to which it has a 
credit exposure is assigned a separate obligor grade. The Reporting Bank must have clear 
and appropriate policies regarding the assignment of ratings to separate legal entities in 
a connected group, including –  
 
(i)  
the circumstances under which the Reporting Bank may or may not assign 
the same rating to separate legal entities within a connected group; and 
 
(ii)  the definition of a connected group of legal entities for the purposes of 
rating assignment.  
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the policies regarding the assignment of 
ratings include a process for the identification of specific wrong-way risk for each legal 
entity to which the Reporting Bank is exposed.  
 
 
4.2 
Coverage for Retail Exposures 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that every new and existing exposure 
categorised under the IRBA retail asset class is assigned to a pool consisting of exposures 
with similar default and loss characteristics as part, or immediately upon completion, of 
the credit approval process.   
 
 
4.3 
Integrity of Rating Process: Standards Applicable to Wholesale 
Exposures 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the rating assignments and periodic rating 
reviews are approved by an independent person or unit.498   
 
(b) 
For the purposes of paragraph 4.3(a) of this Annex, an independent person or 
unit is one that does not directly stand to benefit from the extension of credit.  
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must have in place rigorous internal policies for assessing the 
creditworthiness of every obligor and protection provider recognised for the purposes of 
calculating credit RWA, and the riskiness of each facility. The Reporting Bank must ensure 
that its credit policies and underwriting procedures foster and reinforce the consistency 
and independence of the rating process. The Reporting Bank must document the 
operational processes in its policies and procedures.  
 
 
498  
A Reporting Bank should ensure that such rating approvals and reviews are independently checked by IA 
at least annually.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-339 
(d)  
A Reporting Bank must ensure that every obligor, protection provider 
recognised for the purposes of calculating credit RWA, and facility, has its ratings refreshed 
at least on an annual basis.  
 
(e) 
A Reporting Bank must define clearly in its policies and procedures the required 
review frequency for each type of obligor, protection provider recognised for the purposes 
of calculating credit RWA, and facility. A Reporting Bank must ensure that the policies and 
procedures clearly articulate the types of obligors, protection providers, and facilities, that 
require more frequent reviews than on an annual basis. In particular, the Reporting Bank 
must subject higher risk obligors and problem exposures to more frequent reviews.  
 
(f) 
A Reporting Bank must initiate a rating review in a timely fashion if relevant 
and material information on any obligor, protection provider recognised for the purposes 
of calculating credit RWA, or facility, emerges.  
 
 
4.4 
 
Integrity of Process for Assigning Retail Exposures to Pools 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must assign a retail exposure to a pool of exposures based 
on available information on that exposure at the time of assignment.  
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must review the loss characteristics and delinquency status 
of each risk pool at least on an annual basis. In order to ensure that retail exposures 
continue to be assigned to the correct pools and generate consistent and predictive 
estimates of IRBA parameters, a Reporting Bank must review the status of individual 
obligors within each pool and continually monitor the risk characteristics of exposures of 
every pool and migrate exposures from one pool to another, based on updated information 
on risk drivers gathered by the Reporting Bank as part of its monitoring process.     
 
(c) 
For the purposes of paragraph 4.4(a) and (b) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank 
must – 
 
(i)  
in the process of segmenting exposures, use risk drivers that best reflect 
the risk of an exposure and are consistent with risk measures used for 
credit risk management; and  
 
(ii)  ensure that risk driver information499 is sufficiently accurate and timely to 
track changes in underlying credit quality and to migrate exposures 
between risk pools. The Reporting Bank must – 
 
(A) clearly articulate its operational processes for monitoring and 
updating of information on risk drivers and for migrating exposures 
between risk pools; and 
 
 
499 
The Authority recognises that the benefit of more frequent information updates needs to be balanced 
against the incremental costs of such updates. However, a Reporting Bank should ensure that relevant 
information is updated if more frequent updates of risk drivers enable a Reporting Bank to derive more 
predictive estimates of IRBA parameters, especially if the potential impact on the calculation of regulatory 
capital adequacy requirements arising from low frequency of information updates is large. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-340 
(B) clearly articulate the risk drivers to be updated, as well as the 
frequency of such updates, for each product type or asset sub-
class.500  
 
 
4.5 
Overrides for all Exposure Types  
 
(a) 
For rating assignments based exclusively or partly on expert judgement, a 
Reporting Bank must clearly articulate in its credit policies whether it allows for the outputs 
of the rating process to be overridden. The Reporting Bank must ensure that its credit 
policies at least articulate – 
 
(i)  
the circumstances under which such overrides may be used and the 
implications such overrides would have on the mapping process of the 
Reporting Bank should the Reporting Bank use any of the technique under 
paragraph 5.4(d)(iii) of this Annex to derive estimates of PD; 
 
(ii)  the extent of overrides allowed;  
 
(iii)  the persons responsible for approving these overrides and the 
documentation that is required for supporting the overrides; 
 
(iv) the process for identifying overrides and separately tracking their 
performance501; and   
 
(v)  the procedures to ensure that the credit approver(s) of the Reporting Bank 
is informed of any overrides made and the reasons for the overrides, at 
the point of credit approval and periodic rating reviews.   
 
(b) 
For rating assignments where statistical models play a role (or in combination 
with expert judgement), a Reporting Bank must, in addition to meeting the standards in 
paragraph 4.5(a)(i) to (v) of this Annex, also have a process to monitor instances where 
certain variables used in the statistical models were excluded or altered. 
 
 
4.6 
Maintenance of Key Obligor and Facility Characteristics for All Exposure 
Types 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must collect and retain reliable information on key obligor and 
facility characteristics at the individual exposure level. A Reporting Bank must also collect 
and retain data on aspects of their internal ratings as required under Part XI. A Reporting 
 
500  
To ensure that the segmentation system continues to maintain meaningful differentiation of risk, a 
Reporting Bank should – 
(i) institute clear policies to define the criteria for reviewing and modifying its process of segmenting 
exposures; 
(ii) review its criteria and process of segmenting exposures at least on an annual basis;   
(iii) document changes, as well as justifications for the changes, to its criteria and process for segmenting 
exposures to ensure consistency in the Reporting Bank’s criteria and process over time and obtain 
historically comparable measurements of estimates of IRBA parameters; and 
(iv) assess its approach to updating information on risk drivers and migrating exposures as part of the 
validation of the segmentation process. 
501 
This should include, but is not limited to, validation of the performance of both the overridden ratings and 
the ratings after overrides. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

Bank must have an effective process to obtain and update relevant and material 
information on –  
 
(i)  
the financial condition of all obligors and all protection providers 
recognised for the purposes of calculating credit RWA; and 
 
(ii)  facility characteristics (including the condition of collateral secured against 
a facility) that affect LGD and EAD estimates.  
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that key obligor and facility characteristics 
collected and retained for the purposes of paragraph 4.6(a) of this Annex include those 
that support assignment of obligor and facility grades or could significantly affect 
underwriting decisions.502 A Reporting Bank must submit to the Authority the key obligor 
and facility characteristics, rating histories and estimates of IRBA parameters, upon 
request by the Authority.   
  
 
4.7 
Maintenance of Rating Histories and Estimates of IRBA Parameters for 
Wholesale Exposures  
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must maintain obligor rating histories on every obligor and 
protection provider recognised for the purposes of calculating credit RWA, including – 
 
(i)  
the ratings that have been assigned since the obligor or protection 
provider was first assigned to an internal grade (history of rating 
migrations), and person or model responsible; 
 
(ii)  the dates that such ratings were assigned; 
 
(iii)  the methodology used to assign the ratings, including information on 
whether a statistical model has played a role in the rating assignment; 
 
(iv)  key characteristics used to assign the ratings; and 
 
(v)  in the case where an expert judgement rating system was used or when 
an override was approved, the persons responsible for applying the 
judgement or approving the override.  
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must maintain information on the obligors and facilities that 
have defaulted, including the timing and circumstances of default.  
 
 
502  
A Reporting Bank should ensure that data collected are sufficiently detailed and retained for an adequate 
period of time to allow reallocation of obligors and facilities to grades, including refinements of rating 
systems to achieve finer segregations of obligors and facilities. Examples of key obligor and facility 
characteristics that should be collected and retained include – 
(i) credit scores from statistical rating models; 
(ii) qualitative factors that affect rating assignment.  
(iii) type of collateral secured against an exposure; 
(iv) facility amount;  
(v) key financial ratios; and  
(vi) ongoing characteristics that could significantly affect account management decisions, for example, 
refreshed credit scores, payment history, prepayment, and past instances of default. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-342 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must maintain PD estimates and realised default rates 
associated with each rating grade and ratings migration in order to track the predictive 
power of the obligor rating system.  
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank adopting the A-IRBA must also maintain – 
 
(i) 
a complete history of LGD and EAD estimates associated with each facility, 
and person or model responsible; 
 
(ii) 
key data used to derive the LGD and EAD estimates; 
 
(iii) the methodologies used to derive the LGD and EAD estimates; 
 
(iv) in the case where expert judgement was applied or when an override was 
approved in estimates of IRBA parameters, the person responsible for 
applying the judgement or approving the override;  
 
(v) 
the components of economic losses for each defaulted exposure, including 
– 
 
(A) the amounts recovered; 
 
(B) the source of recovery503; 
 
(C) the time period required for recovery;  
 
(D) the opportunity costs; and 
 
(E) 
the administrative costs associated with recovery; and 
 
(vi)  the LGD and EAD estimates, and the realised LGD and EAD, associated 
with each defaulted exposure.  
 
(e) 
A Reporting Bank adopting the A-IRBA and that reflects the credit risk mitigating 
effects of credit protection by adjusting LGD pursuant to Division 4 of Part VII must 
maintain data on the LGD of the facility before and after evaluation of the effects of the 
credit protection.  
 
(f)  
A Reporting Bank adopting the F-IRBA or the supervisory slotting criteria for 
the SL and HVCRE asset sub-classes must retain data on loss and recovery experience for 
the exposures.  
 
 
4.8 
Maintenance of Rating Histories and Estimates of IRBA Parameters for 
Retail Exposures 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must maintain – 
 
(i) 
information on risk drivers;  
 
 
503  
For example, collateral, liquidation proceeds or enforcement of guarantees. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-343 
(ii)  the methodology and data (including data on obligor and transaction risk 
characteristics used either directly or through use of a model, and data on 
delinquency) used in the process of allocating exposures to pools; and  
 
(iii)  a complete history of the PD, LGD and EAD estimates associated with each 
pool of exposures. 
 
(b) 
For every defaulted exposure, a Reporting Bank must maintain – 
 
(i)  
the history of assignments of that exposure to pools over the one-year 
period prior to the point of default;  
 
(ii)  the PD, LGD and EAD estimates for the pools to which the exposure was 
assigned over the one-year period prior to the point of default; and 
 
(iii)  the realised LGD and EAD for that exposure.  
 
 
Section 5: Parameterisation Process 
 
 
5.1 
Definitions of IRBA Parameters  
 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank adopting IRBA must adopt the definitions of default, PD, LGD 
and EAD in Annexes 7L and 7U.  
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank which fails to adopt the definitions of LGD or EAD specified in 
Annex 7U, or fails to meet the requirements specified in Annex 7W or paragraphs 5.6 to 
5.7 of this Annex, for wholesale exposures must use the supervisory estimates of these 
parameters in accordance with Divisions 2 and 4 of Part VII.  
 
 
5.2 
 
Reference Data Used in Parameterisation Process 
 
(a)  
A Reporting Bank must comply with the requirements in Annex 7W. Whether a 
Reporting Bank uses internal data or data from external sources (including pooled data) 
for the parameterisation process, it must ensure that the historical default and loss 
experiences embodied in the reference data set is of sufficient breadth, i.e. the reference 
data set must include relevant default and loss experiences derived from periods of 
economic downturns. The Reporting Bank must demonstrate that its internal estimates of 
PD, LGD and EAD are representative of long run experience.504 
 
(b) 
For the purposes of meeting paragraph 5.2(a) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank 
must not omit data from any periods with relatively higher rates of default and loss rates 
from the reference data set. A Reporting Bank which does not utilise a reference data set 
that covers a complete economic cycle must apply a greater degree of conservatism in its 
parameterisation process. In this respect, the Reporting Bank must also take into 
consideration the need for an additional degree of conservatism in view of the standards 
on deriving estimates of PD, LGD and EAD in paragraphs 5.3 to 5.7 of this Annex.  
 
504  
A Reporting Bank should ensure that the reference data set covers at least one complete economic cycle 
with a representative mix of good and bad years.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-344 
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the reference data set for EAD estimates is 
not capped to the principal amount outstanding or facility limits. A Reporting Bank must 
ensure that accrued interest, other due payments and limit excesses are included in the 
reference data set.  
 
 
Data Representativeness and Relevance 
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure the ongoing applicability of the statistical 
inferences which are grounded on the reference data set. To this end, a Reporting Bank 
must continually ensure the representativeness of the reference data set by ensuring 
broad comparability between –  
 
(i) 
the population of exposures represented in the reference data set with the 
Reporting Bank’s current credit exposures; 
 
(ii)  the definitions of default and IRBA parameters in use when the reference 
data set was generated with the definitions of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(iii) lending standards in use when the reference data set was generated with 
the Reporting Bank’s lending standards; and 
 
(iv) other applicable characteristics that could affect estimates of IRBA 
parameters when the reference data set was generated with the 
characteristics that are in occurrence. The Reporting Bank must 
demonstrate that economic or market conditions that underlie the 
reference data set are relevant to current and foreseeable economic or 
market conditions. 
 
(e) 
Where the reference data set includes external data (including legacy data from 
different institutions after a business combination), the Reporting Bank must exercise 
greater care in ensuring the representativeness of the reference data set. In particular, 
the Reporting Bank must demonstrate that – 
 
(i)  
the external data is representative of the portfolio for which the external 
data is used;  
 
(ii)  it has sufficient understanding of the data collection process; 
 
(iii) the external data includes periods of economic downturns; and  
 
(iv) the external data broadly adheres to the definitions of default and IRBA 
parameters for the portfolio.  
 
(f) 
In deriving estimates of PD, and where relevant, LGD and EAD, where a 
Reporting Bank uses external data available to it that is not itself consistent with the 
definition of default in Annex 7L, or the definition of PD, LGD and EAD in Annex 7U, the 
Reporting Bank must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that appropriate 
adjustments to the data are made to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of 
default in Annex 7L, and the definition of PD, LGD, and EAD in Annex 7U, subject to the 
Reporting Bank meeting the requirements in paragraph 5.2(e) of this Annex.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-345 
 
(g) 
In deriving estimates of PD, and where relevant, LGD and EAD, where a 
Reporting Bank uses any internal data based on periods prior to 1 January 2008 that is 
not itself consistent with the definition of default in Annex 7L, or the definition of PD, LGD 
and EAD in Annex 7U, the Reporting Bank must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Authority that appropriate adjustments to the data are made to achieve broad equivalence 
with the definition of default in Annex 7L, and the definition of PD, LGD, and EAD in Annex 
7U, subject to the Reporting Bank meeting the requirements in paragraph 5.2(e) of this 
Annex.  
 
(h) 
For internal data based on periods from 1 January 2008 onwards that is used 
by a Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank must ensure that internal data and any pooled 
data used by the Reporting Bank to derive estimates of IRBA parameters is consistent with 
the definition of default in Annex 7L, and the definition of PD, LGD and EAD in Annex 7U.   
 
 
Size of Reference Data Set 
 
(i) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the number of exposures and default 
observations, and the data period in the reference data set is sufficient to provide the 
Reporting Bank with confidence in the accuracy and robustness of its estimates of IRBA 
parameters.   
 
 
5.3 
Standards on Parameterisation Process 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the estimates of IRBA parameters are 
grounded in historical and empirical evidence, and not based purely on subjective or 
judgemental considerations505. A Reporting Bank must promptly take into account the 
changes in lending practice or the process for pursuing recoveries over the observation 
period in its parameterisation process.  
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must not mechanically calculate its estimates of IRBA 
parameters from historical losses506. The Reporting Bank must take into account the 
implications of technical advances deployed in banking, new data and other information, 
as such information becomes available.   
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the parameterisation process of a Reporting 
Bank incorporates all relevant, material and available data, information and methods 
which could influence its view and outlook on credit risks.  
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank must use the definition of default under Annex 7L for deriving 
estimates of PD, and where relevant LGD and EAD.  
 
 
505  
A Reporting Bank should ensure that its parameterisation process is oriented to the derivation of forward-
looking, consistent and predictive estimates of IRBA parameters. A Reporting Bank should demonstrate an 
intention to characterise the future risk of losses arising from its portfolios.  
506  
The Reporting Bank should assess the relevance of the historical loss experiences for the purposes of 
deriving estimates of IRBA parameters, and be cognisant that historical losses are the outcome of a 
combination of contextual circumstances which may not be repeated in the future.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-346 
(e) 
A Reporting Bank must consider judiciously the relevance of representative 
external data and other information sources for enhancing the breadth of experience of its 
reference data set.507  
 
(f) 
Judgemental inputs may form part of the parameterisation process of a 
Reporting Bank. Judgemental input includes any adjustment of the results derived from 
the parameterisation process or observed from the reference data set.508   
 
(g) 
A Reporting Bank must not use judgemental input to reduce its estimates of 
IRBA parameters, unless the judgemental input has been subjected to a high degree of 
scrutiny within the Reporting Bank.509  
 
(h) 
A Reporting Bank must review its estimates of IRBA parameters when new 
information that may affect the IRBA parameters comes to light but in any case at least 
annually 510. Upon completion of the review of the estimates of IRBA parameters, a 
Reporting Bank must document – 
 
(i)  
the data, information and considerations which were taken into account in 
deriving the PD, LGD and EAD estimates. If a Reporting Bank has used 
multiple parameterisation processes to derive estimates of IRBA 
parameters for any obligor or facility (or pool of exposures), it must 
document the data, information and considerations which were taken into 
account in deriving each set of estimates; 
 
(ii)  its justification for its estimates of PD, LGD and EAD used for calculating 
regulatory capital requirements under IRBA; and 
 
(iii)  a description of the statistical precision of the PD, LGD and EAD estimates 
used for calculating regulatory capital requirements under IRBA. This 
standard could be fulfilled by a description of the potential errors 
associated with the estimates of IRBA parameters by the unit responsible 
for deriving the estimates.   
 
(i)  
A Reporting Bank must add to its estimates of IRBA parameters a margin of 
conservatism that is related to the likely range of errors. This is to account for potential 
uncertainties and weaknesses in the parameterisation process, as such potential 
uncertainties and weaknesses could lead to unpredictable errors in its estimates of IRBA 
parameters. A Reporting Bank must apply a greater margin of conservatism if the data, 
information and methods used in the parameterisation process do not fully take into 
 
507  
A Reporting Bank should take into account external data on defaults and losses, to the extent that they are 
reliable and relevant, in deriving forward-looking estimates of IRBA parameters, particularly if internal 
default or loss experience is limited.  
508  
For example, a Reporting Bank would be considered to have used judgemental inputs if it has “smoothed” 
its observed PDs, by judgementally raising the PD of a rating grade to ensure that there is a monotonic 
relationship between rating grades and PDs. 
509  
A Reporting Bank should conduct ex-post evaluations of the contribution of such judgemental input to the 
derivation of consistent and predictive estimates of IRBA parameters. A Reporting Bank should investigate 
the causes of persistent failures of judgemental input to improve the consistency and predictiveness of 
estimates of IRBA parameters.  
510  
A Reporting Bank should, at a regular interval, examine the justifications of its estimates of IRBA 
parameters, particularly the judgemental input used, with the view to improving its parameterisation 
processes. Particular attention should be given to new business lines or portfolios in which the mix of 
obligors is believed to have changed substantially.   


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-347 
account all relevant considerations and may potentially result in a larger range of 
unpredictable errors.  
 
(j) 
A Reporting Bank must continually review its parameterisation process to 
incorporate new data, analytical techniques, and evolving industry practice. 
 
(k) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the estimation technique used by it to derive 
estimates of IRBA parameters for any obligor and facility (or pool of exposures) performs 
well in out-of-sample tests.  
 
 
5.4 
 
Standards on Estimation of PD for Wholesale Exposures 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must estimate a PD for each internal obligor grade for each 
rating system used for wholesale exposures. To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank is not 
required to produce its own estimates of PD for exposures within the SL asset sub-class 
and the HVCRE asset sub-class, where the Reporting Bank is using the supervisory slotting 
criteria set out in Sub-division 13 of Division 4 of Part VII. 
 
(b)  
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the PD estimate for any obligor grade 
reflects the expectation of the Reporting Bank of the “long-run average” of one-year 
default rates for obligors categorised in that grade.511   
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must not estimate its long-run average PD purely by a 
mechanical calculation of its historical default rates without supporting analysis, even if 
the Reporting Bank has representative and consistent historical default experience 
covering one or more economic cycles. A Reporting Bank must recognise the importance 
of judgemental considerations in combining results of techniques and in making 
adjustments for limitations of techniques and information. 
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank must use information and techniques512 that allow it to most 
appropriately take account of the long-run experience of the Reporting Bank to derive a 
long-run average estimate of PD for each rating grade. The Reporting Bank must estimate 
a PD for each rating grade based on the observed historical average one-year default rate 
that is a simple average based on number of obligors (i.e. count-weighted). The Reporting 
Bank must not use other weighting approaches, including weighting by exposure amount. 
The following are 4 specific techniques that a Reporting Bank may use and some of the 
attendant issues arising from their use513:   
 
511  
A Reporting Bank should ensure that the “long-run average” reflect the expected average default 
experience for that grade (based on reference data set which covers at least one complete economic cycle 
with a representative mix of good and bad years). A Reporting Bank which has not fully incorporated an 
assessment of the vulnerability of the obligor to adverse economic conditions or unexpected events in its 
rating assignments should incorporate such an assessment in its process of deriving PD estimates.  
512  
A Reporting Bank may have a primary technique and may use other techniques as a point of comparison 
and potential adjustment.   
513  
A Reporting Bank should consider alternative techniques for deriving a PD estimate for portfolios where 
there are insignificant incidences of past representative defaults to make meaningful statistical inferences. 
For example, a Reporting Bank may use one or more of the following:  
(a)  use pooled data, external data or market measures of risk to complement internal loss data;  
(b)  combine internal portfolio segments with similar characteristics, subject to the fulfilment of other 
standards in this Annex;  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-348 
 
(i) 
A Reporting Bank uses data based on internal default experiences for 
deriving PD estimates. When using this technique, the Reporting Bank 
must demonstrate that the PD estimates have taken into account 
underwriting standards and potential differences due to changes in the 
definition of default, calculation of PD, underwriting standards, rating 
systems, and the profile of the population of exposures of the Reporting 
Bank over time. Where only limited internal default data are available, or 
if changes have rendered historical internal default rates less 
representative, a Reporting Bank must add a greater margin of 
conservatism in its estimate of PD;  
 
(ii) 
A Reporting Bank uses data based on internal default experiences and 
data pooled across banks for deriving PD estimates. When using this 
technique, the Reporting Bank must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Authority that the internal rating systems and criteria of other banks 
contributing to the pool are comparable with that of the Reporting Bank. 
The Reporting Bank must, in addition to observing paragraph 5.4(d)(i) of 
this Annex, properly account for differences in definition of default, 
calculation of PD, underwriting standards, rating systems, and the profile 
of the population of exposures across the banks contributing to the data 
pool. Where differences across banks contributing to the data pool are 
significant, a Reporting Bank must add a greater margin of conservatism 
in its estimate of PD; 
 
(iii) A Reporting Bank associates or maps its internal grades to the rating scale 
used by an ECAI or similar institution and then attributes the default rates 
observed for the ECAI’s grades to the grades of the Reporting Bank. A 
Reporting Bank must ensure that, where such a technique is used, the 
mappings of the Reporting Bank are based on a comparison of internal 
rating criteria with the criteria used by the ECAI and on a comparison of 
the internal and external ratings of any common obligors. The ECAI’s 
criteria must be oriented to the risk of the obligor and not reflect 
transaction characteristics. The Reporting Bank must properly account for 
differences in definition of default, calculation of PD, underwriting 
standards (where applicable), rating systems, and the profile of the 
population of exposures between itself and the ECAI to prevent biases or 
inconsistencies in the mapping process and underlying data. The Reporting 
Bank must document the basis for the mapping; 
 
 
 
(c)  combine different rating categories and analyse PDs for the combined category. For example, a 
Reporting Bank using a rating system that maps to the rating categories of an ECAI might find it useful 
to combine AAA, AA and A-rated credits; 
(d)  use the upper bound of the PD estimate as an input to the formula for risk-weighted assets for those 
portfolios where the PD estimate itself is deemed to be too unreliable to warrant direct inclusion in 
capital adequacy calculations;  
(e)  derive PD estimates from data with a horizon that is different from one year. Where defaults are spread 
out over several years, a Reporting Bank may calculate a multi-year cumulative PD and then annualise 
the resulting figure. This cumulative PD should be calculated by taking into account rating migrations 
over the horizon. Where intra-year rating migrations contain additional information, these migrations 
could be analysed as separate rating movements in order to infer PDs, which may be especially useful 
for the higher-quality rating grades. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-349 
(iv) A Reporting Bank uses a simple average of default-probability estimates 
for individual obligors in a given grade where such estimates are drawn 
from statistical default prediction models. When using this technique, the 
Reporting Bank must meet the standards specified in paragraph 3.10 of 
this Annex, and ensure that the definitions and exposures used to 
construct such models are representative of the credit exposures of a 
Reporting Bank and that the data covers at least one economic cycle.  
 
 
5.5 
 
Standards on Estimation of PD for Retail Exposures 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must estimate a PD for each pool of retail exposures.514  
 
(b)  
A Reporting Bank must rely on internal default data as the primary source of 
information for estimating PD given that the Reporting Bank is unlikely to find 
representative external default data for all of its pools of exposures.     
 
(c) 
Despite paragraph 5.5(b) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank may use external 
data or statistical models provided – 
 
(i)  it does not omit any available and relevant internal data source selectively; 
 
(ii) 
it has verified that there is a strong link between its process of assigning 
exposures to a pool and the process used by the external data source; 
and 
 
(iii) it has verified that the exposures composing the external data are 
representative of the internal risk profile of its exposures. 
 
 
5.6  
 
Standards on Estimation of LGD515  
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank adopting the A-IRBA or the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset 
class must estimate an LGD for each facility or retail pool that aims to reflect economic 
downturn conditions. Appropriate downturn conditions for any IRBA asset sub-class are 
those in which the relevant drivers of default rates are consistent with conditions where 
credit losses for that IRBA asset sub-class are expected to be substantially higher than 
average. In addition, a Reporting Bank must take into account the potential for the LGD 
estimate of a facility to be higher than the long-run default-weighted average loss rate 
given default, during a period when credit losses are substantially higher than average. A 
Reporting Bank must incorporate the cyclical variability in loss severities in LGD estimates 
for facilities where this is relevant.516   
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must take into account material discount effects and material 
direct and indirect costs associated with collecting on an exposure to estimate economic 
 
514 
A Reporting Bank should not derive PD and LGD estimates for any retail pool based on an estimate of the 
expected long-run loss rate for that retail pool.  
515  
A Reporting Bank should also meet the guidelines in Annex 7Z on LGD estimates. 
516  
For this purpose, a Reporting Bank may make reference to averages of loss severities observed during 
periods of high credit losses or forecasts based on appropriately conservative assumptions, or other similar 
methods. Appropriate estimates of LGD during periods of high credit losses may be formed using either 
internal or external data.   


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-350 
loss, for the purposes of calculating historical LGDs and deriving forward-looking estimates 
of LGDs. A Reporting Bank must not simply measure the loss recorded in accounting 
records, but must be able to compare accounting and economic losses. 
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank adopting the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class must rely on 
internal default data as the primary source of information for estimating LGD.517 
 
(d) 
The Reporting Bank must consider the potential impact of adverse dependencies 
between default and recovery rates.  
 
(e) 
A Reporting Bank must establish internal policies on the determinants of high 
dependency between the risk of the obligor and the collateral or collateral provider, 
including the existence of a legal connection or economic considerations. The Reporting 
Bank must ensure that these policies also determine the actions to take when there is a 
significant dependency, with respect to terms of business, exposure and limit 
measurement, capital requirements and other forms of risk mitigation518. In such cases, 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the dependence is addressed in a conservative 
manner. A Reporting Bank must consider any currency mismatch between the underlying 
obligation and the collateral and ensure that they are treated conservatively in the 
Reporting Bank’s assessment and process of deriving LGD estimates.  
 
(f)  
A Reporting Bank must derive LGD estimates on the basis of historical recovery 
rates and not solely based on the collateral’s estimated market value in order to account 
for the potential inability of the Reporting Bank to gain control of collateral and liquidate 
it expeditiously. If internal historical recovery rates are insufficient for a Reporting Bank 
to make meaningful statistical inferences, the Reporting Bank may consider whether 
external data would be appropriate. To the extent that LGD estimates take into account 
the existence of collateral, a Reporting Bank must establish internal requirements for 
collateral management, operational procedures, legal certainty and risk management 
processes that are at least consistent with the requirements set out in Annex 7H.   
 
(g)  
A Reporting Bank must ensure that any adjustment to its LGD estimates, to 
take into account its own workout and collection expertise, is made in consultation with 
the Authority. A Reporting Bank must ensure that such adjustments are conservative until 
it has sufficient internal empirical evidence of the impact of its expertise on recovery rates.   
    
(h) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the estimate of the LGD associated with any 
facility grade or retail pool of a Reporting Bank is not be less than the long-run default 
weighted average loss rate given default calculated based on the average economic loss 
of all observed defaults within the data source for that type of facility or retail pool. 
 
(i) 
Given the possibility of recognising additional, unexpected losses during the 
recovery period as realised losses can at times systematically exceed expected levels519, 
a Reporting Bank must construct its best estimates of the expected loss for each defaulted 
exposure based on current economic circumstances and facility status. The amount, if any, 
by which the LGD on a defaulted exposure is greater than the best estimate of expected 
loss on that exposure, represents the capital requirement for that exposure as set out in 
 
517  
This is because the Reporting Bank is unlikely to find representative external default data for all of its pools 
of exposures.   
518  
For example, through the use of guarantees or credit derivatives. 
519  
The LGD assigned to a defaulted asset should reflect the possibility that the Reporting Bank has to recognise 
additional, unexpected losses during the recovery period.   


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-351 
paragraph 7.4.122. If the sum of specific allowances and partial write-offs on a defaulted 
exposure is greater than the best estimate of expected loss on that exposure, the 
Reporting Bank has to provide to the Authority the justification for such difference.    
 
 
5.7 
Standards on Estimation of EAD520  
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank adopting the A-IRBA or the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset 
class must estimate EAD at no less than the current drawn amount, subject to recognising 
the effects of on-balance sheet netting, and have procedures in place for the estimation 
of EAD for off-balance sheet items (excluding derivatives). The Reporting Bank must 
ensure that such procedures specify the estimates of EAD to be used for each facility type. 
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the estimates of EAD of a Reporting Bank 
reflect the possibility of additional drawings by the obligor up to and after the time a default 
event is triggered. Where estimates of EAD differ by facility type, a Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the delineation of these facilities is clear and unambiguous. For exposures in 
the IRBA retail asset class with uncertain future drawdown521, a Reporting Bank must take 
into account its history and expectation of additional drawings prior to default in its overall 
calibration of loss estimates.   
 
(c)  
A Reporting Bank adopting the A-IRBA or the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset 
class must estimate an EAD for each facility or pool of exposures. The Reporting Bank 
must ensure that the EAD estimate for each facility or pool of exposures is an estimate of 
the long-run default-weighted average EAD (and not a time-weighted average) for similar 
facilities or pool of exposures over a sufficiently long period of time (including periods of 
stress), but with a margin of conservatism appropriate to the likely range of errors in the 
estimate. If a positive correlation can reasonably be expected between the default 
frequency and the magnitude of EAD, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the EAD 
estimate incorporates a larger margin of conservatism.  
 
(d) 
For the purposes of meeting the standards in paragraph 5.7(c) of this Annex, a 
Reporting Bank must use EAD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn 
for exposures for which EAD estimates are volatile over the economic cycle, if EAD 
estimates appropriate in an economic downturn are more conservative than the long-run 
average EAD estimates.522,523  
 
(e) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the process for deriving EAD estimates – 
 
(i) 
is plausible and intuitive; 
 
520  
A Reporting Bank should also meet the guidelines in Annex 7Z on EAD estimates. 
521  
For example, credit cards. 
522  
For example, a Reporting Bank may achieve this by – 
(i)  considering the cyclical nature, if any, of the drivers of EAD models for a Reporting Bank which is using 
such models to estimate EAD; 
(ii)  examining the impact of previous recession(s) on EAD estimates based on historical internal data; 
(iii)  applying conservatism in EAD estimates if historical internal data does not cover recessionary 
period(s); or 
(iv) making conservative use of external data if historical internal data is insufficient. 
523  
Moreover, where a Reporting Bank bases its EAD estimates on alternative measures of central tendency 
(such as the median or a higher percentile estimate) or only on downturn data, it should explicitly confirm 
that the basic downturn requirement of the framework is met, i.e. the Reporting Bank’s estimates do not 
fall below a (conservative) estimate of the long-run default-weighted average EAD for similar facilities.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-352 
 
(ii)  takes into account the effects of material drivers of EAD; 
 
(iii) takes into account all relevant and material information; and 
 
(iv) is supported by credible internal analysis by the Reporting Bank.  
 
(f) 
A Reporting Bank adopting the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class must rely on 
internal default data as the primary source of information for estimating EAD524. 
 
(g) 
A Reporting Bank must be able to provide a breakdown of its EAD experience 
by the factors which the internal analysis in paragraph 5.7(e) of this Annex has uncovered 
as drivers of EAD.  
 
(h) 
A Reporting Bank must review its estimates of EAD for each facility type or pool 
of exposures when material new information comes to light and at least on an annual basis.   
 
(i) 
For the purposes of meeting the standard in paragraph 5.7(e)(ii) of this Annex, 
a Reporting Bank must consider its specific policies and strategies adopted in respect of 
account monitoring and payment processing. The Reporting Bank must also consider its 
ability and willingness to prevent further drawings in circumstances short of payment 
default, including covenant violations or other technical default events.  
 
(j) 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(i)  
have adequate systems and procedures in place to monitor facility 
amounts, current outstanding balances against committed lines and 
changes in outstanding balances per obligor and per grade; and  
 
(ii)  be able to monitor outstanding balances on a daily basis.  
 
(k) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its EAD estimates are developed using a 
12-month fixed-horizon approach (i.e. for each observation in the reference data set, 
default outcomes must be linked to relevant obligor and facility characteristics 12 months 
prior to default). 
 
 
5.8 
Standards on Reporting Banks Adopting the A-IRBA or the IRBA for the 
IRBA Retail Asset Class for Assessing Effect of Credit Protection 
 
Protection Providers Recognised for the Purposes of Calculating Credit RWA 
 
(a) 
Subject to sub-paragraphs (c) and (d), a Reporting Bank adopting the A-IRBA 
or the IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class is not subject to any restrictions on the types 
of protection providers for the purposes of recognising the effect of credit protection, 
provided that the requirements in Annex 7H, and in addition, if the credit protection is 
through a guarantee, all of the following conditions, are met: 
 
(i)  
the guarantee is in writing and unconditional; 
 
524  
This is because the Reporting Bank is unlikely to find representative external default data for all of its pools 
of exposures. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-353 
 
(ii)  the guarantee is non-cancellable on the part of the guarantor;  
 
(iii)  the guarantee will be in force until the obligation is satisfied in full (to the 
extent of the amount and tenor of the guarantee);  
 
(iv) the guarantee is legally enforceable against the guarantor in a country or 
jurisdiction where the guarantor has assets to attach and enforce a 
judgement. 
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must have clearly specified criteria for the types of protection 
providers it will recognise for regulatory capital purposes. 
 
(c) 
In the case of eligible credit protection where a Reporting Bank applies the 
SA(CR) to the covered portion of exposure in accordance with paragraph 7.4.110(a), the 
Reporting Bank must apply the scope of eligible protection providers under the SA(CR).   
 
(d) 
In the case of eligible credit protection where a Reporting Bank applies the F-
IRBA to the covered portion of exposure in accordance with paragraph 7.4.110(b), the 
Reporting Bank must apply the scope of eligible protection providers under the F-IRBA. 
 
 
Recognition of Guarantees through an Adjustment to Obligor or Facility Grade  
 
(e) 
A Reporting Bank using its own estimates of LGD may reflect the risk-mitigating 
effect of guarantees through an adjustment to PD or LGD estimates, provided this is done 
consistently both across types of guarantees and over time. For retail exposures, where 
guarantees exist, either in support of an individual exposure or a pool of exposures, a 
Reporting Bank may reflect the risk-reducing effect either through its estimates of PD or 
LGD. 
 
(f) 
A Reporting Bank must assign a obligor rating to both the obligor and all 
recognised guarantors at the outset and on an ongoing basis, and abide by all standards 
for assigning obligor ratings set out in this Annex, including the standards on the regular 
monitoring of the financial condition of the guarantor as well as its ability and willingness 
to honour its obligations. A Reporting Bank must retain all relevant information on the 
obligor absent of the guarantee and the guarantor, consistent with paragraph 4.7 of this 
Annex. In the case of retail exposures where guarantees exists, the Reporting Bank must 
also apply these requirements to the assignment of an exposure to a pool, and the 
estimation of PD.  
 
(g) 
A Reporting Bank must not derive an adjusted PD or LGD estimate for a 
guaranteed exposure such that the adjusted risk weight would be lower than that of a 
comparable, direct exposure to the guarantor. The Reporting Bank must not consider 
possible favourable effects of imperfect expected correlation between default events for 
the obligor and guarantor for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements 
in the rating criteria and rating processes. As such, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the 
adjusted risk weight does not reflect the risk mitigation of “double default”.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-354 
(h) 
A Reporting Bank must have clearly specified internal criteria for adjusting 
obligor grades or LGD estimates (or in the case of retail and eligible purchased receivables, 
the process of assigning exposures to pools) to reflect the impact of guarantees for 
regulatory capital purposes. A Reporting Bank must ensure that such criteria is as detailed 
as the criteria for assigning obligor or facility ratings and is consistent with the standards 
in Section 4 of this Annex.   
 
(i) 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the internal criteria at paragraph 5.8(h) 
of this Annex is plausible and intuitive, and addresses the guarantor’s ability and 
willingness to perform under the guarantee. The Reporting Bank must ensure the criteria 
addresses the likely timing of any payments and the degree to which the guarantor’s ability 
to perform under the guarantee is correlated with the obligor’s ability to repay. The 
Reporting Bank’s criteria must also consider the extent to which residual risk to the obligor 
remains525.  
 
(j) 
In adjusting obligor grades or LGD estimates (or in the case of exposures under 
the IRBA retail asset class, the process of assigning exposures to pools), a Reporting Bank 
must take all relevant available information into account.  
 
 
Recognition of Single-Name Credit Derivatives through an Adjustment to 
Obligor or Facility Grade  
 
(k) 
A Reporting Bank using its own estimates of LGD may reflect the risk-mitigating 
effect of single-name credit derivatives through an adjustment to PD or LGD estimates, 
subject to the following: 
 
(i)  
the standards for recognition under paragraph 5.8(a) to (j) of this Annex 
are met;  
 
(ii)  a Reporting Bank must ensure that the internal criteria used for assigning 
adjusted obligor grades or deriving LGD estimates (or in the case of 
exposures under the IRBA retail asset class, the process of assigning 
exposures to pools) for exposures hedged with credit derivatives – 
 
(A) requires that the asset on which the protection is based (the 
reference asset) is not different from the underlying asset, unless 
the requirements outlined in paragraph 5.3(k) of Annex 7H are 
complied with; and 
 
(B) addresses the payout structure of the credit derivative and 
conservatively assesses the impact this has on the level and timing 
of recoveries. The Reporting Bank’s internal criteria must also 
consider the extent to which other forms of residual risk remain for 
an exposure hedged with a single-name credit derivative.  
 
 
 
 
 
525  
For example, a currency mismatch between the guarantee and the underlying exposure.

Standards on Reporting Banks Adopting F-IRBA for the IRBA Wholesale  
Asset Class for Assessing Effect of Credit Protection 
 
(a) 
For the purposes of recognising the effect of credit protection for a Reporting 
Bank adopting the F-IRBA for the wholesale asset class, a Reporting Bank must comply 
with the requirements in paragraph 5.8 of this Annex, with the following exceptions:  
 
(i) 
a Reporting Bank must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
in accordance with paragraph 7.4.109;  
 
(ii) 
a Reporting Bank must limit the range of eligible protection providers and 
eligible credit protection in accordance with Annex 7H, and paragraph 
5.8(c) and (d) of this Annex.  
 
 
Section 6: Stress Tests 
 
 
6.1 
General Stress Tests  
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank adopting the IRBA must have in place sound and 
comprehensive stress testing processes for use in the assessment of its capital adequacy.  
The Reporting Bank must ensure that stress testing involves identifying possible events or 
future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on the 
Reporting Bank’s credit exposures and assessment of the Reporting Bank’s ability to 
withstand such changes.526   
 
 
6.2 
Credit Stress Test 
 
(a) 
In addition to the general stress tests described above, a Reporting Bank must 
specifically conduct regular (at least semi-annually, or more frequently if so directed by 
the Authority) credit risk stress tests to assess the effect of certain specific conditions on 
its IRBA regulatory capital requirements. The Reporting Bank must perform additional 
stress tests where it determines that the prevailing economic circumstances are such that 
the results of the last semi-annual stress test have become irrelevant. Despite the 
foregoing, the Authority may, from time to time, direct a Reporting Bank to conduct 
additional credit risk stress tests as the Authority considers necessary. The credit stress 
tests to be employed would be chosen by the Reporting Bank, subject to review by the 
 
526 
Examples of scenarios that could be used are –  
(i) economic or industry downturns;  
(ii) market risk events; and 
(iii) liquidity conditions.  
The 1998 Asian crisis and 2001 slowdown in the U.S. economy, in particular the electronics sector, are 
examples of historical events that may be used in developing stress scenarios. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-356 
Authority.527 The Reporting Bank must ensure that the credit stress tests to be conducted 
are meaningful and reasonably conservative. 528,529  
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank is not required to consider worst-case scenarios in the credit 
stress tests530,531.  
 
(c) 
Regardless of the approach used for stress testing, the Reporting Bank must 
incorporate all of the following sources of information: 
 
(i)  
the data of the Reporting Bank which includes the estimation of the ratings 
migration of at least some of its exposures; 
 
(ii) 
the impact of smaller deteriorations in the credit environment on the 
Reporting Bank’s ratings which may give some information on the likely 
effect of bigger, stress circumstances;  
 
(iii) the evidence of ratings migration in external ratings. This would include 
the Reporting Bank broadly matching its internal grades to rating 
categories of an ECAI.   
 
 
6.3 
Oversight of Stress Tests 
 
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and senior management approve 
and exercise effective oversight over its stress test process. The Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the Board or senior management, or both, regularly review the techniques, 
assumptions, results and effectiveness of the stress tests, as well as approve material 
changes to the stress test techniques and assumptions.  
 
(b) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management is actively involved in 
the process of designing stress tests, monitoring of results and drawing up plans for 
remedial actions.  
 
(c) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management also establishes 
comprehensive and adequate written policies and procedures, to be approved by the Board, 
on its stress test processes. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the documentation 
includes the objectives, techniques, assumptions, reporting requirements, remedial 
 
527 
The Authority may prescribe specific scenarios for stress testing, on top of the Reporting Bank’s own 
scenarios. 
528  
The stress tests should be consistent with the historical economic downturns experienced in Singapore and 
the regions, countries or jurisdictions in which the Reporting Bank has material exposures.  
529  
A Reporting Bank may develop different approaches to undertaking stress tests depending on its 
circumstances. A Reporting Bank should use a range of stress scenarios, which may include historical and 
hypothetical scenarios. The techniques, scenarios and risk factors used by a Reporting Bank in its stress 
tests should commensurate with the nature, size and complexity of its business. 
530  
A Reporting Bank should consider at least the effect of mild recession scenarios. At a minimum, the 
Reporting Bank should assess the impact of 2 consecutive quarters of zero growth on its PDs, LGDs and 
EADs. It is up to the Reporting Bank to determine how this mild recession scenario translates into 
movements in specific risk factors and how these risk factors affect its regulatory capital requirement. Any 
consideration by a Reporting Bank of its international diversification should be on a conservative basis.  
531  
The time horizon of the stress test should be consistent with the specifics of the scenario and should take 
into account the lag effect of an economic downturn on the Reporting Bank’s credit exposures. A Reporting 
Bank should also stress all material portfolios, including portfolios that contain the vast majority of its total 
exposures, under the IRBA.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-357 
actions, responsibilities and lines of authority for the stress tests of the Reporting Bank.  
In addition, the Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management regularly updates 
the Board on the stress test results as well as the remedial actions taken, in accordance 
with the stress test policy.    
 
(d) 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management includes all of the 
following key elements when implementing stress testing processes: 
 
(i)  
stress tests must include both quantitative and qualitative criteria. 
Quantitative criteria must identify plausible stress scenarios, preferably 
with different levels of severity, to which the Reporting Bank could be 
exposed. Qualitative criteria must emphasise that the 2 major goals of 
stress testing are to evaluate the capacity of the capital and earnings of 
the Reporting Bank to absorb potentially significant losses and to identify 
the steps that the Reporting Bank can take to manage its risk (including 
hedging and asset sales) and conserve capital;  
 
(ii)  stress scenarios must reflect specific risk characteristics of the portfolios 
of the Reporting Bank and take into consideration prevailing market 
conditions. All related risk factors must be identified and stressed; 
 
(iii) stress tests must be integrated into the Reporting Bank’s risk 
management system; 
 
(iv)  the Reporting Bank must put in place adequate information systems to 
support the stress test process;  
 
(v)  the review of the stress tests must take into account changes in portfolio 
characteristics and external conditions. The validity of the underlying 
assumptions must also be reviewed. Such reviews must be done at least 
once a year or more frequently if the portfolio or the environment changes 
significantly.

Annex 7Y 
 
GUIDELINES ON IRBA ROLLOUT PARAMETERS 
 
 
Section 1:  IRBA Coverage 
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank should observe the parameters set out in this Annex in its 
IRBA rollout.  
 
1.2 
Where a Reporting Bank adopts the IRBA for part of its exposures within the 
scope of paragraph 7.1.1(a) under the following IRBA asset sub-classes in sub-paragraph 
(a), (b), (d), (e), (f), (g) or (i), or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes in sub-paragraph 
(c) or (h), the Reporting Bank should extend its adoption of the IRBA across all exposures 
of the banking group which would fall within the respective IRBA asset sub-class or 
combination of IRBA asset sub-classes described in the same sub-paragraph:  
 
(a) 
sovereign asset sub-class;  
 
(b) 
bank asset sub-class;  
 
(c) 
general corporate asset sub-class and corporate small business asset sub-
class;  
 
(d) 
SL asset sub-class and HVCRE asset sub-class; 
 
(e) 
residential mortgage asset sub-class;   
 
(f) 
QRRE asset sub-class; 
 
(g) 
other retail exposures asset sub-class;  
 
(h) 
purchased corporate receivables asset sub-class and purchased corporate 
small business receivables asset sub-class;  
 
(i) 
purchased retail receivables asset sub-class.  
 
1.3  
The Authority recognises that a simultaneous rollout for an entire IRBA asset 
sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes across all business units of the banking 
group may not be practicable in all circumstances. As such, the Authority may permit 
phased rollouts in certain cases532. Despite this, the Authority will generally not permit a 
Reporting Bank to adopt the IRBA unless it is able to do so meaningfully from its IRBA 
adoption date.  
 
 
532  
For example, the Authority may permit a phased rollout of the IRBA (including a phased rollout of the A-
IRBA from the F-IRBA) for an IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes as set out in 
paragraph 1.2 of this Annex across business units in the same banking group. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-359 
1.4  
To minimise the risk of capital arbitrage, the Reporting Bank should ensure that 
– 
 
(a)  exposures falling within an IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA 
asset sub-classes set out in paragraph 1.2 of this Annex within a given 
country or jurisdiction transition to the IRBA simultaneously; and  
 
(b)  IRBA asset sub-classes or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes across 
countries or jurisdictions in which the Reporting Bank operates, where 
arbitrage opportunities may be created by a phased IRBA rollout, 
transition to the IRBA simultaneously. 
 
 
Section 2:  IRBA Rollout Plan 
 
2.1 
A Reporting Bank which has been permitted to rollout the IRBA in a phased 
manner should – 
 
(a)  provide reasonable assurances to the Authority that all remaining 
exposures within each IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset 
sub-classes set out in paragraph 1.2 of this Annex, except those that are 
permitted to be excluded from the IRBA, will be brought onto the IRBA 
steadily;  
 
(b)  complete its IRBA rollout for each IRBA asset sub-class or combination of 
IRBA asset sub-classes set out in paragraph 1.2 of this Annex across the 
entire banking group within 2 years of the IRBA adoption date for that 
IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA asset sub-classes, save in 
exceptional circumstances533; and 
 
(c) 
be able to demonstrate that its IRBA rollout plan is driven by the 
practicality and feasibility of moving to the IRBA, and not minimisation of 
its capital requirements. 
 
2.2 
On a continuing basis, the Reporting Bank should ensure that the percentage 
of exposures excluded from the IRBA in each IRBA asset sub-class or combination of IRBA 
asset sub-classes as set out in paragraph 1.2 of this Annex and calculated in accordance 
with paragraphs 7.4.33 to 7.4.36 does not exceed the following thresholds:  
 
(a)  20% for the following IRBA asset sub-classes or combination of IRBA asset 
sub-classes:  
 
(i)  sovereign asset sub-class;   
 
(ii)  bank asset sub-class; 
 
(iii) general corporate asset sub-class and corporate small business asset 
sub-class; 
 
(iv) SL asset sub-class and HVCRE asset sub-class;

Annex 7Z 
 
GUIDELINES ON LGD AND EAD ESTIMATES FOR ALL ASSET CLASSES 
 
 
Section 1:  LGD Estimates for a Reporting Bank Adopting the A-IRBA or the IRBA 
for the IRBA Retail Asset Class  
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank should have a rigorous and well documented process for 
assessing the effects, if any, of economic downturn conditions on recovery rates and for 
producing LGD estimates consistent with downturn conditions.  
 
1.2  
A Reporting Bank should identify downturn conditions at a granular level. Where 
recovery rates of exposures are sensitive to local economic conditions, a Reporting Bank 
should identify separate downturn conditions for each country or jurisdiction at the IRBA 
asset sub-class level. In those cases where a Reporting Bank is able to demonstrate that 
exposures in the same asset sub-class in different countries or jurisdictions exhibit strong 
co-movement in recovery rates, the Reporting Bank may group those countries or 
jurisdictions together for the purposes of defining downturn conditions. Where recovery 
rates of exposures are not sensitive to local economic conditions (e.g. exposures to 
internationally diversified obligors), a Reporting Bank may identify downturn conditions 
appropriate to the exposures, which may span national boundaries. 
 
1.3 
A Reporting Bank should, at a minimum, identify separate downturn conditions 
for each IRBA asset sub-class. The following examples are considered by the Authority as 
acceptable methods of identifying appropriate economic downturn conditions: 
 
(a) 
periods of negative GDP growth and high unemployment rates (for a well-
diversified wholesale portfolio); 
 
(b) 
periods in which observed historical default rates have been high for a 
portfolio of exposures that is representative of the Reporting Bank’s 
current portfolio;  
 
(c) 
periods where common risk drivers (e.g. collateral values) that influence 
default and recovery rates are expected to be distressed. 
 
1.4 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.6(b) of Annex 7X, a Reporting Bank should 
meet the following guidelines when estimating economic loss for the calculation of 
historical LGDs and deriving forward-looking estimates of LGD:  
 
(a) 
economic loss may be calculated using EAD, loss of principal, interest, and 
fees, and the present value of subsequent recoveries and related expenses 
discounted at a suitable rate. The Reporting Bank should discount the 
streams of recoveries received after a facility goes into default in order to 
compare the net present value of recovery streams as of a default date 
with a measure of EAD; 
 
(b) 
the discount rate used to calculate economic loss should reflect the costs 
of holding defaulted assets over a workout period, including an appropriate 
risk premium. In establishing an appropriate discount rate, the Reporting 
Bank should take into account the following: 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-362 
 
(i) 
when recovery streams are uncertain and involve risks which cannot 
be diversified away, net present value calculations should reflect the 
time value of money and risk premiums appropriate to such risks. In 
establishing appropriate risk premiums for the estimation of LGDs 
consistent with economic downturn conditions, the Reporting Bank 
should focus on the uncertainties in recovery cash flows associated 
with defaults which arise during economic downturn conditions;  
 
(ii) 
when there is no uncertainty in recovery streams (e.g. recoveries 
derived from cash collateral), net present value calculations need 
only reflect the time value of money, and a risk-free discount rate 
may be appropriate; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank may estimate the present values of recovery rates    
by – 
 
(i) 
discounting the stream of recoveries and the stream of workout costs 
by a risk-adjusted discount rate which is the sum of the risk-free rate 
and a spread appropriate for the risk of the recovery and workout 
cost cash flows; 
 
(ii) 
converting the stream of recoveries and the stream of workout costs 
to certainty-equivalent cash flows534 and discounting these by the 
risk-free rate; or 
 
(iii) using a combination of adjustments to the discount rate and the 
stream of recoveries and the stream of workout costs which are 
consistent with sub-paragraphs (c)(i) and (c)(ii)535; 
 
(d) 
workout costs which can be clearly attributed to certain facilities or types 
of facilities should be reflected in the LGD assignments of the Reporting 
Bank for those exposures. When such allocation is not practical, the 
Reporting Bank may assign those costs using factors based on broad 
averages. The allocation of recovery costs may require judgement, but the 
process should be carefully designed to ensure that all true recovery costs 
are reasonably allocated; 
 
(e) 
if a Reporting Bank chooses to close the period of observation before final 
resolution of the facility, for example, at a point in time when most costs 
have been incurred and when recoveries are substantially complete, it 
should have a well-founded process for estimating the additional costs and 
recoveries which would likely occur beyond that point in time and include 
them in its LGD estimates.  
 
 
 
534  
A certainty-equivalent cash flow is defined as the cash payment required for a risk averse investor to be 
indifferent between receiving the cash payment with certainty at the payment date and holding an asset 
which would yield an uncertain payout at the payment date. 
535  
A Reporting Bank may use an “effective interest rate” in accordance with FRS 109 as the discount rate, but 
in that case should adjust the stream of net recoveries in a way which is consistent with paragraph 1.4(c)(i) 
and (ii) of this Annex. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-363 
1.5 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.6(d) of Annex 7X, a Reporting Bank should 
identify and incorporate dependencies between default and recovery rates, so as to 
produce LGD estimates for its exposures which are consistent with downturn conditions 
identified according to paragraph 5.6(a) of Annex 7X. For example, the Reporting Bank 
may use some or all of the following techniques to identify adverse dependencies: 
 
(a)  a comparison of average recovery rates with recovery rates observed 
during appropriate downturn periods; 
 
(b)  a statistical analysis of the relationship between observed default and 
recovery rates over a complete economic cycle; 
 
(c)  for secured exposures where default is shown to be highly (negatively) 
correlated with collateral values, the Reporting Bank may compare – 
 
(i) 
the recovery rate forecasts derived from robust statistical models 
that use “typical” assumptions about collateral value changes with 
those under identified downturn conditions; or 
 
(ii)  observed recovery rates for defaulted exposures given typical 
collateral values with those under identified downturn conditions;  
 
(d)  an identification of the underlying factors (risk drivers) that determine 
recovery rates and analysis of the relationship between those factors and 
default rates, combined with an assessment of the net impact of those 
factors on recovery rates under downturn conditions. 
 
1.6 
For those exposures for which adverse dependencies between default and 
recovery rates have been identified through analysis consistent with paragraph 1.5 of this 
Annex, a Reporting Bank may derive LGD estimates by –  
 
(a) 
basing them on averages of observed loss rates during downturn periods 
identified according to paragraph 5.6(a) Annex 7X; or 
 
(b)  deriving them from forecasts based on stressing appropriate risk drivers 
in a manner consistent with downturn conditions identified according to 
paragraph 5.6(a) of Annex 7X. 
 
1.7 
For those exposures for which no material averse dependencies between default 
and recovery rates have been identified, a Reporting Bank may derive its LGD estimates 
by – 
 
(a)    basing them on long-run default-weighted averages of observed loss rates; 
or 
 
(b)  deriving them from forecasts that do not involve stressing appropriate risk 
drivers.

Section 2:  EAD Estimates for all Asset Classes 
 
2.1 
 
A Reporting Bank should ensure that its EAD estimates are based on reference 
data that reflect the obligor, facility and bank management practice characteristics of the 
exposures to which the estimates are applied as set out in paragraph 5.2(d) of Annex 7X.  
 
2.2 
 
For the purposes of meeting paragraph 2.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank 
should ensure that its EAD estimates applied to particular exposures are not based on data 
that comingle the effects of disparate characteristics or data from exposures that exhibit 
different characteristics (e.g. same broad product grouping but different obligors that are 
managed differently by the Reporting Bank). The EAD estimates should be based on 
appropriately homogenous pools.  
 
2.3  
 
Alternatively, a Reporting Bank should ensure that its EAD estimates are based 
on an estimation approach that effectively disentangles the impact of the different 
characteristics exhibited within the relevant dataset. For example, practices that generally 
do not comply with paragraph 2.1 of this Annex include use of estimates based or partly 
based on: 
 
(a)  data from SME or midmarket obligors being applied to large corporate 
obligor; 
 
(b)  data from commitments with small unused limit availability being applied 
to facilities with large unused limit availability;  
 
(c)  data from obligors already identified as problematic at reference date 
being applied to current obligors with no known issues (e.g. obligors at 
reference date who were already delinquent, watchlisted by a Reporting 
Bank, subject to recent limit reductions initiated by a Reporting Bank, 
blocked from further drawdowns or subject to other types of collections 
activity);   
 
(d)  data that has been affected by changes in obligors’ mix of borrowing and 
other credit-related products over the observation period unless that data 
has been effectively mitigated for such changes (e.g. by adjusting the data 
to remove the effects of the changes in the product mix). A Reporting 
Bank should, if required by the Authority, be able to demonstrate –  
 
(i)  
a detailed understanding of the impact of changes in product mix on 
EAD reference data sets (and associated EAD estimates); and  
 
(ii)  that the impact is immaterial or has been effectively mitigated within 
the Reporting Bank’s estimation process. Effective mitigation does 
not include –  
 
(A)  setting floors to CCF or EAD observations;  
 
(B)  use of obligor-level estimates that do not fully cover the 
relevant product transformation options or inappropriately 
combine products with very different characteristics (e.g. 
revolving loans and loans which are not revolving loans);  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-365 
(C)  adjusting only material observations affected by product 
transformation; and 
 
(D)  generally excluding observations affected by product profile 
transformation, 
thereby 
potentially 
distorting 
the 
representativeness of the remaining data. 
 
 
Section 3:  Use of the Undrawn Limit Factor (ULF) approach 
 
3.1 
In respect of the use of ULF approach as defined in paragraph 3.3 in this Annex 
to estimate CCFs, a Reporting Bank should ensure that their EAD estimates are effectively 
quarantined from the potential effects of the region of instability associated with facilities 
close to being fully drawn at reference date.  
 
3.2 
For the purposes of meeting paragraph 3.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank 
may, for example, –   
 
(a)  use an estimation method, other than the ULF approach, that avoids the 
instability issue by not using potentially small undrawn limits that could 
approach zero in the denominator or, as appropriate, switching to a 
method other than the ULF as the region of instability is approached (e.g. 
a limit factor, balance factor or additional utilisation factor approach as 
defined in paragraph 3.3 of this Annex);  
 
(b)  include limit utilisation as a driver in EAD models, which may quarantine 
much of the relevant portfolio from the instability issue. The Reporting 
Bank should consider other actions to develop appropriate EAD estimates 
to be applied to exposures within the region of instability; or  
 
(c)  not utilise approaches such as capping and flooring reference data (e.g. 
observed CCFs at one and zero respectively) or omitting observations that 
are judged to be affected.    
 
3.3 
For the purposes of this Section, the following definitions apply: 
 
(a) 
ULF approach refers to the derivation of a specific type of CCF, where 
predicted additional drawings in the lead-up to default are expressed as a 
percentage of the undrawn limit that remains available to the obligor 
under the terms and conditions of a facility (i.e. EAD = B0 = Bt + ULF [Lt 
- Bt], where B0 = facility balance at date of default; Bt = current balance 
(for predicted EAD) or balance at reference date; Lt = current limit (for 
predicted EAD) or limit at reference date (for realised or observed EAD);  
 
(b) 
A limit factor (LF) is a specific type of CCF where the predicted balance at 
default is expressed as a percentage of the total limit that is available to 
the obligor under the terms and conditions of a credit facility (i.e. EAD = 
B0 = LF[Lt], where B0 = facility balance at date of default; Bt = current 
balance (for predicted EAD) or balance at reference date (for observed 
EAD); Lt = current limit (for predicted EAD) or limit at reference date (for 
realised or observed EAD));  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-366 
  
(c) 
 A balance factor (BF) is a specific type of CCF where predicted balance at 
default is expressed as a percentage of the current balance that has been 
drawn down under a credit facility (i.e. EAD = B0 = BF[Bt]); 
 
(d) 
An additional utilisation factor (AUF) is a specific type of CCF, where 
predicted additional drawings in the lead-up to default are expressed as a 
percentage of the total limit that is available to the obligor under the terms 
and conditions of a credit facility (i.e. EAD = B0 = Bt +AUF[Lt]).

ILLUSTRATIVE RISK WEIGHTS CALCULATED UNDER THE IRBA 
 
 
1.1 
Table 7AA-1 provides illustrative risk weights calculated for 5 exposure types 
under the IRBA. Each set of risk weights was produced using the appropriate risk weight 
function in paragraphs 7.4.62 (Kcorp), 7.4.65 (Ksm), 7.4.82 (Kmort), 7.4.85 (Kqrre), and 
7.4.86 (Koret). The inputs used to calculate the illustrative risk weights include measures 
of PD, LGD, and an assumed effective maturity (M) of 2.5 years, where applicable. 
 
1.2 
In the case of exposures in the corporate small business asset sub-class, the 
risk weights set out in the third column of Table 7AA-1 incorporate the firm-size 
adjustment set out in paragraph 7.4.65.

ILLUSTRATION ON THE CALCULATION OF CREDIT RISK-WEIGHTED EXPOSURE 
AMOUNTS FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS 
 
 
Section 1:  Illustrative Example – Calculation using the LTA 
 
1.1 
Assume a Reporting Bank, which is using the SA(CR) for calculating capital 
requirements for credit risk and the SA-CCR for calculating pre-settlement counterparty 
exposures, owns 20% of the shares of an individual fund that replicates an equity index. 
Further assume that the fund holds forward contracts on listed equities that are cleared 
through a qualifying CCP of notional amount of $100, and presents the following balance 
sheet: 
 
Assets 
Cash 
 
 
 
 
 
$20 
Government bonds (AAA rated)  
 
 
$30 
Variation margin receivable – forward contracts536 
 
$50 
 
Liabilities 
Notes payable 
 
 
 
 
$5 
 
Equity 
Shares 
 
 
 
 
 
$95 
 
1.2 
The Reporting Bank must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
for an equity investment in a fund as follows:   
 
Credit RWELTA 
=  
min[Avg RWfund * Lvg, 1250%] * E 
 
=  
min[RWEfund / Total Assetsfund * Lvg, 1250%] * E 
 
where –  
 
(a)  RWEfund is calculated as the sum of –  
 
(i) 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for cash (i.e. $20), which 
will be risk-weighted according to the risk weight applied for cash 
(RW=0%), i.e. RWEcash = $20*0% = $0; 
 
(ii) 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for government bonds 
(i.e. $30), which will be risk-weighted according to the risk weight 
applied for government bonds (RW=0%), i.e. RWEbonds = $30*0% = 
$0; 
 
(iii) the credit risk-weighted exposure for the listed equities underlying 
the forward contract held by the fund based on the CCF applicable to 
forward contracts (i.e. 100%) multiplied by the notional amount (i.e 
$100) and risk weight associated with the underlying of the 
 
536  
That is, the collateral posted by the Reporting Bank to the qualifying CCP in respect of the forward contracts. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-370  
derivative exposures, which in this case is listed equity exposures 
(RW=250%), i.e. RWEunderlying = 100%*$100*250% = $250; and 
 
(iv) the counterparty credit risk associated with the pre-settlement 
counterparty exposures of the fund’s derivative transactions, in 
respect of the market value of the forward contracts and the 
collateral posted that is not held by the CCP on a bankruptcy remote 
basis, which will be risk-weighted according to the risk-weight 
applied for trade exposures to CCPs (i.e. 2%). Assuming that the 
application of SA-CCR results in a pre-settlement counterparty 
exposure of $56, the Reporting Bank must calculate the counterparty 
credit risk charge as RWECCR = $56*2% = $1.12. There is no CVA 
risk capital requirements assessed, since the forward contracts are 
cleared through a CCP;  
 
(b) 
Lvg = 
(Total Assets) / (Total Equity) 
= 
$100 / $95 
= 
1.05; 
 
(c)  E 
= 
Proportion of shares in fund * Total Equity 
= 
20% * $95 
= 
$19, assuming that this is the same amount as the carrying 
amount of the Reporting Bank’s equity investment in the fund 
as determined in accordance with paragraph 7.1.12(a).  
 
Therefore, Credit RWELTA = ($0 + $0 + $250 + $1.12) / $100 * 1.05 * $19 = $50.22 
 
 
Section 2:  Illustrative Example – Calculation using the MBA 
 
2.1 
Assume a Reporting Bank, which is using the SA(CR) for calculating capital 
requirements for credit risk and the SA-CCR for calculating pre-settlement counterparty 
exposures, owns 20% (i.e. representing an investment of $18.18) of the shares of an 
individual fund that replicates an equity index. Further assume that the fund has assets of 
$100, and a mandate that permits investments in cash, listed equities, and long positions 
in equity index futures up to a maximum nominal amount equivalent to the size of the 
fund’s balance sheet (that is, the total on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures 
of the fund can reach $200), and a maximum financial leverage of 1.1.  
 
2.2 
The Reporting Bank must calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
of its equity investment in the fund as follows:  
 
Credit RWEMBA  =  
min[Avg RWfund * Lvg, 1250%] * E 
 
=  
min[RWEfund / Total Assetsfund * Lvg, 1250%] * E 
 
where –  
 
(a) 
RWEfund is calculated as the sum of – 
 
(i) 
the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for on-balance sheet 
exposures of the fund (i.e. $100), which will be risk-weighted 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-371  
according to the risk weight applied for listed equity exposures 
(RW=250%), i.e. RWEon-balance = $100*250% = $250; 
 
(ii)  the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for the listed equities 
underlying the equity index futures based on the CCF applicable to 
forward purchases (i.e. 100%) multiplied by the maximum notional 
amount of the derivative exposures (i.e. $100) and risk weight 
associated with the underlying of the derivative exposures, which in 
this case is listed equity exposures (RW=250%), i.e. RWEunderlying = 
100%*$100*250% = $250; and 
 
(iii)  the counterparty credit risk associated with the pre-settlement 
counterparty exposures of the fund’s derivative transactions. 
Assuming that the Reporting Bank does not know the replacement 
cost related to the futures contract, the Reporting Bank must use the 
maximum notional amount (i.e. $100) as a proxy for the 
replacement cost. Assuming further that the Reporting Bank does 
not know the amount for potential future exposure related to the 
futures contract, the Reporting Bank must calculate the amount for 
potential future exposure as 15% of the maximum notional amount 
(i.e. 15%*$100). Assuming further that the futures contract is 
cleared through a qualifying CCP, such that a risk-weight of 2% will 
apply, and there is no CVA risk capital requirements assessed, since 
the futures contract is cleared through a CCP, the Reporting Bank 
must calculate the counterparty credit risk charge as RWECCR = 1.4 
* ($100 + 15%*$100) * 2% = $3.22; 
 
(b)  Lvg (as given) = 1.1; 
 
(c) 
Equity Investment (as given) = $18.18. 
 
Therefore, Credit RWEinvestment = ($250 + $250 +$3.22) / $100 * 1.1 * $18.18 = $100.63 
 
 
Section 3:  Illustrative Example – Calculation of the leverage adjustment 
 
3.1 
Assume a Reporting Bank, which is using the SA(CR) for calculating capital 
requirements for credit risk, has an equity investment in a fund with assets of $100 that 
invests in corporate debt. Further assume that the fund is highly levered with equity of $5 
and debt of $95 (i.e. the leverage of the fund = 100 / 5 = 20). Consider the following 2 
cases: 
 
Case 1  
 
Assets 
Cash 
 
 
$10 
A+ to A- bonds 
 
$20 
BBB+ to BBB- bonds  
$30 
BB+ to BB- bonds 
 
$40 
 
The average risk weight of the fund is 72.5% (i.e. ($10*0% + $20*50% + $30*75% + 
$40*100%) / $100). The financial leverage of 20 would result in a risk weight of 1450%. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-372  
The Reporting Bank must apply the conservative risk weight of 1250% for its equity 
investment in the fund, in accordance with paragraphs 7.5.5 and 7.5.13;   
 
Case 2 
 
Assets 
Cash 
 
 
$5 
AAA to AA- bonds 
 
$75 
A+ to A- bonds 
 
$20 
 
The average risk weight of the fund is 25% (i.e. ($5*0% + $75*20% + $20*50%) / $100). 
The financial leverage of 20 would result in a risk weight of 500%.   
 
3.2 
The above example illustrates that the rate at which the 1250% cap is reached 
is dependent on the underlying riskiness of the portfolio, which is determined by the 
average risk weight of the fund, as captured by the risk weights under the SA(CR) or the 
treatment under the IRBA. For example, the 1250% cap is reached fairly quickly for a 
portfolio with higher risk (e.g. 72.5% average risk weight) with a leverage of 17.2, while 
for a portfolio with lower risk (e.g. 25% average risk weight), the 1250% cap is reached 
at a leverage of 50.

Annex 7AC 
 
REQUIREMENTS FOR EXCLUSION OF SECURITISED EXPOSURES FROM THE 
CALCULATION OF CREDIT RWA  
 
 
Section 1:  Traditional Securitisation  
 
1.1 
In the case of a traditional securitisation, a Reporting Bank may exclude 
securitised exposures from its calculation of credit RWA only if all of the following 
requirements have been complied with:   
 
(a) 
except as provided for in sub-paragraph (h)(i), significant credit risk 
associated with the underlying exposures has been transferred to external 
parties. For the purposes of the assessment of whether significant credit 
risk has been transferred, the Reporting Bank must treat material costs of 
credit protection purchased that have not yet been recognised in earnings 
as a retained position of the Reporting Bank537; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank does not have any effective control over the underlying 
exposures. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph, a Reporting Bank is 
deemed to have effective control over the transferred underlying 
exposures if – 
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank is able to repurchase from the transferee the 
previously transferred underlying exposures in order to realise the 
benefits of those exposures; or 
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank is obligated to retain the risk of the transferred 
underlying exposures.   
 
To avoid doubt, where a Reporting Bank acts as a servicer in respect of 
the transferred underlying exposures, this does not necessarily mean that 
the Reporting Bank has effective control of the exposures; 
 
 
537  
In determining whether the costs of credit protection are material, a Reporting Bank should consider factors 
such as –  
(a)  a comparison of the present value of the premiums and other costs not yet recognised in profit and 
loss relative to expected losses of the protected exposures over a variety of stress scenarios; and 
(b)  the pricing of the credit protection relative to market prices. 
 
The Reporting Bank should consider costs of credit protection to be material when –  
(a) the cost of credit protection over the life of the protection contract equals, or exceeds, the amount of 
the exposures for which the protection is being purchased; or 
(b) the credit protection has rebate mechanisms, where the protection provider agrees to refund parts of 
the cost of credit protection to the Reporting Bank according to the performance of the protected 
exposure, as such mechanisms are indications of excessive premium.  
For the purposes of the analysis of whether the costs of credit protection are material, the Reporting Bank 
should quantify the costs of credit protection that have yet to be recognised in profit and loss through an 
appropriately conservative present value calculation. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-374  
(c) 
the Reporting Bank obtains a written independent legal opinion 538 
confirming that the underlying exposures are legally isolated from the 
Reporting Bank such that they are beyond the reach of the Reporting Bank 
and its creditors, even in an insolvency situation or receivership; 
 
(d) 
the securities issued pursuant to the securitisation are not obligations of 
the Reporting Bank and any investor who purchases the securities only 
has a claim to the underlying exposures; 
 
(e) 
the securities are issued pursuant to the securitisation by an SPE and the 
holders of the securities have the right to pledge, transfer or sell their 
interests without restriction, unless such restriction is imposed by a risk 
retention requirement under the legislation governing the securitisation;  
 
(f) 
where a securitisation includes a clean up call, the call complies with the 
requirements set out in Section 3 of this Annex; 
 
(g) 
where a securitisation includes early amortisation provisions, the 
provisions do not result in the securitisation transaction contravening the 
requirements set out in Section 4 of this Annex;  
 
(h) 
the documentation of the securitisation does not contain any clauses 
that – 
 
(i) 
other than clean-up calls, obliges the Reporting Bank to repurchase 
any of the underlying exposures, at any time, except where that 
obligation arises from the exercise of a representation or warranty 
given by the Reporting Bank. The Reporting Bank may give a 
representation or warranty solely in respect of the nature or existing 
state of facts of any underlying exposure that is capable of being 
verified at the time of its transfer, subject to the Reporting Bank 
undertaking due diligence prior to giving any such representation or 
warranty ;  
 
 
(ii) 
requires the Reporting Bank to alter the underlying exposures such 
that the credit quality of the pool is improved unless this is achieved 
by selling exposures to independent external parties which are not 
related corporations or affiliates of the Reporting Bank, at market 
prices. To avoid doubt, this requirement does not preclude the 
substitution of non-defaulted assets which have been fully amortised ; 
 
(iii) allows for increases in a retained first loss position or credit 
enhancement provided by the Reporting Bank after the inception of 
the securitisation;   
 
 
538  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal counsel, a Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel is independent of the parties involved in the origination and transfer of assets underlying  the 
securitisation transaction. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-375  
(iv) increases the yield payable to parties other than the Reporting 
Bank539, in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the 
underlying exposures; or 
 
(v) 
allow for termination options or triggers for termination, except for 
eligible clean-up calls or termination triggered by specific changes in 
tax or regulations; 
 
(i) 
the transfer of the underlying exposures or the transfer of risk through 
sub-participation does not contravene the terms and conditions of any 
underlying agreement in respect of the underlying exposures and where 
applicable, all the necessary consents for the transfer or sub-participation 
have been obtained;  
 
(j) 
the documentation of the securitisation specifies that, if cash flows relating 
to the underlying exposures are rescheduled or renegotiated, the SPE and 
not the Reporting Bank, would be subject to the rescheduled or 
renegotiated terms;  
 
(k) 
the Reporting Bank receives a fixed amount of consideration for the 
underlying exposures. To avoid doubt, the amount of consideration 
received in the form of a fixed amount of securities in the SPE would be 
regarded as meeting this requirement if the transaction is conducted at 
arm’s length and on market terms and conditions. Also, this requirement 
does not preclude excess cash from being channeled to the Reporting Bank 
after all claims connected with the securities issued by the SPE have been 
paid out;   
 
(l) 
all transactions with the SPE are conducted at arm’s length and on market 
terms and conditions, subject to paragraph 1.2 of this Annex;  
 
(m) the RWA of the Reporting Bank’s exposures to the securitisation is at all 
times not more than 20% of the sum of the RWA of all the securitisation 
exposures of the securitisation. 
 
1.2 
The requirement in paragraph 1.1(l) of this Annex does not apply where a 
Reporting Bank acquires securities in an SPE pursuant to an underwriting arrangement, 
provided that the Reporting Bank complies with paragraph 1.1(m) of this Annex no later 
than 8 weeks after the date on which the securities were acquired.  
 
1.3 
Despite paragraph 1.1(m) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank that holds more than 
20% of the sum of the RWA of all securitisation exposures of a securitisation must seek 
the Authority’s prior written approval if it intends to exclude the securitised exposures 
from its calculation of credit RWA. The Authority will not grant such approval unless the 
Reporting Bank is able to demonstrate to the Authority’s satisfaction that a significant 
portion of the credit risk associated with the underlying exposures has been transferred to 
external parties, and the requirements in paragraph 1.1(a) to (l) of this Annex have been 
complied with. 
 
 
 
539  
For example, investors or external providers of credit enhancements.

Section 2:  Synthetic Securitisation  
 
2.1 
In the case of a synthetic securitisation, a Reporting Bank may recognise the 
credit protection obtained through the synthetic securitisation in its calculation of credit 
RWA only if all of the following requirements have been complied with: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank transfers significant credit risk associated with the 
underlying exposures to external parties. For the purposes of the 
assessment of whether significant credit risk has been transferred, the 
Reporting Bank must treat material costs of credit protection purchased 
that have not yet been recognised in earnings as a retained position of the 
Reporting Bank540; 
 
(b)  the instrument used to transfer credit risk does not contain terms or 
conditions that limit the amount of credit risk transferred, including 
clauses that –  
 
(i) 
materially limit the credit protection or credit risk transference541; 
 
(ii) 
require the Reporting Bank to alter the underlying exposures to 
improve the average credit quality of the pool. To avoid doubt, this 
requirement does not preclude the substitution of non-defaulted 
assets which have been fully amortised;  
 
(iii) increase the cost of credit protection to the Reporting Bank in 
response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying 
exposures;  
 
(iv) increase the yield payable to parties other than the Reporting Bank542, 
in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying 
exposures; or 
 
(v) 
allow for increases in a retained first loss position or credit 
enhancement provided by the Reporting Bank after the inception of 
the securitisation;  
 
540  
In determining whether the costs of credit protection are material, a Reporting Bank should consider factors 
such as –  
(a)  a comparison of the present value of the premiums and other costs not yet recognised in profit and 
loss relative to expected losses of the protected exposures over a variety of stress scenarios; and 
(b)  the pricing of the credit protection relative to market prices. 
 
The Reporting Bank should consider costs of credit protection to be material when –  
(a)  the cost of credit protection over the life of the protection contract equals, or exceeds, the amount of 
the exposures for which the protection is being purchased; or 
(b)  the credit protection has rebate mechanisms, where the protection provider agrees to refund parts of 
the cost of credit protection to the Reporting Bank according to the performance of the protected 
exposure, as such mechanisms are indications of excessive premium.  
For the purposes of the analysis of whether the costs of credit protection are material, the Reporting Bank 
should quantify the costs of credit protection that have yet to be recognised in profit and loss through an 
appropriately conservative present value calculation. 
541  
For instance, by way of an early amortisation provision in a securitisation of revolving loans that effectively 
subordinates the Reporting Bank’s interest, significant materiality thresholds below which credit protection 
is deemed not to be triggered even if a credit event occurs, or clauses that allow for the termination of the 
credit protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures.  
542  
For example, investors or external providers of credit enhancements. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-377  
 
(c)  the Reporting Bank obtains a written independent legal opinion543 that 
confirms the enforceability of the contracts in all relevant countries or 
jurisdictions; 
 
(d)  where a securitisation includes a clean up call, the call complies with the 
requirements set out in Section 3 of this Annex; 
 
(e)  when a securitisation includes early amortisation provisions, the 
provisions do not result in the securitisation transaction contravening the 
requirements set out in Section 4 of this Annex;   
 
(f)  in the case where the risks associated with the underlying exposures are 
transferred to an SPE –    
 
(i) 
the securities issued by the SPE are not obligations of the Reporting 
Bank;  
 
(ii) 
the holders of the interests in that SPE have the right to pledge or 
exchange their interests without restriction; and 
 
(iii) all transactions with the SPE are conducted at arm’s length and on 
market terms and conditions, subject to paragraph 2.2 of this Annex;  
 
(g) 
the RWA of the Reporting Bank’s exposures to the securitisation is at all 
times not more than 20% of the sum of the RWA of all the securitisation 
exposures of the securitisation. 
 
2.2 
The requirement in paragraph 2.1(f)(iii) of this Annex does not apply where a 
Reporting Bank acquires securities in an SPE pursuant to an underwriting arrangement, 
provided that the Reporting Bank complies with paragraph 2.1(g) of this Annex no later 
than 8 weeks after the date on which the securities were acquired.  
 
2.3 
Despite paragraph 2.1(g) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank that holds more than 
20% of the sum of the RWA of all the securitisation exposures of the securitisation must 
seek the Authority’s prior written approval if it intends to recognise the credit protection 
obtained through a synthetic securitisation in its calculation of credit RWA. The Authority 
will not grant such approval unless the Reporting Bank is able to demonstrate to the 
Authority’s satisfaction that a significant portion of the credit risk associated with the 
underlying exposures has been transferred to external parties, and the requirements in 
paragraph 2.1(a) to (f) of this Annex have been complied with. 
 
 
Section 3:  Securitisation Containing Clean-Up Calls 
 
3.1 
If a securitisation includes a clean-up call, the Reporting Bank which has the 
ability to exercise the clean-up call must ensure that –  
 
543  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal counsel, the Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel should be independent of the parties executing the synthetic securitisation transaction. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-378  
  
(a) 
the exercise of the clean-up call is at its discretion and is not mandatory, 
in form or in substance;  
  
(b) 
the clean-up call is not structured to avoid allocating losses to credit 
enhancements or positions held by investors or in any way structured to 
provide credit enhancement; and  
 
(c) 
the clean-up call is exercisable by the Reporting Bank only when 10% or 
less of the original underlying exposures or securities issued remain or, 
for synthetic securitisation, when 10% or less of the original reference 
portfolio value remains. 
 
3.2 
Where a clean-up call, when exercised, is found to serve as a credit 
enhancement, the Reporting Bank must consider the exercise of the clean-up call as a 
form of implicit support and treat it in accordance with paragraph 7.6.105. 
 
3.3 
Where a securitisation includes a clean-up call which does not meet all of the 
criteria in paragraph 3.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank which is an originator of the 
securitisation must –  
 
(a) 
in the case of a traditional securitisation, treat the underlying exposures 
as if they were not securitised. Additionally, the Reporting Bank must 
deduct from Common Equity Tier 1 capital any increase in equity capital 
due to a gain-on-sale in accordance with paragraph 6.1.5(f); and 
 
(b) 
in the case of a synthetic securitisation, hold capital against the entire 
amount of the securitised exposure as if the Reporting Bank did not benefit 
from any credit protection.  
 
3.4 
Where a synthetic securitisation incorporates a call (other than a clean-up call) 
that effectively terminates the transaction and the purchased credit protection on a specific 
date, a Reporting Bank which is an originator of the synthetic securitisation must treat the 
transaction in accordance with paragraph 7.6.107. 
  
 
Section 4:  Securitisation Containing Early Amortisation Provisions 
 
4.1 
A Reporting Bank is deemed not to have met the requirements for exclusion of 
securitised exposures, or recognition of the credit protection obtained through the 
synthetic securitisation, set out in Section 1 and Section 2 of this Annex, and must not 
exclude securitised exposures, or recognise the credit protection obtained through the 
synthetic securitisation, in the calculation of credit RWA if – 
 
(a) 
the securitisation originated by the Reporting Bank is a securitisation of 
one or more revolving loans in the underlying pool; and  
 
(b) 
the securitisation transaction incorporates an early amortisation provision 
or similar provision that, if triggered, would – 
 
(i) 
subordinate the Reporting Bank’s senior or pari passu interest in the 
underlying revolving loans to the interest of other investors; 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-379  
 
(ii) 
subordinate the Reporting Bank’s subordinated interest to an even 
greater degree relative to the interests of other parties; or 
 
(iii) 
in other ways increase the Reporting Bank’s exposure to losses 
associated with the underlying revolving loans. 
 
4.2 
Despite paragraph 4.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank may exclude securitised 
exposures from, or recognise the credit protection obtained through the synthetic 
securitisation in, the calculation of credit RWA if the securitisation transaction meets the 
operational requirements in Section 1 (for a traditional securitisation) and Section 2 (for a 
synthetic securitisation) of this Annex, and contains one of the following early amortisation 
provisions:    
 
(a) 
replenishment structures where the underlying exposures do not revolve 
and the early amortisation terminates the ability of the Reporting Bank to 
add new exposures; 
 
(b) 
transactions of revolving loans containing early amortisation features that 
mimic term structures (i.e. where the risk on the underlying facilities does 
not return to the Reporting Bank) and where the early amortisation 
provisions do not effectively result in subordination of the Reporting 
Bank’s interest; 
 
(c) 
structures where the Reporting Bank securitises one or more revolving 
loans and where investors remain fully exposed to future draws by 
borrowers even after an early amortisation event has occurred;  
 
(d) 
the early amortisation clause is triggered solely by events544 not related 
to the performance of the securitised assets or the Reporting Bank. 
 
 
 
544  
For example, material changes in tax laws or regulations.

Annex 7AD 
 
 
OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF SEC-ERBA 
 
 
Section 1:  Operational Requirements for Use of External Credit Assessments 
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the following operational criteria are satisfied 
before it uses an external credit assessment to determine risk weights for a securitisation 
exposure:  
 
(a)  the external credit assessment must take into account and reflect the 
entire amount of credit risk exposure a Reporting Bank has with regard to 
all payments owed to it545; 
 
(b)  the external credit assessment must be from a recognised ECAI listed in 
Annex 7N; 
 
(c)  the external credit assessment, procedures, methodologies, assumptions 
and the key elements underlying the external credit assessment must be 
publicly available in an accessible form on a non-selective basis and free 
of charge546, and the external credit assessment must be included in the 
ECAI’s transition matrix;  
 
(d)  the ECAI’s loss and cash flow analysis of the securitisation transaction and 
the sensitivity of external credit assessments to changes in the underlying 
credit assessment assumptions must be publicly available;  
 
(e)  the external credit assessment must not be made available only to the 
parties to a transaction;  
 
(f) 
 recognised ECAIs must have a demonstrated expertise in assessing 
securitisations, which may be evidenced by common and widespread 
reliance by independent investors on the ECAI’s external credit 
assessments; 
 
 
(g)  where 2 or more recognised ECAIs assess the credit risk of the same 
securitisation exposure differently, the Reporting Bank must apply 
paragraph 7.3.30; 
 
(h) 
where CRM is provided to specific underlying exposures or the entire pool 
by an eligible protection provider, and is reflected in the external credit 
assessment assigned to a securitisation exposure, the Reporting Bank 
must apply the risk weight associated with that external credit assessment. 
 
545 
For example, if the Reporting Bank is owed both principal and interest, the assessment must fully take into 
account and reflect the credit risk associated with timely repayment of both principal and interest. 
546  
Where the eligible credit assessment is not publicly available free of charge, a Reporting Bank should ensure 
that the ECAI provides an adequate justification within its own publicly available code of conduct, in 
accordance with the “comply or explain” nature of the IOSCO’s Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit 
Rating Agencies. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-381  
In order to avoid any double-counting, the Reporting Bank must not 
recognise additional CRM in this case; 
 
(i) 
where CRM is provided to specific underlying exposures or the entire pool 
by a protection provider which is not an eligible protection provider, and 
the effect of the CRM is reflected in the external credit assessment 
assigned to a securitisation exposure, the Reporting Bank must treat the 
securitisation exposure as unrated; 
 
(j) 
 where a CRM solely protects a specific securitisation exposure within a 
given structure and this protection is reflected in the external credit 
assessment of that securitisation exposure, the Reporting Bank must treat 
the exposure as if it is unrated and then recognise the effect of the CRM 
based on the CRM treatment for SA(CR) or F-IRBA exposures to recognise 
the CRM;  
 
(k) 
where the external credit assessment of a securitisation exposure is at 
least partly based on unfunded support provided by the Reporting Bank, 
the Reporting Bank must treat the securitisation exposure as unrated547.   
 
 
Section 2:  Operational Requirements for Use of Inferred Credit Assessments 
 
2.1 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the following operational criteria are satisfied 
before it uses an inferred credit assessment to determine risk weights for an unrated 
securitisation exposure in the SEC-ERBA:  
 
(a) 
the reference securitisation exposure from which the inferred credit 
assessment is derived must rank pari passu or be subordinate in all 
respects to the unrated securitisation exposure. Credit enhancements, if 
any, must be taken into account when assessing the relative subordination 
of the unrated securitisation exposure and the reference securitisation 
exposure548; 
 
(b) 
the maturity of the reference securitisation exposure must be equal to or 
longer than that of the unrated securitisation exposure; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must update any inferred credit assessment on an 
ongoing basis to reflect any subordination of the unrated securitisation 
exposure or changes in the external credit assessment of the reference 
securitisation exposure;  
 
 
547  
For example, if a Reporting Bank buys ABCP where it provides an unfunded securitisation exposure 
extended to the ABCP programme (e.g. liquidity facility or credit enhancement), and that exposure plays a 
role in determining the external credit assessment of the ABCP, the Reporting Bank must treat the ABCP 
as if it were an unrated exposure. 
548  
For example, if the reference securitisation exposure benefits from any external party guarantees or other 
credit enhancements that are not available to the unrated securitisation exposure, the Reporting Bank must 
not assign an inferred credit assessment to the unrated securitisation exposure based on the reference 
securitisation exposure. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-382  
(d) 
the external credit assessment of the reference securitisation exposure 
must satisfy the operational requirements for use of external credit 
assessments in Section 1 of this Annex.

FOR 
SIMPLE, 
TRANSPARENT 
AND 
COMPARABLE 
(STC) 
SECURITISATIONS THAT ARE NOT ABCP PROGRAMMES (STC CRITERIA) 
  
 
Section 1:  Asset Risk 
 
 
 Nature of Assets 
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the assets underlying the securitisation are 
credit claims or receivables that are homogeneous. In assessing homogeneity, the 
Reporting Bank must give consideration to asset type, country or jurisdiction, legal system 
and currency, in accordance with paragraph 1.3 of this Annex.  
 
1.2 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that credit claims or receivables for the more 
exotic asset classes have contractually identified periodic payment streams relating to 
rental549, principal, interest, or principal and interest payments as such asset classes 
require deeper and more complex analysis. The Reporting Bank must ensure that any 
referenced interest payments or discount rates are based on commonly encountered 
market interest rates550, but do not reference complex or complicated formulae or exotic 
derivatives. For the purposes of this paragraph, an “exotic instrument” is defined as a 
financial asset or instrument with features making it more complex than plain vanilla 
products551. 
 
1.3 
A Reporting Bank may only assess the credit claims or receivables underlying a 
securitisation to be homogeneous where all of the following criteria are satisfied:   
 
(a)  The nature of assets are such that investors would not need to analyse 
and assess materially different legal or credit risk factors, or both, and risk 
profiles when carrying out risk analysis and due diligence checks; 
 
(b)  the assets underlying the securitisation have common risk drivers, 
including similar risk factors and risk profiles;  
 
(c)  credit claims or receivables included in the securitisation have obligations 
that are consistent with market practices, in terms of rights to payments 
or income, or both, from assets and that result in a periodic and well-
defined stream of payments to investors. The Reporting Bank must deem  
 
549  
Payments on operating and financing leases are considered to be rental payments rather than payments 
of principal and interest.   
550  
Commonly encountered market interest rates may include rates reflective of a lender’s cost of funds, to 
the extent that sufficient data are provided to investors to allow them to assess their relation to other 
market rates. Examples of these include – 
(a)  interbank rates and rates set by monetary policy authorities, such as Libor, Euribor and the federal 
funds rate; and 
(b)  sectoral rates reflective of a lender’s cost of funds, such as internal interest rates that directly reflect 
the market costs of a bank’s funding or that of a subset of institutions. 
551  
As defined by the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP). Interest rate caps or floors would not be 
automatically considered exotic derivatives.   


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-384  
credit card facilities to result in a periodic and well-defined stream of 
payments to investors for the purposes of this criterion;  
 
(d)  repayment of noteholders rely on the principal and interest proceeds from 
the securitised assets;  
 
(e)  despite sub-paragraph (d), partial reliance on refinancing or re-sale of the 
asset securing the exposure may occur provided that re-financing is 
sufficiently distributed within the pool, and the residual values on which 
the repayment relies through re-financing or re-sale of assets are 
sufficiently low.  
 
 
Asset Performance History 
 
1.4 
In order to provide investors with sufficient information on an asset class to 
conduct appropriate due diligence and access to a sufficiently rich data set to enable a 
more accurate calculation of expected loss in different stress scenarios, a Reporting Bank 
must ensure that verifiable loss performance data, including delinquency and default data, 
is available to investors for credit claims and receivables with substantially similar risk 
characteristics to those being securitised, for a time period long enough to permit 
meaningful evaluation of risk by investors552. The Reporting Bank must ensure that sources 
of and access to data and the basis for claiming similarity to credit claims or receivables 
being securitised are clearly disclosed to all market participants.  
 
1.5 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the originator of the securitisation, as 
well as the original lender who underwrites the assets, has sufficient experience in 
originating exposures similar to those securitised.  
 
1.6 
A Reporting Bank that is an investor in a securitisation must satisfy itself that 
the performance history of the originator and the original lender for substantially similar 
claims or receivables to those being securitised has been established for a time period that 
is –  
 
(a)  long enough to permit meaningful evaluation of risk553; and 
   
(b)  no shorter than a period of 5 years for retail exposures and purchased 
retail receivables, and no shorter than a period of 7 years for exposures 
that are not retail exposures554.  
 
 
 
552  
The time period used by the Reporting Bank should ideally cover a complete economic cycle.  
553  
The time period used by the Reporting Bank should ideally cover a complete economic cycle. 
554  
As an additional consideration, a Reporting Bank that is an investor in a securitisation should consider 
whether the servicer and other parties with a fiduciary responsibility to the securitisation have an 
established performance history in relation to substantially similar credit claims or receivables to those 
being securitised and for an appropriately long period of time. This additional consideration may form part 
of the Reporting Bank’s due diligence process, but does not form part of the determination of whether the 
securitisation meets all the STC Criteria. It is not the intention of this consideration to form an impediment 
to the entry of new participants to the market, but rather that a Reporting Bank should also take into 
account the performance history of the transaction parties when deciding whether to invest in a 
securitisation. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-385  
Payment Status 
 
1.7 
Non-performing credit claims and receivables are likely to require more complex 
and heightened analysis. In order to ensure that only performing credit claims and 
receivables are assigned to a securitisation, a Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that credit 
claims or receivables being transferred to a securitisation do not include, at the time of 
inclusion in the pool, obligations that are in default or delinquent, or obligations for which 
the transferor 555 or parties to the securitisation 556 are aware of evidence indicating a 
material increase in expected losses or enforcement actions.   
 
1.8 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the originator does not transfer any 
credit claims or receivables to the securitisation unless the credit claims or receivables 
meet all of the following conditions:   
 
(a) 
the obligor of the credit claim or receivable has not been the subject of an 
insolvency or debt restructuring proceedings due to financial difficulties 
within 3 years prior to the date of origination, unless the obligor’s credit 
incidents have been removed from credit registries and the obligor belongs 
to a country or jurisdiction in which borrowers have the legal right to 
remove negative credit records after the passage of a period of time or 
after certain conditions have been met; 
 
(b) 
the obligor of the credit claim or receivable is not recorded on a public 
credit registry of persons with an adverse credit history; 
 
(c) 
the obligor of the credit claim or receivable does not have a credit 
assessment by an ECAI or a credit score indicating a significant risk of 
default;  
 
(d) 
the credit claim or receivable is not subject to a dispute between the 
obligor and the original lender. 
 
1.9 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the originator assesses the credit 
claims or receivables in accordance with paragraph 1.8 of this Annex no earlier than 45 
days prior to the closing date. In addition, at the time of this assessment, the Reporting 
Bank must satisfy itself that the originator has assessed that there is no evidence indicating 
likely deterioration in the performance status of the credit claim or receivable. 
 
1.10 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that, at the time of the inclusion of the 
credit claims or receivables in the pool, at least one payment must have been made on 
each underlying exposure, except in the case of revolving asset trust structures (including 
those for credit card receivables and trade receivables) and other exposures payable in a 
single instalment at maturity. 
 
 
Consistency of Underwriting 
 
1.11 
To ensure that the quality of the securitised credit claims and receivables is not 
affected by changes in underwriting standards, a Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that 
 
555  
For example, the originator. 
556  
For example, the servicer or a party with a fiduciary responsibility. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-386  
the originator demonstrates to investors that any credit claims or receivables being 
transferred to the securitisation have been originated in the ordinary course of the 
originator’s business and are subject to sound and prudent underwriting standards that 
are materially non-deteriorating.557 Where underwriting standards change, the Reporting 
Bank must satisfy itself that the originator will disclose the timing and purpose of such 
changes before the change. The Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the originator does 
not impose less stringent standards than those applied to credit claims and receivables 
retained on the originator’s balance sheet. 
 
1.12 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the credit claims or receivables 
transferred to the securitisation are credit claims or receivables which have satisfied 
materially non-deteriorating underwriting standards and are credit claims or receivables – 
 
(a)  for which the obligors have been assessed by the originator as having the 
ability and willingness to make timely payments on obligations; or  
 
(b)  on granular pools of obligors originated in the ordinary course of the 
originator’s business where expected cash flows have been modelled to 
meet stated obligations of the securitisation under prudently stressed loan 
loss scenarios.  
 
1.13 
Where the originator is not the original lender who underwrote the credit claims 
or receivables being transferred to the securitisation, a Reporting Bank must satisfy itself 
that the originator –  
 
(a) 
has verified that the original lender underwrote the credit claims or 
receivables based on sound and prudent underwriting standards; 
  
(b) 
has ensured that the original lender has underwriting standards and 
assessed the quality of such underwriting standards; and 
 
(c) 
has ascertained that the original lender has assessed the obligors of the 
credit claims and receivables as having the ability and willingness to make 
timely payments on their obligations. 
 
 
Asset Selection and Transfer 
 
1.14 
Whilst recognising that credit claims or receivables transferred to a 
securitisation will be subject to defined eligibility criteria set out in the securitisation 
documentation 558, a Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the performance of the 
securitisation does not rely upon the ongoing selection of assets through active 
management on a discretionary basis of the securitisation’s underlying portfolio. The 
Reporting Bank need not deem – 
 
(a) 
the addition of credit claims or receivables to the securitisation’s 
underlying portfolio during the revolving periods; or 
 
557  
Investor analysis should be simpler and more straightforward where the securitisation is of credit claims or 
receivables that satisfy materially non-deteriorating origination standards. 
558  
Such as the size of the obligation, the age of the borrower or the LTV (loan-to-value) of the property, DTI 
(debt-to-income) or DSC (debt service coverage) ratios.

(b) 
the substitution or repurchasing of credit claims or receivables from the 
securitisation’s underlying portfolio due to a breach of representations or 
warranties by the originator,  
 
to be active management, if the credit claims or receivables referred to in sub-paragraphs 
(a) and (b) are not added or substituted on a discretionary basis. 
 
1.15 
For the purposes of paragraph 1.14 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
ensure that credit claims or receivables transferred to a securitisation 
satisfy clearly-defined eligibility criteria set out in the securitisation 
documentation;  
 
(b) 
satisfy itself that credit claims or receivables transferred to a securitisation 
after the closing date will not be actively selected or actively managed; 
and  
 
(c) 
ensure that sufficient information on the securitisation is made available 
to allow investors to assess the credit risk of the asset pool prior to their 
investment decisions. 
 
1.16 
In order to meet the principle of true sale, a Reporting Bank must ensure, and 
obtain a written independent legal opinion559 confirming, that under the applicable laws 
governing the securitisation transaction, the securitisation effects a true sale such that the 
underlying credit claims or receivables – 
  
(a) 
are legally enforceable against the respective obligors and such legal 
enforceability is included in the representations and warranties of the 
securitisation; 
 
(b) 
are beyond the reach of the seller, its creditors or liquidators and are not 
subject to material re-characterisation or clawback risks; 
 
(c) 
subject to paragraph 1.17 of this Annex, are not effected through credit 
default swaps, derivatives or guarantees, but by a transfer of the credit 
claims or the receivables to the securitisation; and 
 
(d) 
demonstrate effective recourse to the ultimate obligation for the 
underlying credit claims or receivables and are not a securitisation of other 
securitisations.  
 
1.17 
The requirement in paragraph 1.16(c) of this Annex does not apply to a 
Reporting Bank where the securitisation is in a country or jurisdiction whose legal 
framework provides a means, other than by way of a transfer of the credit claims or 
receivables, to effect true sale in relation to the securitisation, provided that the Reporting 
Bank satisfies itself that the underlying credit claims or receivables meet the requirements 
 
559  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal opinion, a Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel providing the legal opinion should be independent of the parties involved in the origination 
and transfer of assets underlying the securitisation transaction. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-388  
in paragraph 1.16(a), (b) and (d) of this Annex. The Reporting Bank must satisfy itself 
that for a securitisation in relation to which a true sale is effected by means other than a 
transfer of the credit claims or receivables, the originator – 
 
(a)  clearly demonstrates the existence of material obstacles preventing the 
transfer of credit claims or receivables at the issuance of the 
securitisation560 and the method of recourse to ultimate obligors561; and 
 
(b) 
clearly discloses to investors any conditions where the transfer of the 
credit claims or receivables is delayed or contingent upon specific events, 
and any factors affecting timely perfection of claims by the securitisation. 
 
1.18 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the originator has provided representations 
and warranties that the credit claims or receivables being transferred to the securitisation 
are not subject to any condition or encumbrance that can be foreseen to adversely affect 
the legal enforceability in respect of collections due from the respective obligors. 
 
 
 
Initial and Ongoing Data 
 
1.19 
To assist investors in conducting appropriate due diligence prior to investing in 
a new offering, a Reporting Bank must ensure that sufficient data at the level of each 
credit claim or receivable subject to compliance with applicable laws governing the 
provision of such information, or in the case of granular pools, summary stratification data 
on the relevant risk characteristics of the underlying pool, is available to potential investors 
before pricing of a securitisation. 
 
1.20 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that timely data at the level of each credit 
claim or receivable subject to compliance with applicable laws governing the provisions of 
such information or granular pool stratification data on the risk characteristics of the 
underlying pool and standardised investor reports is and will be made readily available to 
current and potential investors at least on a quarterly basis throughout the life of the 
securitisation, to assist investors in conducting appropriate and ongoing monitoring of their 
investments’ performance and to enable investors that wish to purchase a securitisation 
in the secondary market to have sufficient information to conduct appropriate due diligence. 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that cut-off dates of the loan-level or granular pool 
stratification data are aligned with those used for investor reporting. 
 
1.21 
To provide a level of assurance that the reporting of the underlying credit claims 
or receivables is accurate and that the underlying credit claims or receivables meet the 
eligibility requirements, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the initial portfolio is reviewed 
for conformity with the eligibility criteria by an appropriate legally accountable and 
independent external party562. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the review of the 
initial portfolio confirms that the credit claims or receivables transferred to the 
securitisation meet the eligibility criteria set out in the securitisation documentation, and 
the Reporting Bank may allow the review to be undertaken on a representative sample of 
the initial portfolio with the application of a minimum confidence level. The Reporting Bank 
 
560  
Such as the immediate realisation of transfer tax or the requirement to notify all obligors of the transfer.  
561  
Such as equitable assignment or perfected contingent transfer. 
562  
For example, an independent accounting practice, the calculation agent or management company for the 
securitisation. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-389  
must ensure that the initial offering documentation of the securitisation contains a 
disclosure of the results of the review, including any material exceptions.  
 
 
Section 2:  Structural Risk 
 
 
Redemption Cash Flows 
 
2.1 
Liabilities subject to the refinancing risk of the underlying credit claims or 
receivables are likely to require more complex and heightened analysis. To ensure that 
the underlying credit claims or receivables do not need to be refinanced over a short period 
of time, a Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the securitisation does not rely on the 
sale or refinancing of the underlying credit claims or receivables in order to repay the 
liabilities, unless the underlying pool of credit claims or receivables is sufficiently granular 
and has sufficiently distributed repayment profiles. The Reporting Bank must consider 
rights to receive income from the assets specified to support redemption payments as 
eligible credit claims or receivables in this regard563. 
 
 
Currency and Interest Rate Asset and Liability Mismatches 
 
2.2 
To reduce the payment risk arising from the different interest rate and currency 
profiles of assets and liabilities and to improve investors’ ability to model cash flows, a 
Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the interest rate and foreign currency risks of the 
securitisation are appropriately mitigated at all times, and if any hedging transaction is 
executed, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the transaction is documented according 
to industry-standard master agreements. To avoid doubt, the term “appropriately 
mitigated” does not require a perfect hedge. Subject to paragraph 2.4 of this Annex, the 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the securitisation only conducts these hedging 
transactions with derivatives used for hedging of asset and liability mismatches of interest 
rate, currency, or both.  
 
2.3 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the originator will demonstrate the 
appropriateness of the mitigation of interest rate and foreign currency through the life of 
the transaction by making available to potential investors, in a timely and regular manner, 
quantitative information including the fraction of notional amounts that are hedged, as 
well as sensitivity analysis that illustrates the effectiveness of the hedge under extreme 
but plausible scenarios.  
 
2.4 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that if the securitisation does not perform 
hedges through derivatives, then the securitisation must only use risk-mitigating 
measures that are specifically created and used for the purposes of hedging an individual 
and specific risk, and not multiple risks at the same time564. The Reporting Bank must 
satisfy itself that non-derivative risk mitigation measures used by the securitisation are 
fully funded and available at all times. 
 
 
 
563  
For example, associated savings plans designed to repay principal at maturity. 
564  
Such as credit and interest rate risks. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-390  
Payment Priorities and Observability 
 
2.5 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the priorities of payments for all liabilities 
in all circumstances at the time of securitisation are clearly defined, and that a written 
independent legal opinion565 on the enforceability of the payment priorities is obtained.  
 
2.6 
To ensure that junior noteholders do not have inappropriate payment 
preference over senior noteholders that are due and payable, throughout the life of a 
securitisation, or, where there are multiple securitisations backed by the same pool of 
credit claims or receivables, throughout the life of the securitisation programme, a 
Reporting Bank must ensure that junior liabilities do not have payment preference over 
senior liabilities which are due and payable. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the 
securitisation is not structured as a “reverse” cash flow waterfall such that junior liabilities 
are paid where due and payable senior liabilities have not been paid. 
 
2.7 
To help provide investors with full transparency over any changes to the cash 
flow waterfall, payment profile or priority of payments that might affect a securitisation, a 
Reporting Bank must ensure that all triggers affecting the cash flow waterfall, payment 
profile or priority of payments of the securitisation are clearly and fully disclosed in both 
the offering documents and investor reports, with information in the investor report that 
clearly identifies any breach of any such trigger, the likelihood for the breach to be 
reversed and the consequences of the breach. The Reporting Bank must ensure that 
investor reports contain information that allows investors to monitor the evolution over 
time of the indicators that are subject to triggers. The Reporting Bank must also satisfy 
itself that any triggers breached between payment dates are disclosed to investors on a 
timely basis in accordance with the terms and conditions of all underlying transaction 
documents.  
 
2.8 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that securitisations featuring a revolving period 
include provisions for appropriate early amortisation events or triggers of termination of 
the revolving period, or both, including – 
 
(a) 
deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; 
 
(b) 
a failure to acquire sufficient new underlying exposures of similar credit 
quality; and  
 
(c) 
the occurrence of an insolvency-related event with regard to the originator 
or the servicer.   
 
2.9 
Following the occurrence of a performance-related trigger, an event of default 
or an acceleration event, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the securitisation positions 
are repaid in accordance with a sequential amortisation priority of payments, in order of 
tranche seniority, and that there are no provisions requiring immediate liquidation of the 
underlying assets at market value.   
 
 
565  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal counsel, a Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel is independent of the parties executing the securitisation transaction. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-391  
2.10 
To assist investors in their ability to appropriately model the cash flow waterfall 
of the securitisation, a Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the originator makes 
available to investors, both before pricing of the securitisation and on an ongoing basis, a 
liability cash flow model or information on the cash flow provisions allowing appropriate 
modelling of the cash flow waterfall.  
 
2.11 
To ensure that debt forgiveness, forbearance, payment holidays and other asset 
performance remedies can be clearly identified, a Reporting Bank must ensure that  
policies and procedures, definitions, remedies and actions relating to delinquency, default 
or restructuring of underlying debtors are provided in clear and consistent terms, such 
that investors can clearly identify debt forgiveness, forbearance, payment holidays, 
restructuring and other asset performance remedies on an ongoing basis.  
 
 
 
Voting and Enforcement Rights 
 
2.12 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that upon the insolvency of an originator of the 
securitisation, the originator transfers all voting and enforcement rights related to the 
credit claims or receivables to the securitisation. The Reporting Bank must ensure that 
investors’ rights in the securitisation are clearly defined in all circumstances, including the 
rights of senior versus junior note holders. 
 
 
 
Documentation Disclosure and Legal Review 
 
2.13 
To help investors to fully understand the terms, conditions, legal and 
commercial information prior to investing in a new offering and to ensure that this 
information is set out in a clear and effective manner for all programmes and offerings, a 
Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that sufficient initial offering documentation566 and draft 
underlying 567  documentation are made available to investors, within a reasonably 
sufficient period of time prior to pricing, or when legally permissible, and such 
documentation are made available to potential investors, such that both investors and 
potential investors are provided with full disclosure of the legal and commercial information 
and comprehensive risk factors needed to make informed investment decisions. The 
Reporting Bank must also satisfy itself that final offering documents are made available to 
investors and potential investors from the closing date and all final underlying transaction 
documents shortly thereafter. The Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the relevant 
information in the documentation mentioned in this paragraph is presented in a manner 
that allows such information to be readily found, understood and used. 
 
2.14 
To ensure that all the securitisation’s underlying documentation has been 
subject to appropriate review prior to publication, a Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that 
the terms and documentation of the securitisation are reviewed by an appropriately 
 
566  
Such as a draft offering circular, draft offering memorandum, draft offering document or draft prospectus. 
567  
Such as any asset sale agreement, assignment, novation or transfer agreement; any servicing, backup 
servicing, administration or cash management agreement; any trust or management deed, security deed, 
agency agreement, account bank agreement, guaranteed investment contract, incorporated terms or 
master trust framework or master definitions agreement as applicable; any relevant inter-creditor 
agreements, swap or derivative documentation, subordinated loan agreements, start-up loan agreements 
and liquidity facility agreements; and legal opinions. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-392  
experienced and independent external legal practice568. The Reporting Bank must satisfy 
itself that investors are notified in a timely fashion of any changes in such documents that 
have an impact on the structural risks in the securitisation. 
 
 
 
Alignment of Interest 
 
2.15 
In order to align the interests of those responsible for the underwriting of the 
credit claims or receivables with those of investors, a Reporting Bank must ensure that 
the originator of the credit claims or receivables retains a material net economic exposure 
and demonstrates a financial incentive in the performance of these assets following their 
securitisation. 
 
 
Section 3:  Fiduciary and Servicer Risk 
 
 
 
Fiduciary and Contractual Responsibilities 
 
3.1 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that servicers in a securitisation have 
extensive workout expertise, thorough legal and collateral knowledge and a proven track 
record in loss mitigation. The Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that –  
 
(a) 
the servicer is able to demonstrate expertise in the servicing of the 
underlying credit claims or receivables, supported by a management team 
with extensive industry experience;  
(b) 
the servicer at all times acts in accordance with reasonable and prudent 
standards;  
(c) 
the servicer’s policies, procedures and risk management controls are well 
documented and adhere to good market practices and relevant regulatory 
regimes, and where the servicer is not a bank, this is substantiated by a 
review by an external party; and 
(d) 
the servicer has in place strong systems and reporting capabilities, and 
where the servicer is not a bank, this is substantiated by a review by an 
external party.  
 
3.2 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that both the initial offering and all underlying 
documentation contain provisions facilitating the timely resolution of conflicts between 
different classes of note holders by the trustees, to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
 
3.3 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the party or parties with fiduciary 
responsibility to the securitisation and to investors demonstrate sufficient skills and 
resources to comply with their duties of care in the administration of the securitisation 
vehicle, and to act on a timely basis in the best interests of securitisation note holders. 
 
 
568  
For example, a legal counsel already instructed by one of the transaction parties, such as the arranger or 
the trustee. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-393  
3.4 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that remuneration to parties with fiduciary 
responsibility towards investors and to servicers is such that these parties are incentivised 
and able to meet their responsibilities in full and on a timely basis.  
 
 
Transparency to Investors 
 
3.5 
To help provide full transparency to investors, assist investors in the conduct of 
their due diligence and to prevent investors being subject to unexpected disruptions in 
cash flow collections and servicing, a Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the contractual 
obligations, duties and responsibilities of all parties with a fiduciary responsibility and all 
ancillary service providers to the securitisation, are defined clearly both in the initial 
offering and all underlying documentation. The Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that 
provisions are documented for the replacement of servicers, bank account providers, 
derivatives counterparties and liquidity providers in the event of failure or non-
performance or insolvency or other deterioration of creditworthiness of any such 
counterparty to the securitisation.  
 
3.6 
To enhance transparency and visibility over all receipts, payments and ledger 
entries at all times, a Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the performance reports to 
investors distinguish and report the securitisation’s income and disbursements, which 
comprises scheduled principal, redemption principal, scheduled interest, prepaid principal, 
repurchases, past due interest and fees and charges, delinquent, defaulted and 
restructured amounts under debt forgiveness, payment holidays, deferment, and 
forbearance, including accurate accounting for amounts attributable to principal and 
interest deficiency ledgers. 
 
 
Section 4:  Additional Criteria 
 
 
Credit Risk of Underlying Exposures 
 
4.1 
At the portfolio cut-off date, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the underlying 
exposures after recognising the effects of credit risk mitigation, are assigned a risk weight 
under the SA(CR) that is equal to or smaller than – 
  
(a) 
40% on a value-weighted average exposure basis for the portfolio where 
the exposures are regulatory RRE exposures;  
 
(b) 
50% on an individual exposure basis where the exposure is a regulatory 
CRE exposure, is in the other real estate asset sub-class as defined in 
paragraph 7.3.1(k)(iii), or is in the ADC asset sub-class as defined in 
paragraph 7.3.1(k)(i); 
 
(c) 
75% on an individual exposure basis where the exposure belongs to the 
regulatory retail asset class pursuant to paragraph 7.3.1(i); or  
 
(d) 
100% on an individual exposure basis for any other exposure. 
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-394  
 
Granularity of the Underlying Pool 
 
4.2 
At the portfolio cut-off date, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the aggregated 
value of all exposures to a single obligor do not exceed 1% of the aggregated outstanding 
exposure value of all exposures in the portfolio. However, subject to the Authority’s prior 
approval, in the case of corporate exposures and if the country or jurisdiction where 
exposures in the underlying pool belong has structurally concentrated corporate loan 
markets available for securitisation, the threshold may be increased to 2%, provided –  
 
(a)  the originator retains the subordinated tranche or, where there are 
multiple tranches, all subordinated tranches, as the case may be, that 
form loss-absorbing credit enhancement, as defined in paragraph 
7.6.35(a), and  
 
(b)  such subordinated tranche or tranches cover at least the first 10% of 
losses.  
 
For the purposes of this paragraph, the Reporting Bank acting as an originator must not 
apply the alternative capital treatment for STC securitisations for any subordinated tranche 
that satisfies the requirements in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) that it retains.

CRITERIA 
FOR 
SIMPLE,

AND 
COMPARABLE 
(STC) 
SECURITISATIONS THAT ARE ABCP PROGRAMMES (SHORT-TERM STC CRITERIA) 
 
 
Section 1: Overview 
 
1.1 
In this Annex – 
 
(a)  any reference to an ABCP conduit acquiring an interest in an asset in an 
ABCP transaction refers to – 
 
(i)  
in the case where the law governing the transaction by which the 
interest was acquired recognises the acquisition of beneficial 
interests, a beneficial interest; and 
 
(ii)  in the case where the law governing the transaction by which the 
interest was acquired does not recognise the acquisition of beneficial 
interests, an interest; and 
 
(b)  any reference to an ABCP conduit being transferred an interest in an asset 
in an ABCP transaction refers to – 
 
(i)  
in the case where the law governing the transaction by which the 
interest is transferred recognises the acquisition of beneficial 
interests, a beneficial interest; and 
 
(ii)  in the case where the law governing the transaction by which the 
interest is transferred does not recognise the acquisition of beneficial 
interests, an interest.  
 
 
Section 2:  Asset Risk 
 
Nature of Assets (Conduit Level Criteria) 
 
2.1 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the ABCP programme sponsor has –  
 
(a)  made representations and warranties to ABCP programme investors that 
ABCP transactions in the ABCP programme meet the criteria in paragraph 
2.3 of this Annex; and 
 
(b) 
explained to ABCP programme investors how ABCP transactions in the 
ABCP programme meet the criteria in paragraph 2.3 of this Annex on an 
overall basis, or if required by the Authority, the Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the ABCP programme sponsor has explained to ABCP 
programme investors how each ABCP transaction in the ABCP programme 
meets the criteria in paragraph 2.3 of this Annex.  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-396  
2.2 
A Reporting Bank is not precluded from considering any securitisation arising 
from any of the following as an STC securitisation:  
 
(a) 
an ABCP conduit that finances ABCP transactions of different underlying 
asset types, provided that each individual ABCP transaction in the ABCP 
programme involving the ABCP conduit is homogeneous in terms of asset 
type as assessed in accordance with paragraph 2.4 of this Annex; 
 
(b) 
an ABCP conduit of an ABCP programme for which there is programme-
wide credit enhancement, regardless of whether such enhancement 
technically creates a resecuritisation exposure. 
 
 
Nature of Assets (Transaction Level Criteria) 
 
2.3 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the assets underlying the ABCP transaction 
are credit claims or receivables that – 
 
(a) 
are homogeneous in terms of asset type;  
 
(b) 
are not securitisation exposures; 
 
(c)  have contractually identified periodic payment streams relating to 
rental569, principal, interest, or principal and interest payments; and 
 
(d) 
reference interest payments or discount rates based on commonly 
encountered market interest rates570, but do not reference complex or 
complicated formulae or exotic derivatives. For the purposes of this sub-
paragraph, an “exotic instrument” is defined as a financial asset or 
instrument with features making it more complex than plain vanilla 
products571.  
 
2.4 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.3(a) of this Annex, a Reporting Bank may only 
assess the credit claims or receivables underlying a ABCP transaction to be homogeneous 
in terms of asset type where all of the following criteria are satisfied: 
  
(a) 
the nature of exposures underlying the ABCP transaction are such that 
ABCP programme investors would not need to analyse and assess 
materially different legal or credit risk factors, or both, and risk profiles 
when carrying out risk analysis and due diligence checks; 
 
569  
Payments on operating and financing leases are considered to be rental payments rather than payments 
of principal and interest.   
570  
Commonly encountered market interest rates may include rates reflective of a lender’s cost of funds, to 
the extent that sufficient data are provided to investors to allow them to assess their relation to other 
market rates. Examples of these include – 
(a)  interbank rates and rates set by monetary policy authorities, such as Libor, Euribor and the federal 
funds rate; and 
(b)  sectoral rates reflective of a lender’s cost of funds, such as internal interest rates that directly reflect 
the market costs of a bank’s funding or that of a subset of institutions.  
571  
As defined by the Global Association of Risk Professionals. Interest rate caps or floors would not be 
automatically considered exotic derivatives. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-397  
(b) 
the exposures underlying the ABCP transaction have common risk drivers, 
including similar risk factors and risk profiles; 
  
(c) 
credit claims or receivables included in the ABCP transaction have 
obligations that are consistent with market practices, in terms of rights to 
payments or income, or both, from assets and that result in a periodic and 
well-defined stream of payments to investors. The Reporting Bank must 
deem credit card facilities to result in a periodic and well-defined stream 
of payments to investors of the ABCP programme for the purposes of this 
criterion; 
  
(d) 
repayment of exposures of ABCP programme investors rely on the 
principal and interest proceeds from the securitised assets;  
 
(e)  despite sub-paragraph (d), partial reliance on refinancing or re-sale of the 
asset securing the exposure may occur, provided that re-financing is 
sufficiently distributed within the pool, and the residual values on which 
the repayment relies through re-financing or re-sale of assets are 
sufficiently low. 
 
To avoid doubt, the criterion on homogeneity in this paragraph does not prevent an ABCP 
transaction that is a securitisation of equipment leases or a securitisation of auto loans 
and leases from being considered as a STC securitisation; 
 
2.5 
To avoid doubt, the criterion in paragraph 2.3(b) of this Annex does not prevent 
an ABCP transaction in which an ABCP conduit acquires an interest in the assets underlying 
the ABCP transaction in the form of a note which itself may be a securitisation exposure, 
from being considered as a STC securitisation, as long as such a securitisation exposure 
is not subject to any further tranching572. 
 
 
Asset Performance History (Conduit Level Criteria) 
 
2.6 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the ABCP programme sponsor – 
 
(a)  makes available to ABCP programme investors sufficient loss performance 
data, including delinquency and default data, for credit claims and 
receivables with substantially similar risk characteristics to the assets 
underlying the ABCP transactions of the ABCP programme, for a time 
period long enough to permit meaningful evaluation of risk. For the 
purposes of this sub-paragraph, the ABCP programme sponsor may 
provide such data on a stratified basis573; and 
 
 
572  
Where such a securitisation exposure is not subject to any further tranching, it would have the same 
economic characteristic as the ABCP conduit purchasing the assets underlying the ABCP transaction with a 
refundable purchase price discount. 
573  
For example, by – 
(a) providing materially relevant data on the assets underlying the ABCP transactions of the ABCP 
programme (such as outstanding balances, industry sector, obligor concentrations and maturities); 
and 
(b) providing materially relevant data on the credit quality and performance of the ABCP transactions of 
the ABCP programme, allowing investors to identify collections, and as applicable, debt restructuring, 
forgiveness, forbearance, payment holidays, repurchases, delinquencies and defaults. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-398  
(b)  discloses to ABCP programme investors the sources of the data provided 
under sub-paragraph (a), and the basis for claiming substantial similarity 
of risk characteristics. 
 
 
Asset Performance History (Transaction Level Criteria) 
 
2.7 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that – 
 
(a)  verifiable loss performance data, including delinquency and default data, 
is available to the ABCP sponsor for credit claims and receivables with 
substantially similar risk characteristics to the assets underlying the ABCP 
transaction, for a time period long enough to permit meaningful evaluation 
of risk by the ABCP sponsor, including for conducting due diligence and 
calculating expected loss in different stress scenarios;  
 
(b) the ABCP programme sponsor, and the original lender who underwrote the 
assets underlying the ABCP transaction, have sufficient experience in the 
risk analysis and underwriting of exposures or transactions with 
underlying exposures similar to those securitised;  
 
(c) 
the ABCP programme sponsor has well-documented procedures and 
policies regarding the underwriting of transactions and the ongoing 
monitoring of the performance of the assets underlying the ABCP 
transaction;  
 
(d)  the ABCP programme sponsor ensures that the ABCP transaction seller 
and all other parties involved in the origination of the assets underlying 
the ABCP transaction, have experience in originating same or similar 
assets, and are supported by a management with industry experience 
relevant to the type of assets being originated; and 
 
 
(e) the ABCP programme sponsor has provided confirmation to ABCP 
programme investors that the performance history of the originator of the 
securitisation, and the original lender who underwrites the assets for 
substantially similar claims or receivables to those being securitised, has 
been established for a time period that is – 
  
(i)  
long enough to permit meaningful evaluation of risk; and 
 
(ii)  no shorter than a period of 3 years for retail exposures and 
purchased retail receivables, and no shorter than a period of 5 years 
for exposures that are not retail exposures. 
 
 
Payment Status (Conduit Level Criteria) 
 
2.8 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the ABCP programme sponsor has, to 
the best of its knowledge and based on representations from the ABCP transaction sellers 
under the ABCP programme, made representations and warranties to ABCP programme

after the acquisition by the ABCP conduit of the interests of the 
assets under the ABCP transaction, will not be actively selected or 
actively managed;  
 
(c) 
the ABCP programme sponsor has ensured, and obtained a written

seller, as active management provided that such credit claims or receivables concerned 
are not added or substituted on a discretionary basis.  
 
2.15 
The requirement in paragraph 2.13(c)(iii) of this Annex does not apply to a 
Reporting Bank where the securitisation is in a country or jurisdiction whose legal 
framework provides a means, other than by way of a transfer of the credit claims or 
receivables, to effect a true sale in relation to the securitisation, provided that the 
Reporting Bank satisfies itself that the underlying credit claims or receivables meet the 
requirements in paragraph 2.13(c)(i), (ii) and (iv) of this Annex. The Reporting Bank must 
satisfy itself that for a securitisation in relation to which a true sale is effected by means 
other than a transfer of the credit claims or receivables, the ABCP transaction seller – 
 
575  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal opinion, a Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel providing the legal opinion should be independent of the parties involved in the origination 
and transfer of assets underlying the ABCP transaction. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-403  
 
(a)

on the relevant risk characteristics of the credit claims or receivables to 
be transferred to the ABCP conduit through the ABCP transaction; and 
 
(b) 
on an ongoing basis, provides the ABCP programme sponsor with timely 
data at the level of each credit claim or receivable subject to compliance 
with applicable laws governing the provision of such information or 
granular pool stratification data on the risk characteristics of the 
underlying pool. 
 
Where the ABCP transaction seller delegates any of these tasks set out in sub-paragraphs

(a) 
such liquidity facilities and credit protection fully protect ABCP programme 
investors against risks (including credit risks, liquidity risks and any 
material dilution risks) of the underlying asset pools financed by the ABCP 
conduit, thus irrevocably and unconditionally ensuring that the liabilities 
of the ABCP programme will be paid in full and on time; 
 
(b) 
subject to paragraph 3.2 of this Annex, where such liquidity facilities and 
credit protection support are provided by more than one ABCP programme 
sponsor, the majority of the support provided by the ABCP programme 
sponsors (assessed in terms of coverage) is provided by a single ABCP 
programme sponsor (referred to as the “main sponsor”); 
 
(c) 
the terms of the liquidity facilities must satisfy all of the following 
conditions: 
 
(i) 
identify events the occurrence upon which the creditworthiness of 
the ABCP programme sponsor are deemed to be affected; 
 
(ii) 
provide that upon the occurrence of the events identified in sub-
paragraph (c)(i), the ABCP programme sponsor is obliged to – 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

programme investors; or  
 
(B) replace itself with another liquidity provider without any change 
to the terms of the liquidity facilities provided;  
 
(iii) provide that if the ABCP programme sponsor does not renew its 
funding commitment for the entire ABCP conduit or for a specific

commitment to the ABCP conduit or specific ABCP transaction, 
as the case may be, in cash at least 30 days prior to the 
expiration of the liquidity facility; and 
 
(B) the ABCP programme must not purchase any new receivables 
under the ABCP conduit or ABCP transaction, as the case may 
be, supported by the affected funding commitment; 
 
(d) 
the ABCP programme sponsor provides ABCP programme investors with 
full information on the terms of the liquidity facilities and credit protection 
support that it provides to the ABCP conduit or to the ABCP transactions 
of the ABCP programme, as the case may be. Despite the above, the ABCP 
programme sponsor may redact certain information pertaining to the 
ABCP transactions only where this is necessary to comply with laws and 
regulations in relation to confidentiality. 
 
3.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 3.1(b) of this Annex –   
 
(a) 
a Reporting Bank need not satisfy itself that the criterion in paragraph 
3.1(b) of this Annex is met for the duration taken to replace the main 
sponsor, where the main sponsor has to be replaced due to a material 
deterioration in its credit standing; and 
 
(b) 
any liquidity facilities and credit protection support provided by an ABCP 
transaction seller must not be considered for the purposes of determining 
if a single ABCP programme sponsor is the main sponsor.  
 
 
Redemption Cash Flows (Transaction Level Criteria) 
 
3.3 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that, unless the pool of credit claims or 
receivables underlying the ABCP transaction is sufficiently granular and has sufficiently 
distributed repayment profiles, the ABCP programme sponsor ensures that the repayment 
of the credit claims or receivables underlying the ABCP transaction – 
 
(a) 
relies primarily on the general ability and willingness of the respective 
obligor(s) to pay, rather than the possibility of the sale or refinancing of 
the credit claims or receivables by the obligor in order to repay the 
liabilities; and 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-406  
(b) 
does not primarily rely on the drawing of an external liquidity facility 
provided to this transaction.  
 
To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must not consider any liquidity facilities or credit 
protection support provided by the ABCP programme sponsor in determining whether the 
criteria in this paragraph is met.

Criteria) 
 
3.5 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the ABCP programme sponsor ensures 
that any payment risk arising from different interest rate and currency profiles of assets 
and liabilities that are not mitigated at the ABCP transaction level, or that arise at the 
ABCP conduit level, is appropriately mitigated. To avoid doubt, the term “appropriately 
mitigated” does not require a perfect hedge. A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the 
ABCP programme sponsor ensures that hedging transactions used to mitigate such interest 
rate and foreign currency risks are –  
 
(a) 
documented according to industry-standard master agreements; and 
 
(b) 
conducted with – 
 
(i)  
derivatives used for hedging purposes; or

mitigating measures are specifically created and used for the 
purpose of hedging an individual and specific risk, and are fully 
funded and available at all times. 
 
3.6 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the ABCP programme sponsor provides 
ABCP programme investors with the following information in a timely and regular manner 
to allow them to assess how the payment risk arising from differences in the interest rate 
and currency profiles of the assets and liabilities under the ABCP programme are 
appropriately mitigated through the life of the ABCP programme (whether at the level of 
each ABCP transaction and at the level of the ABCP conduit): 
 
(a) 
quantitative information on hedging transactions, including the fraction of 
notional amounts that are hedged;  
 
(b) 
sensitivity analysis that illustrates the effectiveness of the hedge under 
extreme but plausible scenarios. 
 
 
Currency and Interest Rate Asset and Liability Mismatches (Transaction level 
Criteria) 
 
3.7 
A Reporting Bank must satisfy itself that the ABCP programme sponsor ensures 
that any interest rate and foreign currency risks of the assets underlying the ABCP 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

and foreign currency risks of assets underlying the ABCP transaction are –  
 
(a) 
documented according to industry-standard master agreements; and 
 
(b) 
conducted with – 
 
(i)  
derivatives used for hedging purposes; or

risk-mitigating measures other than derivatives where such risk-
mitigating measures are specifically created and used for the 
purpose of hedging an individual and specific risk, and are fully 
funded and available at all times.

3.8 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that – 
 
(a) 
the commercial paper issued by the ABCP programme does not include 
features, including extension options, which may extend the final maturity

commercial paper does not belong exclusively to ABCP programme 
investors;  
 
(b) 
the ABCP programme sponsor has made representations and warranties 
to ABCP programme investors that every ABCP transaction of the ABCP 
programme meets the criteria set out in paragraph 3.9 of this Annex and 
that the ABCP programme sponsor has the ability to appropriately analyse 
the cash flow waterfall of every ABCP transaction of the ABCP programme 
that qualifies as a securitisation; and 
 
(c) 
the ABCP programme sponsor has made available to ABCP programme 
investors a summary illustrating the functioning of –

the cash flow waterfall of every ABCP transaction of the ABCP 
programme that is a securitisation; and

the credit enhancement within the ABCP programme provided at the 
level of the ABCP conduit and at the level of each ABCP transaction 
of the ABCP programme.

by the ABCP conduit, are clearly defined, and that a written independent 
legal opinion578 on the enforceability of the payment priorities is obtained;  
 
(b)  the junior liabilities do not have payment preference over senior liabilities 
which are due and payable;

to easily ascertain the likelihood of a trigger being breached 
and any such breach being reversed;  
 
(iii) any breaches of such triggers that occur between payment dates of 
the securitisation are disclosed to the ABCP programme sponsor on 
a timely basis in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
transaction documents; and 
 
 
(iv) the ABCP programme sponsor receives, both prior to the ABCP 
conduit acquiring an interest in the ABCP transaction and thereafter 
on an ongoing basis, a liability cash flow model or information on the 
cash flow provisions allowing appropriate modelling of the cash flow 
waterfall; 
 
(d) 
where an ABCP transaction transfers an interest that is a securitisation 
position to the ABCP conduit –  
 
(i) 
the interest transferred to the ABCP conduit always ranks senior to 
any other position in the securitisation structure; and

provisions for appropriate early amortisation events or triggers of 
termination of the revolving period, or both, including – 
 
578  
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal counsel, a Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel is independent of the parties executing the ABCP transaction. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-409  
 
(i) 
deterioration in the credit quality of the exposures underlying the 
ABCP transaction;

of the ABCP conduit) in order to finance the ABCP transactions of the ABCP 
programme; 
 
(b) 
the exposure-weighted average maturity of all the underlying assets 
financed by the ABCP conduit, which must be calculated as follows:   
 
(i)  
Step 1: Taking an exposure-weighted average of residual maturities 
of the assets underlying each ABCP transaction in the ABCP 
programme. For an ABCP transaction for which it is impractical for 
the ABCP programme sponsor to calculate this statistic579, the ABCP 
programme sponsor may use the maximum maturity of the assets 
in the pool of assets underlying the ABCP transaction as defined in 
the legal agreements governing the ABCP transaction580;  
 
(ii) 
Step 2: Taking an exposure-weighted average of –  
 
(A)  the ABCP transaction-level exposure-weighted average; or  
 
(B)  the maximum maturity of assets in the pool of assets 
underlying the ABCP transaction, 
 
for each ABCP transaction, as the case may be, as calculated in Step 1.

Section 5:  Additional Criteria 
 
 
Credit Risk of Underlying Exposures (Transaction Level Criteria) 
 
5.1 
A Reporting Bank must ensure, as at the date of acquisition by the ABCP conduit 
of the interests of the assets under an ABCP transaction, that the assets underlying the 
ABCP transaction after recognising the effects of credit risk mitigation, are assigned a risk 
weight under the SA(CR) that is equal to or smaller than – 
  
(a) 
40% on a value-weighted average exposure basis for the portfolio where 
the exposures are regulatory RRE exposures;  
 
(b) 
50% on an individual exposure basis where the exposure is a regulatory 
CRE exposure, is in the other real estate asset sub-class as defined in 
paragraph 7.3.1(k)(iii), or is in the ADC asset sub-class as defined in 
paragraph 7.3.1(k)(i); 
 
(c) 
75% on an individual exposure basis where the exposure belongs to the 
regulatory retail asset class pursuant to paragraph 7.3.1(i); or  
 
(d) 
100% on an individual exposure basis for any other exposure. 
 
 
Granularity of the Underlying Pool (Conduit Level Criteria) 
 
5.2 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that, as at the date of acquisition by the ABCP 
conduit of the interests of the assets under any ABCP transaction, the aggregated value 
of all exposures to a single obligor do not exceed 2% of the aggregated outstanding 
exposure value of all exposures underlying the ABCP programme. However, subject to the 
Authority’s prior approval, in the case of corporate exposures and if the country or 
jurisdiction where exposures in the underlying pool belong has structurally concentrated 
corporate loan markets available for securitisation, the threshold may be increased to 3%, 
provided that – 
 
(a) 
the ABCP transaction seller or ABCP transaction sellers, as the case may 
be, or the ABCP programme sponsor, retains the subordinated tranche or, 
where there are multiple tranches, all subordinated tranches, as the case 
may be, that form loss absorbing credit enhancement, as defined in 
paragraph 7.6.35(a); and  
 
(b) 
the subordinated tranche or tranches referred to in sub-paragraph (a) 
cover at least the first 10% of losses.  
 
For the purposes of this paragraph, the Reporting Bank must not apply the alternative 
capital treatment for STC securitisations for any subordinated tranche that satisfies the 
requirements in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) that the Reporting Bank retains in its capacity 
as a ABCP transaction seller or a ABCP programme sponsor.

Annex 7AG 
 
ILLUSTRATION ON THE RECOGNITION OF DILUTION RISK WHEN APPLYING THE 
SEC-IRBA TO SECURITISATION EXPOSURES 
 
 
Section 1:  Illustrative Example – Recognition of Dilution Risk Assuming a 
Common Waterfall for Default and Dilution Losses 
 
1.1 
Assume a Reporting Bank is using the SEC-IRBA to calculate the credit risk-
weighted exposure amount for the securitisation exposures to a securitisation with an 
underlying pool comprising purchased corporate receivables, and for which the loss 
allocation process does not distinguish between losses resulting from defaults and dilution 
within the underlying pool (i.e. common waterfall for default and dilution losses). In 
accordance with paragraph 7.6.32, the Reporting Bank must determine KIRB for dilution 
risk and default risk respectively, and combine them into a single KIRB prior to applying the 
SEC-IRBA. 
 
1.2 
For the purposes of this illustration, the underlying pool of the securitisation is 
comprised of exposures with uniform size, uniform PD, uniform LGD and uniform maturity, 
and is characterised as follows: 
 
(a) 
Pool of $1,000,000 of purchased corporate receivables; 
 
(b) 
N = 100; 
 
(c) 
M = 2.5 years584; 
 
(d) 
PDdil = 0.55%; 
 
(e) 
LGDdil = 100%; 
 
(f) 
PD = 0.95%; 
 
(g) 
LGD = 45%. 
 
1.3 
For the purposes of this illustration, the capital structure of the securitisation is 
composed of 3 tranches and is characterised as follows: 
 
(a) 
Tranche A is a senior note of $700,000; 
 
(b) 
Tranche B is a second-loss guarantee of $250,000; 
 
(c) 
Tranche C is a purchase discount of $50,000; 
 
(d) 
Final legal maturity of the transaction, and of all tranches, is 2.875 years. 
Hence, MT is calculated in accordance with paragraph 6.1 of Annex 7V, as 
follows: 
𝑀𝑇= 1 + (2.875 −1) ∙80% = 2.5 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠 
 
584  
For simplicity, the possibility to set Mdil = 1 year in accordance with paragraph 7.4.102(c)(ii) is not used in 
this example. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-417  
 
1.4 
A Reporting Bank must determine the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for 
each tranche under the SEC-IRBA as follows: 
 
(a) 
Step 1: Determine (1) the ratio of the IRB capital requirement for the 
underlying exposures in the pool in respect of dilution risk and the 
exposure amount of the underlying pool, KIRB, Dilution, and (2) the ratio of 
the IRB capital requirement for the underlying exposures in the pool in 
respect of default risk and the exposure amount of the underlying pool, 
KIRB,Default respectively as follows: 
 
(i) 
KIRB,Dilution = (ULDilution + ELDilution) / EADPool 
 
 
= [(EADPool x Kdil, cp x 12.5 x 8%) +  
(EADPool x PDdil x LGDdil) ] / EADPool 
 
= [($1,000,000 x 161.44% x 8%) +  
($1,000,000 x 0.55% x 100%)] / $1,000,000 
 
 
= 13.47% 
 
where – 
 
(A) “ULDilution” and “ELDilution” refer to unexpected losses and 
expected losses respectively arising from dilution risk; 
 
(B) “EADPool” refers to the EAD amount of the underlying pool; and 
 
(C) Kdil, cp is calculated in accordance with paragraph 7.4.102; 
 
 
(ii) 
KIRB,Default    = (ULDefault + ELDefault) / EADPool 
 
 
 = [ (EADDefault x Kdf, cp x 12.5 x 8%) +  
(EADDefault x PD x LGD) ] / EADPool 
 
 = { [ (EADPool – ULDilution) x Kdf, cp x 12.5 x 8% ] +  
[ (EADPool – ULDilution) x PD x LGD) ] } / EADPool 
 
 = { [ ($1,000,000 - $129,200) x 90.62% x 8% ] +  
[ ($1,000,000 - $129,200) x 0.95% x 45%) ] } 
/ $1,000,000 
 
 
= 6.69% 
 
where – 
 
(A) “ULDefault” and “ELDefault” refer to unexpected losses and expected 
losses respectively arising from default risk; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-418  
(B) “EADPool” refers to the EAD amount of the underlying pool; 
 
(C) “EADDefault” refers to the EAD arising from default risk, which is 
calculated as (EADPool – ULDilution) in accordance with paragraph 
2.12(a)(iii) and (b)(iii) of Annex 7T; and 
 
(D) Kdf, cp is calculated in accordance with paragraph 7.4.96(a); 
 
(b) 
Step 2: Combine KIRB,Dilution and KIRB,Default to determine KIRB for the 
underlying pool, as follows: 
 
 
KIRB= KIRB,Dilution + KIRB,Default = 13.47% + 6.69% = 20.16%;  
 
(c) 
Step 3: Apply the SEC-IRBA to the 3 tranches of the securitisation as 
follows: 
 
(i) 
determine pool-level parameters as follows: 
 
(A) N = 100, in accordance with paragraph 1.2(b) of this Annex; 
 
(B) LGDavg  = (LGD x KIRB,Default + LGDdil x KIRB,Dilution) 
 
 
/ KIRB 
 
 
      = [ (45% x 6.69%) + (100% x 13.47%) ] / 20.16% 
 
 
      = 81.75% 
 
(ii) 
determine tranche-level parameters for each tranche as follows: 
 
(A) MT = 2.5 for all 3 tranches, in accordance with paragraph 1.3(d) 
of this Annex; 
 
(B) tranche attachment and detachment points as follows:

Section 2:  Illustrative Example – Recognition of Dilution Risk Assuming Separate 
Waterfalls for Default and Dilution Losses 
 
2.1 
Assume a Reporting Bank is using the SEC-IRBA to calculate the credit risk-
weighted exposure amount for the securitisation exposures to a securitisation with an 
underlying pool comprising purchased corporate receivables, and for which the loss 
allocation process distinguishes between losses resulting from defaults and dilution within 
the underlying pool (i.e. separate waterfalls for default and dilution losses). This means 
that for the determination of the risk of a specific tranche, it is not only relevant to 
determine what losses might be realised within the pool, but also if such losses result from 
a default event or a dilution event. 
 
2.2 
As the SEC-IRBA assumes that there is one common waterfall for default and 
dilution losses, it cannot be applied to the case described in paragraph 2.1 of this Annex 
without adjustments. This example illustrates one possible scenario and a possible 
adjustment specific to this scenario. Despite this example, a Reporting Bank must consult 
the Authority as to how KIRB must be calculated where default risk and dilution risk are 
subject to separate waterfalls, in accordance with paragraph 7.6.32. 
 
2.3 
Assume that the underlying pool of the securitisation is as described in 
paragraph 1.2 of this Annex. 
 
2.4 
Assume that the capital structure of the securitisation is composed of 3 tranches 
and is characterised as follows: 
 
(a) 
Tranche A is a senior note of $950,000; 
 
(b) 
Tranche C is a purchase discount of $50,000; 
 
(c) 
Tranche A and Tranche C will cover both default and dilution losses; 
 
(d) 
Tranche B is a fully cash-collateralised second-loss guarantee of $250,000 
that covers only dilution losses exceeding a threshold of $50,000, up to a 
maximum aggregated amount of $300,000;  
 
(e) 
MT of all tranches is 2.5 years.  
 
2.5 
The capital structure of the securitisation thus leads to the following 2 waterfalls: 
 
(a) 
default waterfall, comprising – 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-420  
 
(i) 
Tranche A, which is a senior note of $950,000; and 
 
(ii) 
Tranche C, which is a purchase discount of $50,000, subject to 
Tranche C not already having absorbed any realised dilution losses; 
 
(b) 
dilution waterfall, comprising – 
 
(i) 
Tranche A, which is a senior note of $700,000; 
 
(ii) 
Tranche B, which is a fully cash-collateralised second-loss guarantee 
of $250,000; and 
 
(iii) Tranche C, which is a purchase discount of $50,000, subject to 
Tranche C not already having absorbed any realised default losses. 
 
2.6 
A Reporting Bank must determine the credit RWE of Tranche C in accordance 
with paragraph 1.4 of this Annex, resulting in a credit RWE of $625,000. 
 
2.7 
For the purposes of calculating the credit RWE of Tranche B (the fully cash-
collateralised second loss guarantee), a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
limit KIRB to KIRB,Dilution as defined in paragraph 1.4(a) of this Annex, as 
Tranche B is exposed only to dilution risk, but not to default risk; and 
 
(b) 
assume that $50,000 of the securitised assets have already defaulted, 
hence – 
 
(i) 
Tranche C (the purchase discount) is no longer available as credit 
enhancement; and 
 
(ii) 
EAD of the underlying pool has been reduced to $950,000. To avoid 
doubt, the Reporting Bank may assume that the KIRB calculated in 
respect of Tranche B is not affected by this assumed reduction in 
portfolio size. 
 
 
For the purposes of sub-paragraph (b)(i), Tranche C must not be 
recognised as credit enhancement for dilution risk to ensure a prudent 
treatment, given that the holder of Tranche B cannot be sure that Tranche 
C will still be available to absorb the first dilution losses when they are 
realised, as such credit enhancement might already be depleted due to 
earlier default losses.  
 
2.8 
The Reporting Bank must determine the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
for Tranche B under the SEC-IRBA as follows: 
 
(a) 
Step 1: Determine KIRB as follows: KIRB = KIRB,Dilution = 13.47%; 
 
(b) 
Step 2: Apply the SEC-IRBA to Tranche B as follows: 
 
(i) 
determine pool-level parameters as follows: 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-421  
(A) N = 100, in accordance with paragraph 1.2(b) of this Annex; 
 
(B) LGDavg  = LGDdil = 100%; 
 
(ii) 
determine tranche-level parameters as follows: 
 
(A) MT = 2.5 for all 3 tranches, in accordance with paragraph 2.4(e) 
of this Annex; 
 
(B) tranche attachment point = 0%; 
 
(C) tranche detachment point = $250,000 / $950,000 = 26.32%; 
 
(D) supervisory parameter p = 0.435, calculated in accordance with 
paragraph 7.6.42, for a non-senior tranche with a granular 
underlying pool comprising wholesale exposures; 
 
(iii) determine tranche-level risk weight of 886.94% in accordance with 
paragraphs 7.6.45 and 7.6.46, and credit RWE of $2,217,350 in 
accordance with paragraph 7.1.14. 
 
2.9 
The holder of Tranche A (senior note) will take all default losses not covered by 
the purchase discount and all dilution losses not covered by the purchase discount or the 
second-loss guarantee. A possible treatment for Tranche A under the SEC-IRBA would be 
to add KIRB,Default and KIRB,Dilution (as defined in paragraph 1.4 of this Annex), but not to 
recognise Tranche B as credit enhancement at all because it is covering only dilution risk. 
This approach is simple but fairly conservative. Therefore, a potential alternative treatment 
is set out in paragraphs 2.10 to 2.12 of this Annex. 
 
2.10 
The Reporting Bank may determine the credit RWE for Tranche A under the 
SEC-IRBA by – 
 
(a) 
calculating the credit RWE for Tranche A under the assumption that it is 
only exposed to losses resulting from defaults, i.e. that Tranche A is 
benefiting from a credit enhancement of $50,000; 
 
(b) 
calculating the credit RWE for Tranche C and a hypothetical Tranche A*, 
under the assumption that both are only exposed to dilution losses. 
Tranche A* should be assumed to absorb losses only when losses for the 
underlying pool are above $300,000 and up to $1,000,000. With respect 
to dilution losses, this approach would recognise that the holder of Tranche 
A cannot be sure that Tranche C will still be available to absorb the first 
dilution losses when they are realised, as such credit enhancement might 
already be depleted due to earlier default losses. Consequently, the holder 
of Tranche A may recognise the credit enhancement provided by Tranche 
C in the calculation of KIRB,default or KIRB,dilution, but not both;  
 
(c) 
summing up the credit RWE for – 
 
(i) 
Tranche A calculated under sub-paragraph (a); and 
 
(ii) 
hypothetical Tranche A* calculated under sub-paragraph (b); 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-422  
 
(d)  applying any adjustments to the credit RWE calculated under sub-
paragraph (c) as required under the risk weight floor –  
 
(i) 
if the securitisation transaction meets the requirements of paragraph 
7.6.93, as set out in paragraph 7.6.98; or 
 
(ii) 
otherwise, as set out in paragraph 7.6.46; and 
 
(e) 
applying any adjustments to the credit risk-weighted exposure amount 
calculated under sub-paragraph (c) and adjusted under sub-paragraph (d) 
to take into account the maximum risk weight that may be applied to 
Tranche A in accordance with paragraph 7.1.15(a). 
 
2.11 
For the purposes of the example set out in paragraph 2.10 of this Annex – 
 
(a) 
the credit enhancement provided by Tranche C was recognised in the 
default risk calculation, but a Reporting Bank may choose to recognise 
Tranche C in the dilution risk calculation instead; and 
 
(b) 
it was assumed that Tranche B explicitly covers dilution losses above 
$50,000 up to $300,000. If the Tranche B had instead been assumed to 
cover $250,000 of dilution losses after Tranche C has been depleted 
(irrespective of whether for dilution or default losses), then the holder of 
Tranche A must assume that he is exposed to dilution losses from 
$250,000 up to $1,000,000 (instead of from $0 to $50,000 and from 
$300,000 to $1,000,000). 
 
2.12 
The Reporting Bank must determine the credit RWE for Tranche A under the 
SEC-IRBA as follows: 
 
(a) Step 1: Calculate the credit RWE for Tranche A based on paragraph 2.10(a) 
of this Annex, as follows: 
 
(i) 
determine pool-level parameters as follows: 
 
(A) KIRB = KIRB,Default = 6.69%; 
 
 
(B) N = 100, in accordance with paragraph 1.2(b) of this Annex; 
 
(C) LGDavg = LGD = 45%; 
 
(ii) 
determine tranche-level parameters as follows: 
 
(A) MT = 2.5, in accordance with paragraph 2.4(e) of this Annex; 
 
(B) tranche attachment point = $50,000 / $1,000,000 = 5%; 
 
(C) tranche detachment point = 100%; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-423  
(D) supervisory parameter p = 0.334, calculated in accordance with 
paragraph 7.6.42, for a senior tranche with a granular 
underlying pool comprising wholesale exposures;  
 
(iii) determine tranche-level risk weight of 51.67% in accordance with 
paragraphs 7.6.45 and 7.6.46, and credit risk-weighted exposure 
amount of $490,865 in accordance with paragraph 7.1.14; 
 
(b) 
Step 2: Calculate the credit risk-weighted exposure amount for Tranche C 
and hypothetical Tranche A* based on paragraph 2.10(b) of this Annex, 
as follows: 
 
(i) 
determine pool-level parameters as follows: 
 
(A) KIRB = KIRB,Dilution = 13.47%; 
 
(B) N = 100, in accordance with paragraph 1.2(b) of this Annex; 
 
(C) LGDavg = LGDdil = 100%; 
 
(ii) 
determine tranche-level parameters for hypothetical Tranche A* as 
follows: 
 
(A) MT = 2.5, in accordance with paragraph 2.4(e) of this Annex; 
 
(B) tranche attachment point = 30%; 
 
(C) tranche detachment point = 100%; 
 
(D) supervisory parameter p = 0.511, calculated in accordance with 
paragraph 7.6.42, for a senior tranche with a granular 
underlying pool comprising wholesale exposures; 
 
(iii) determine tranche-level parameters for Tranche C as follows: 
 
(A) MT = 2.5, in accordance with paragraph 2.4(e) of this Annex; 
 
(B) tranche attachment point = 0%; 
 
(C) tranche detachment point = 5%; 
 
(D) supervisory parameter p = 0.435, calculated in accordance with 
paragraph 7.6.42, for a non-senior tranche with a granular 
underlying pool comprising wholesale exposures; 
 
(iv) for hypothetical Tranche A*, determine a tranche-level risk weight 
of 11.16% in accordance with paragraphs 7.6.45 and 7.6.46, and 
credit RWE of $78,120 in accordance with paragraph 7.1.14;  
 
(v) 
for Tranche C, determine tranche-level risk weight of 1250% in 
accordance with paragraphs 7.6.45 and 7.6.46, and credit RWE of 
$625,000 in accordance with paragraph 7.1.14; 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
7-424  
 
(c) 
Step 3: Sum up the credit risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated in 
sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), in accordance with paragraph 2.10(c) of this 
Annex, as follows:  
 
 
Credit RWE for Tranche A  
 
= $490,865 + $78,120 + $625,000  
= $1,193,985; and 
 
(d) 
Step 4: Determine that no adjustments to the credit risk-weighted amount 
for Tranche A are necessary in accordance with paragraph 2.10(d) and (e) 
of this Annex, as the implicit risk weight of Tranche A (calculated as 
$1,193,985 / $950,000 = 125.68%) is – 
 
(i) 
larger than the risk weight floor of 15%; and 
 
(ii) 
smaller than the exposure weighted-average risk weight applicable 
to the underlying exposures under the IRBA (taking into account the 
expected loss multiplied by 12.5) of 264.28%. 
 
 
 
To avoid doubt, the correct application of the overall risk weight floor is 
such that the intermediate results (in this case the risk weight for Tranche 
A*) are calculated without the floor and the floor is only applied in the last 
step (i.e. Step 4).

PART VIII: MARKET RISK   
 
 
Division 1: Overview of Market RWA Calculation 
 
Sub-division 1: Introduction 
 
8.1.1 
A Reporting Bank must calculate market RWA of a Reporting Bank as the sum 
of –  
 
(a)  12.5 times of –  
 
(i)  
in the case where the Reporting Bank only uses the SA(MR), its 
market risk capital requirements using the SA(MR) calculated in 
accordance with Division 2 of this Part;  
 
 
(ii) 
in the case where the Reporting Bank uses the IMA for one or more 
in-scope trading desks as specified in paragraph 8.3.17, the 
aggregation, calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.3.243, of its 
market risk capital requirements using the SA(MR) calculated in 
accordance with Division 2 of this Part, and its market risk capital 
requirements using the IMA calculated in accordance with Division 3 
of this Part; or 
 
(iii)  in the case where the Reporting Bank only uses the SSA(MR), its 
market risk capital requirement using the SSA(MR) calculated in 
accordance with Division 4 of this Part;  
 
(b) 
its Pillar 1 RWA surcharge calculated in accordance with paragraphs 8.1.39 
to 8.1.41; 
 
(c) 
12.5 times of its capital requirements for net short positions in funds, 
calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.1.11; and 
 
(d)  its CVA RWA calculated in accordance with Division 5 of this Part. 
 
 
Sub-division 2: Scope of Application for SA(MR), IMA and SSA(MR) 
 
8.1.2 
When calculating market risk capital requirements, a Reporting Bank must 
include –  
 
(a)  default risk, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, FX risk, 
commodities risk, and other risks arising from movements in market 
prices, for instruments in the trading book; and 
  
 
(b)  FX risk and commodities risk, for instruments in the banking book. 
 
 
8.1.3 
A Reporting Bank must include every transaction which falls within paragraph 
8.1.2, including any forward sale and forward purchase transaction, in its calculation of its 
market risk capital requirements from the date on which the transaction is entered into. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-2 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that it maintains an adequate level of capital to meet its 
market risk capital requirements at all times, including at the close of each business day601, 
and must take immediate measures to rectify the situation if it fails to meet the market 
risk capital requirements at any time. A Reporting Bank must also maintain risk 
management systems to ensure that intra-day exposures are not excessive.  
 
8.1.4 
To avoid doubt, where a Reporting Bank lends securities or posts securities as 
collateral, the Reporting Bank must calculate market risk capital requirements for the 
securities if the market risks of the securities remain with the Reporting Bank. 
 
8.1.5 
For the purposes of calculating a Reporting Bank’s market risk capital 
requirements for FX risk, a Reporting Bank may, subject to such directions as the Authority 
may issue and such conditions and restrictions as the Authority may impose, exclude 
certain positions from the calculation of its NOP in a currency (relevant currency), if the 
Reporting Bank meets all of the following conditions:  
 
(a) 
the position is of a structural nature which is non-dealing;602  
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank has taken or maintained the position, for the purposes 
of hedging, partially or totally, against the potential adverse effect of 
changes in an exchange rate on the Reporting Bank’s capital ratio; 
 
(c)  the exclusion is limited to the amount of the position that hedges the 
potential adverse effect of changes in an exchange rate on the Reporting 
Bank’s capital ratio; 
 
(d) 
the position which the Reporting Bank has excluded from the calculation 
of the Reporting Bank’s NOP in a currency must be excluded for a 
minimum continuous period of 6 months;   
 
(e) 
the Reporting Bank must implement a risk management framework and 
must have a risk management policy, for positions excluded from the 
calculation of the Reporting Bank’s NOP in relevant currencies;  
 
(f)  the Reporting Bank must ensure that the establishment of the position 
referred to in sub-paragraph (a) and any changes in NOP in the relevant 
currency, are in accordance with the Reporting Bank’s risk management 
policy referred to in sub-paragraph (e);  
 
(g) 
the Reporting Bank must provide the Authority its risk management policy 
referred to in sub-paragraph (e);  
 
(h)  the Reporting Bank must report to the Authority, the positions and 
amounts that are excluded from market risk capital requirements, and 
such other information required by the Authority. 
 
 
601  
A Reporting Bank should not window-dress to show significantly lower market risk positions on reporting 
dates. 
602  
For example, an investment in a subsidiary, branch or associate of the Reporting Bank, with a functional 
currency which is denominated in a currency other than the reporting currency of the Reporting Bank. The 
scope of a position that can be excluded is subject to the Authority’s specifications in its approval.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-3 
8.1.6 
A Reporting Bank must, in calculating its net open FX positions, exclude any 
position related to items that are deducted in the calculation of CET1 Capital, AT1 Capital 
or Tier 2 Capital. 
 
8.1.7 
A Reporting Bank must not, in calculating its market risk capital requirements, 
include holdings of capital instruments that are deducted in the calculation of CET1 Capital, 
AT1 Capital or Tier 2 Capital, or that are risk weighted at 1250%, which include – 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank’s own regulatory capital instruments;  
 
(b) 
other financial institutions’ regulatory capital instruments that are 
deducted in the Reporting Bank’s calculation of CET1 Capital, AT1 Capital 
or Tier 2 Capital; and  
 
(c) 
intangible assets.  
 
8.1.8 
A Reporting Bank with a consolidated trading book across the banking group 
may, in calculating its market risk capital requirements, include short and long positions 
in instruments in the trading book on a net basis, regardless of where they are booked, if 
–  
 
(a)   in the case where the Reporting Bank only uses the SA(MR), the 
instruments give rise to positions for which a full offset is allowed under 
the SA(MR); 
 
(b)  in the case where the Reporting Bank uses the IMA for one or more in-
scope trading desks as specified in paragraph 8.3.17, the instruments give 
rise to positions for which a full offset is allowed under the SA(MR); and 
 
(c)  in the case where the Reporting Bank only uses the SSA(MR), the 
instruments give rise to positions for which a full offset is allowed under 
the SSA(MR). 
 
8.1.9 
Despite paragraph 8.1.8, where there are legal or operational impediments to 
the quick repatriation of profits from a foreign subsidiary of the Reporting Bank or timely 
management of risks on a consolidated basis, the Reporting Bank must capture the 
individual positions arising from the entities that face such legal or operational 
impediments into the Reporting Bank’s market risk measurement system without any 
offsetting against positions arising from other banking group entities. The Authority retains 
the right to impose market risk capital requirements on a non-consolidated basis. A 
Reporting Bank must not conceal transactions in such a way as to avoid such transactions 
from being included in the Reporting Bank’s market risk measurement system on reporting 
dates. 
 
8.1.10 
A Reporting Bank must include all pre-settlement counterparty exposures 
arising from OTC derivative transactions, long settlement transactions, repo-style 
transactions and other transactions, booked in the trading book, in CCR-SA RWA, CCR-
IRBA RWA or CCP RWA under Part VII.603  
 
 
603  
The treatment for UST exposures is set out in Division 8 of Part VII.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-4 
8.1.11 
A Reporting Bank must not use the SA(MR), the SSA(MR) or the IMA to calculate 
market risk capital requirements for net short positions in funds where the Reporting Bank 
cannot look through or does not meet the requirements set out in paragraph 8.1.27(e). 
The Reporting Bank must calculate the capital requirements for a net short position in a 
fund as the net short position in the fund multiplied by 100%. 
 
 
Sub-division 3: Transitional Arrangements 
 
8.1.12 
A Reporting Bank must apply this Part, and all definitions used in this Part which 
are set out in Part II, for the purposes of compliance with capital adequacy ratio 
requirements in Part IV and public disclosure requirements in Part XI, with effect from 1 
January 2025. 
 
8.1.13  
A Reporting Bank must not apply this Part, and all definitions used in this Part 
which are set out in Part II, for the purposes of compliance with capital adequacy ratio 
requirements in Part IV and public disclosure requirements in Part XI, for the period from 
1 July 2024 to 31 December 2024 (both dates inclusive).    
 
8.1.14 
Subject to the modifications specified in paragraph 8.1.15, a Reporting Bank 
must continue to apply Part VIII and Annex 7AI of MAS Notice 637, including all directions 
issued and all approvals granted by the Authority in respect of Part VIII and Annex 7AI of 
MAS Notice 637, and such conditions and restrictions specified in the directions or 
approvals, as the case may be, and all definitions used in Part VIII and Annex 7AI which 
are set out in Part II of MAS Notice 637, in force immediately before 1 July 2024, for the 
purposes of compliance with capital adequacy ratio requirements in Part IV and public 
disclosure requirements in Part XI, for the period from 1 July 2024 to 31 December 2024 
(both dates inclusive). 
 
8.1.15 
The modification mentioned in paragraph 8.1.14 is that the following provision 
applies in place of paragraph 8.1.7 of MAS Notice 637 in force immediately before 1 July 
2024:  
 
“A Reporting Bank must calculate its market RWA as the sum of – 
 
(a) 
12.5 times of its market risk capital requirement calculated using the 
SA(MR) in accordance with Division 2 of Part VIII of MAS Notice 637 in 
force immediately before 1 July 2024; 
 
(b) 
12.5 times of its market risk capital requirement calculated using the IMA 
in accordance with Division 3 of Part VIII of MAS Notice 637 in force 
immediately before 1 July 2024; and 
 
(c) 
its CVA RWA calculated in accordance with Annex 7AI of MAS Notice 637 
in force immediately before 1 July 2024”.  
 
8.1.16 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must apply the transitional arrangements in 
paragraphs 8.1.12 to 8.1.15 wherever Part VIII or “market RWA” is referenced in this 
Notice, unless specified otherwise604. 
 
604  
For example, a Reporting Bank must apply paragraph 8.1.15 to any reference to “market RWA” in 
paragraphs 4.1.1 to 4.1.4 during the period referred to in paragraph 8.1.13. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-5 
Sub-division 4: Methods of Measuring Market Risks 
 
8.1.17 
A Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a)  use the SA(MR); or 
 
(b)  subject to the approval of the Authority, use –  
 
(i)  
the SSA(MR); 
 
(ii)  the IMA; or 
 
(iii)  a combination of both the SA(MR) and IMA, 
 
to calculate its market risk capital requirements.  
 
8.1.18 
The Authority may grant approval in writing for a Reporting Bank to use the 
SSA(MR) if the Authority is satisfied that the Reporting Bank maintains an overall market 
risk portfolio that is small and simple. In determining whether to grant a Reporting Bank 
approval to use the SSA(MR), the Authority will consider – 
 
(a) 
whether the Reporting Bank’s market RWA (excluding CVA RWA) 
calculated using the SSA(MR) exceeds S$200 million, or exceeds 2% of 
the Reporting Bank’s total RWA;  
 
(b) 
the complexity of the market risk exposures undertaken by the Reporting 
Bank605; 
 
(c) 
whether the Reporting Bank is identified as a G-SIB at the level of 
consolidation of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(d) 
whether the Reporting Bank or any of its banking group entities use the 
IMA to determine capital requirements for any trading desks; and 
 
(e) 
whether the Reporting Bank or any of its banking group entities hold any 
exposures in a CTP. 
 
8.1.19 
The Authority may revoke its approval for a Reporting Bank to use the SSA(MR) 
where the Reporting Bank’s market risk profile increases in size and complexity. 
 
8.1.20 
A Reporting Bank using the IMA for one or more of its trading desks that are 
in-scope of the IMA pursuant to paragraph 8.3.17 must calculate its market risk capital 
requirements using the SA(MR) for all of the following: 
 
(a) 
securitisation exposures; 
 
(b) 
equity investments in funds that cannot be looked through but are 
assigned to the trading book in accordance with the conditions set out in 
paragraph 8.1.27(e)(ii). 
 
605  
For example, whether the Reporting Bank is exposed to significant non-linear risks arising from options, 
especially from exotic options. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-6 
Sub-division 5: Determination of the Trading Book  
 
8.1.21 
A Reporting Bank must assign all instruments that meet the specifications for 
instruments in the trading book as defined in paragraphs 8.1.22 to 8.1.35 to its trading 
book. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must assign all instruments that are not in the 
trading book to the banking book. 
 
8.1.22 
A Reporting Bank may include an instrument in the trading book only when 
there is no legal impediment against selling or fully hedging it. 
 
8.1.23 
A Reporting Bank may only assign to the trading book an instrument that is 
subject to daily fair value, where any valuation change is recognised in the Reporting 
Bank’s P&L account under the Accounting Standards. To avoid doubt, this includes an 
instrument designated under the fair value option under the Accounting Standards.   
 
8.1.24 
Subject to paragraphs 8.1.22 and 8.1.23, a Reporting Bank must assign to the 
trading book any instrument that is held for one or more of the following purposes when 
the Reporting Bank first recognises it in its books, unless paragraph 8.1.27 specifically 
provides otherwise, and must also ensure that any instrument assigned to the trading 
book, including instruments reassigned to the trading book in accordance with paragraph 
8.1.36, is held for one or more of the following purposes on an ongoing basis:  
 
(a)  it is held by the Reporting Bank for short-term resale. To avoid doubt, 
periodic sale activity of an instrument by the Reporting Bank is insufficient 
for the Reporting Bank to consider an instrument as held for short-term 
resale;  
 
(b)  it is held by the Reporting Bank with the intention of profiting in the short 
term from actual or expected differences between its buying and selling 
price, or from other price or interest rate variations; 
 
(c)  it is held by the Reporting Bank to lock in arbitrage profits; 
 
(d)  it is held by the Reporting Bank to hedge risks that arise from instruments 
that are held for any of the purposes specified in sub-paragraph (a), (b) 
or (c). 
 
8.1.25 
Subject to paragraphs 8.1.22 and 8.1.23, a Reporting Bank must include all of 
the following instruments in the trading book, unless paragraph 8.1.27 specifically 
provides otherwise:  
 
(a) 
instruments in the CTP; 
 
(b) 
instruments that would give risk to a net short credit or equity position in 
the banking book606, 607;  
 
606  
A Reporting Bank will have a net short credit position in the banking book if the present value of the banking 
book increases when a credit spread of an issuer or group of issuers of debt increases. The Reporting Bank 
will have a net short equity position in the banking book when the present value of the banking book 
increases when an equity price decreases.   
607  
A Reporting Bank should continuously manage and monitor its banking book positions to ensure that any 
instrument that individually has the potential to create a net short credit or equity position in the banking 
book is not actually creating a non-negligible net short credit or equity position at any point in time.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-7 
  
(c) 
instruments 
resulting 
from 
underwriting 
commitments, 
where 
underwriting commitments are only for securities underwriting, and relate 
only to securities that the Reporting Bank expects to actually purchase on 
the settlement date. 
 
8.1.26 
A Reporting Bank must assign to the banking book any instrument which is not 
held for any of the purposes listed in paragraph 8.1.24 at inception and which is not within 
the scope of paragraph 8.1.25. The Reporting Bank must also ensure that any instrument 
assigned to the banking book, including instruments reassigned to the banking book in 
accordance with paragraph 8.1.36, is not held for any of the purposes listed in paragraph 
8.1.28 and not within the scope of paragraph 8.1.25, on an ongoing basis.  
 
8.1.27 
A Reporting Bank must assign to the banking book – 
 
(a)  unlisted equities; 
 
(b)  instruments designated for securitisation warehousing; 
 
(c)  direct holdings of real estate, and derivatives on direct holdings of real 
estate; 
 
(d)  credit exposures to 
individuals and 
small businesses, including 
commitments; 
 
(e)  equity investments in a fund, unless –  
 
(i)  
the Reporting Bank is able to look through the fund to its individual 
components and is able to obtain sufficient and frequent 
information608 on the composition of the fund, where the information 
is verified by an independent external party; or 
 
(ii)  the Reporting Bank obtains daily price quotes for the fund, and has 
access to the information contained in the fund’s mandate or in the 
regulations governing such funds; 
 
(f)  hedge funds; 
 
(g)  derivative instruments and funds, for which the underlying assets 
comprise instruments of types listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (f); and 
 
(h)  instruments held for the purposes of hedging a particular risk of a position 
in one or more instruments of types listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (g). 
 
8.1.28 
Subject to paragraphs 8.1.22, 8.1.23, 8.1.27, 8.1.30 and 8.1.31, a Reporting 
Bank must assign the following instruments to the trading book:   
 
(a)  instruments which are held within a business unit where the business 
unit’s objective is achieved by selling such instruments, and where the 
 
608  
A Reporting Bank should be able to obtain information on the composition of the fund on a daily basis.   


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-8 
instruments are measured at fair value through the P&L account under the 
Accounting Standards; 
 
(b)  instruments resulting from market-making activities; 
 
(c)  equity investments in a fund, other than those assigned to the banking 
book in accordance with paragraph 8.1.27(e); 
 
(d)  listed equities, other than any set of listed equities for which the Reporting 
Bank has obtained approval from the Authority to exclude from the trading 
book pursuant to paragraph 8.1.30 and that the Reporting Bank manages 
on a separate trading desk from proprietary or short-term trading 
instruments609;  
 
(e)  trading-related repo-style transactions, other than repo-style transactions 
that are entered into for liquidity management and that are valued at 
accrual for accounting purposes; 
 
(f)  options 610 , including embedded derivatives which are components of 
instruments that include a non-derivative host611 and which arise from 
instruments that the Reporting Bank has issued out of its banking book 
and that relate to credit or equity risk,     
 
unless the Reporting Bank has obtained approval from the Authority to treat an instrument 
otherwise in accordance with paragraph 8.1.30. 
 
8.1.29 
For liabilities issued out of a Reporting Bank’s banking book that contain 
embedded derivatives, the Reporting Bank must split the liability into 2 components, and 
separately recognise 2 components on its balance sheet, namely the embedded derivative 
which is assigned to the trading book and the residual liability which is retained in the 
banking book, without the use of internal risk transfers for the splitting612.   
 
8.1.30 
A Reporting Bank may assign an instrument listed in paragraph 8.1.28 to the 
banking book only where the Reporting Bank has obtained prior written approval from the 
Authority to do so. For the purposes of obtaining such approval, the Reporting Bank must 
provide evidence that the instrument is not held for any of the purposes specified in 
paragraph 8.1.24. Where the Reporting Bank has obtained such approval from the 
Authority, the Reporting Bank must document, on an ongoing basis, any assignment of 
instruments listed in paragraph 8.1.28 to the banking book. 
 
 
609  
Examples of equities that the Reporting Bank may exclude from the trading book include, but are not 
limited to, equity positions arising from deferred compensation plans, convertible debt securities, loan 
products with interest paid in the form of “equity kickers”, equity positions arising from a debt to equity 
swap made as part of the orderly realisation or restructuring of the debt, and life insurance products held 
by the Reporting Bank.  
610  
To avoid doubt, this includes an option that is used to manage FX risk in the banking book, unless the 
Reporting Bank has obtained approval from the Authority to assign such an option to the banking book.  
611  
An example of a non-derivative host is a liability issued out of a Reporting Bank’s banking book. An example 
of an embedded derivative is a floor to an equity-linked bond, as a floor to an equity-linked bond is an 
embedded option with an equity or equities underlying the option.   
612  
To avoid doubt, internal risk transfers would similarly not be required in the case where the embedded 
derivative is exercised or the residual liability is closed out. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-9 
8.1.31 
A Reporting Bank must provide evidence, to the satisfaction of the Authority, 
that an instrument assigned to the trading book is held for at least one of the purposes 
specified in paragraph 8.1.24, if required to do so by the Authority. Where the Reporting 
Bank has not provided evidence to the satisfaction of the Authority, or where the Authority 
is of the view that the instrument would customarily belong in the banking book, the 
Authority may require the Reporting Bank to assign the instrument to the banking book, 
unless the instrument falls under a category listed in paragraph 8.1.25.  
 
8.1.32 
A Reporting Bank must provide evidence, to the satisfaction of the Authority, 
that an instrument assigned to the banking book is not held for any of the purposes 
specified in paragraph 8.1.24, if required to do so by the Authority. Where the Reporting 
Bank has not provided evidence to the satisfaction of the Authority, or where the Authority 
is of the view that the instrument would customarily belong in the trading book, the 
Authority may require the Reporting Bank to assign the instrument to the trading book, 
unless the instrument falls under a category listed in paragraph 8.1.27. 
 
 
Documentation of instrument designation 
 
8.1.33 
A Reporting Bank must have policies, procedures, systems and documented 
practices for determining the assignment of instruments to the banking book or the trading 
book for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements, which must comply 
with the requirements in this Sub-division. 
 
8.1.34 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its risk control unit conducts an ongoing 
evaluation of whether the Reporting Bank’s initial assignment of instruments to the trading 
book and the banking book complies with the requirements in this Sub-division. 
 
8.1.35 
A Reporting Bank must document its compliance with the policies and 
procedures referred to in paragraph 8.1.33, subject such compliance to internal audit at 
least annually, and make the results of such internal audits available for review by the 
Authority upon request.  
 
 
Restrictions on moving instruments between the banking and trading books 
 
8.1.36 
 Subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 8.1.22 to 8.1.30, a Reporting 
Bank may reassign an instrument, after initial assignment, from the banking book to the 
trading book (or vice versa) in accordance with paragraphs 8.1.39 to 8.1.42.   
 
8.1.37 
A Reporting Bank may reassign an instrument from the banking book to the 
trading book (or vice versa), including through outright sales from the banking book to 
the trading book (or vice versa) at arm’s length, subject to all of the following conditions: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the reassignment of instruments 
between the banking and trading books is rare and applied only in 
extraordinary circumstances613; 
 
613  
Examples of extraordinary circumstances are major publicly announced events such as – 
(a) a restructuring of a Reporting Bank that results in the permanent closure of certain trading desks, and 
thus termination of a trading business activity applicable to an instrument or portfolio; or  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-10 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must complete an internal review determining that 
reassignment of the instrument is in accordance with the Reporting Bank’s 
policies for determining the assignment of instrument to the banking book 
or the trading book, obtain approval from the senior management of the 
Reporting Bank for the reassignment of the instrument, and document the 
internal review process and the approval of the senior management; 
 
(c) 
with the exception of an instrument that is reassigned from the banking 
book to the trading book arising from its reclassification as a trading asset 
or liability under the Accounting Standards, the Reporting Bank must 
obtain the prior approval from the Authority for the reassignment of the 
instrument. In applying for such approval from the Authority, the 
Reporting Bank must provide the Authority with the documentation 
required under sub-paragraph (b); 
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank must disclose the reassignment of the instrument 
under Part XI of this Notice; 
 
(e) 
the Reporting Bank must not revoke the reassignment of the instrument, 
unless such revocation is required by changes in the characteristics of the 
Reporting Bank’s position in the instrument. The Reporting Bank must 
obtain the prior approval of the Authority for the revocation. 
 
8.1.38 
A Reporting Bank must not reassign an instrument from the banking book to 
the trading book (or vice versa) with the intention of achieving lower capital requirements.  
 
8.1.39 
Where a Reporting Bank has reassigned an instrument from the banking book 
to the trading book (or vice versa), the Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
determine its total RWA for both the banking and trading books 
immediately before and immediately after the reassignment; and 
 
(b) 
if the Reporting Bank’s total RWA immediately after the reassignment is 
reduced compared to that immediately before the reassignment, ensure 
that the difference in the total RWA is included in market RWA as a Pillar 
1 RWA surcharge614, subject to paragraph 8.1.40.  
 
8.1.40 
The Reporting Bank may factor in a run-off of the Pillar 1 RWA surcharge 
referred to in paragraph 8.1.39(b) as the instruments contributing to the Pillar 1 RWA 
surcharge mature or expire, subject to prior written approval by the Authority and 
agreement with the Authority on the manner in which the run-off is calculated. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the instruments contributing to the Pillar 1 RWA 
surcharge, that have not matured or expired continue to be subject to the ongoing capital 
requirements of the book into which the instruments have been assigned. 
 
 
(b) a change in the Accounting Standards pertaining to the conditions under which an item may be fair-
valued through P&L. 
 
Market events, changes in the liquidity of an instrument, or a change in trading intent alone would not be 
considered as valid reasons for reassigning an instrument to a different book.  
614  
For operational simplicity, the Reporting Bank is not required to calculate the capital surcharge on an 
ongoing basis.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-11 
8.1.41 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the Pillar 1 RWA surcharge as specified in 
paragraph 8.1.39 as a result of reassigning instruments between the banking and trading 
books, regardless of whether the reassignment has been made at the discretion of the 
Reporting Bank or is beyond the Reporting Bank’s control615. 
 
8.1.42 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
specify, in its policies referred to paragraph 8.1.33 for determining the 
assignment of instruments to the banking book or the trading book – 
 
(i) 
that the Reporting Bank, after initially assigning an instrument to the 
banking book or the trading book, may only reassign the instrument, 
subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 8.1.36 to 8.1.42; 
 
 
(ii) 
a description of the circumstances or criteria where the Reporting 
Bank may consider reassigning an instrument from the banking book 
to the trading book (and vice versa); 
 
 
(iii) the process by which the Reporting Bank would obtain approval from 
the senior management of the Reporting Bank and from the 
Authority, in a case where the Reporting Bank seeks a reassignment 
of an instrument; 
 
 
(iv) how the Reporting Bank identifies an extraordinary circumstance for 
the purposes of paragraph 8.1.37(a); and 
 
(v) 
a requirement that any reassignment of an instrument be publicly 
disclosed annually; 
 
 
(b) 
review the policies referred to in sub-paragraph (a) and update them, at 
least annually616; 
 
 
 
(c) 
provide the policies referred to in sub-paragraph (a) to the Authority 
within 7 business days from the effective date, and where the Reporting 
Bank has made any updates to the policies mentioned in sub-paragraph 
(a), provide to the Authority such updated policies and the changes made 
within 7 business days; and   
 
(d)  have systems in place to manage the reassignment of instruments 
between the banking and trading books on an ongoing basis, after initial 
assignment.  
 
8.1.43 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must treat risk transfers done from the 
banking book to the trading book as internal risk transfers, in accordance with paragraphs 
8.1.45 to 8.1.59. The Reporting Bank must treat the reassignment of instruments between 
the trading and banking books in accordance with paragraphs 8.1.36 to 8.1.42. 
 
 
615  
For example, in the case of the delisting of an equity.  
616  
A Reporting Bank should update the policies based on an analysis of all reassignments performed during 
the previous year.  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-12 
Treatment of internal risk transfers from the trading book to the banking book  
 
8.1.44 
A Reporting Bank must not take into account any internal risk transfer from the 
trading book to the banking book when determining its regulatory capital requirements.   
 
 
Treatment of internal risk transfers of credit and equity risk from the banking 
book to the trading book 
 
8.1.45 
Where a Reporting Bank hedges a banking book credit exposure by purchasing 
a hedging instrument from an external party through its trading book and engaging in an 
internal risk transfer of the credit risk from the banking book to the trading book, the 
Reporting Bank may deem the credit exposure in the banking book to be hedged for capital 
requirements purposes only if –  
 
(a)  the hedging instrument purchased through the trading book is purchased 
from an external party which is an eligible protection provider;  
 
(b) 
there is an exact match between the hedging instrument and the internal 
risk transfer;  
 
(c)  subject to sub-paragraph (d), the hedging instrument meets the 
requirements specified in paragraphs 1.1, 2.7, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 of 
Annex 7H; and 
 
(d) 
in the case where the hedging instrument is a credit derivative which 
meets the requirements in sub-paragraph (c) other than paragraph 
5.3(f)(iii) of Annex 7H, the Reporting Bank recognises the credit protection 
provided by the hedging instrument in accordance with paragraph 1.3 of 
Annex 7I. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the cap 
of 60% on a credit derivative without a restructuring obligation specified 
in paragraph 1.3 of Annex 7I does not reduce the notional amount of the 
internal risk transfer, and only limits the recognition of credit risk 
mitigation from the hedging instrument and the internal risk transfer for 
the purposes of calculating credit risk capital requirements. 
 
8.1.46 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.1.45, a Reporting Bank may recognise a hedge 
that comprises multiple hedging instruments with multiple counterparties, subject to – 
 
(a) 
each hedging instrument meeting the requirements in paragraph 8.1.45(a) 
and (c), and where applicable, paragraph 8.1.45(d); and 
 
(b) 
there being an exact match between the aggregate hedge and the internal 
risk transfer. 
 
8.1.47 
Where a Reporting Bank hedges a banking book equity exposure by purchasing 
a hedging instrument from an external party through its trading book and engaging in an 
internal risk transfer of the equity risk from the banking book to the trading book, the 
Reporting Bank can consider the equity exposure in the banking book to be hedged for 
capital requirements purposes only if – 
 
(a)  the hedging instrument purchased through the trading book is purchased 
from an external party which is an eligible protection provider; 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-13 
 
(b) 
there is an exact match between the hedging instrument and the internal 
risk transfer;  
 
(c) 
subject to sub-paragraph (d), the hedging instrument meets the 
requirements specified in paragraphs 1.1, 2.7, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 of 
Annex 7H; and 
 
(d) 
in the case where the hedging instrument is a credit derivative which 
meets the requirements in sub-paragraph (c) other than paragraph 
5.3(f)(iii) of Annex 7H, the Reporting Bank recognises the credit protection 
provided by the hedging instrument, in accordance with paragraph 1.3 of 
Annex 7I. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the cap 
of 60% on a credit derivative without a restructuring obligation specified 
in paragraph 1.3 of Annex 7I does not reduce the notional amount of the 
internal risk transfer, and only limits the recognition of credit risk 
mitigation from the hedging instrument and the internal risk transfer for 
the purposes of calculating credit risk capital requirements. 
 
8.1.48 
Where the conditions specified in paragraphs 8.1.45 or 8.1.47 are fulfilled, a 
Reporting Bank may deem the banking book credit exposure or the banking book equity 
exposure, as the case may be, to be hedged by the banking book leg of the internal risk 
transfer for the purposes of calculating credit risk capital requirements. In such cases, the 
Reporting Bank must include both the trading book leg of the internal risk transfer and the 
external hedging instrument when calculating its market risk capital requirements. 
 
8.1.49 
Where the conditions specified in paragraphs 8.1.45 or 8.1.47, as the case may 
be, are not fulfilled, a Reporting Bank must not deem the banking book credit exposure or 
the banking book equity exposure, as the case may be, to be hedged by the banking book 
leg of the internal risk transfer for the purposes of calculating credit risk capital 
requirements. In such cases, the Reporting Bank must calculate market risk capital 
requirements for the external hedging instrument but not for the trading book leg of the 
internal risk transfer. 
 
8.1.50 
A Reporting Bank is subject to market risk capital requirements in respect of 
any short credit position or short equity position617 in the banking book which is created 
by an internal risk transfer. The Reporting Bank is not subject to credit risk capital 
requirements for such a short credit or short equity position in the banking book.   
 
 
Treatment of internal risk transfers of general interest rate risk from the 
banking book to the trading book 
    
8.1.51 
Where a Reporting Bank hedges a banking book interest rate risk exposure 
using an internal risk transfer with its trading book, the Reporting Bank may treat the 
trading book leg of the internal risk transfer under the market risk framework only if – 
 
 
617  
Such a short credit position or short equity position in the banking book can occur when the Reporting Bank 
enters into an internal risk transfer from the banking book to the trading book that over-hedges its banking 
book credit exposure or banking book equity exposure.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-14 
(a)  the Reporting Bank documents the internal risk transfer with respect to 
the banking book interest rate risk being hedged and the sources of such 
risk; 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank conducts the internal risk transfer with a dedicated 
internal risk transfer trading desk which has been specifically approved by 
the Authority for this purpose; and  
 
(c)  the Reporting Bank calculates market risk capital requirements for the 
internal risk transfer under the dedicated internal risk transfer trading 
desk mentioned in sub-paragraph (b), and the market risk capital 
requirements for the dedicated internal risk transfer trading desk are 
determined with no recognition of diversification or hedging effects with 
any position outside the dedicated internal risk transfer trading desk. 
 
8.1.52 
A Reporting Bank must treat an internal risk transfer trading desk referred to 
in paragraph 8.1.51(b) as a notional trading desk where – 
 
(a)  the internal risk transfer trading desk need not have any traders or trading 
accounts assigned to it; and 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank need not ensure that the internal risk transfer trading 
desk meets the trading desk requirements set out in paragraph 8.1.65. 
 
8.1.53 
Where a Reporting Bank intends to use the IMA to calculate market risk capital 
requirements for the internal risk transfer trading desk referred to in paragraph 8.1.51(b), 
the Reporting Bank must apply to the Authority for prior written approval to use the IMA 
to calculate market risk capital requirements for the internal risk transfer trading desk.  
For the purposes of obtaining such approval, the Reporting Bank is only required to ensure 
that the internal risk transfer trading desk meets the quantitative trading desk 
requirements specified in paragraphs 8.3.17(b) and (c).  
 
8.1.54 
A Reporting Bank must not assign any positions to the internal risk transfer 
trading desk referred to in paragraph 8.1.51(b) other than – 
 
(a) 
internal risk transfers of interest rate risk from the banking book to the 
trading book; and 
 
(b) 
external hedges that meet the conditions specified in paragraph 8.1.56. 
 
8.1.55 
Where a Reporting Bank enters into an internal risk transfer that fulfils the 
requirements in paragraph 8.1.51, the Reporting Bank must include the banking book leg 
of the internal risk transfer in its measure of interest rate risk in the banking book in 
accordance with Section 5 of Annex 10A. 
 
8.1.56 
A Reporting Bank may include in the internal risk transfer trading desk referred 
to in paragraph 8.1.51(b), an instrument purchased from an external party that is –    
 
(a)  purchased by the internal risk transfer trading desk directly from the 
external party; or   
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-15 
(b)  obtained by the internal risk transfer trading desk, through another 
trading desk of the Reporting Bank acting as an agent, only where such 
internal risk transfer exactly matches the instrument purchased from the 
external party. In such a case, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the 
respective legs of the internal risk transfer are included in the internal risk 
transfer desk and the other trading desk. 
 
 
Treatment of internal risk transfers for market risk within the scope of 
application of the market risk capital requirement 
 
8.1.57 
Subject to paragraph 8.1.58, a Reporting Bank may recognise internal risk 
transfers between trading desks for market risk within the scope of application of the 
market risk capital requirements (including FX risk and commodities risk in the banking 
book), when calculating its market risk capital requirements, by including the respective 
legs of the internal risk transfer in the respective trading desks.  
 
8.1.58 
A Reporting Bank may recognise internal risk transfers between the internal 
risk transfer desk and other trading desks when calculating its market risk capital 
requirements only if the requirements specified in paragraphs 8.1.51 to 8.1.56 are fulfilled. 
 
8.1.59 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the trading book leg of any internal risk 
transfers complies with the requirements in this Sub-division, no differently from 
instruments in the trading book transacted with external counterparties. 
 
 
Treatment of eligible hedges for the CVA risk capital treatment 
 
8.1.60 
For the treatment of eligible CVA hedges, a Reporting Bank must ensure that it 
complies with the requirements specified in paragraphs 8.5.5 and 8.5.6. 
 
8.1.61 
A Reporting Bank may use internal risk transfers between the CVA portfolio and 
the market risk portfolio under the trading book to hedge the counterparty credit risk 
exposure of a derivative instrument in the trading or banking book, as long as the 
requirements specified in paragraph 8.1.45 are met. 
 
 
Sub-division 6: Definition of Trading Desk and Trading Desk Structure 
 
8.1.62 
For the purposes of the calculation of market risk capital requirements – 
 
(a) 
a trading desk is a group of traders or trading accounts defined by a 
Reporting Bank that implements a defined business strategy for 
managing market risk, and operates within a risk management structure; 
and 
 
(b) 
a trading desk structure is the manner of organisation of all trading desks 
on which a Reporting Bank holds market risk positions, including the 
allocation of the Reporting Bank’s market risk positions to each trading 
desk. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-16 
8.1.63 
A Reporting Bank using the IMA must obtain the written approval of the 
Authority for its trading desk structure, prior to basing the calculation of its market risk 
capital requirements for IMA on its trading desk structure. For the purposes of obtaining 
such approval, the Reporting Bank must submit to the Authority – 
 
(a) 
a proposal of its trading desk structure which sets out a definition of each 
trading desk, such that – 
 
(i) 
the definition of each trading desk is sufficiently granular, based on 
the size of the Reporting Bank’s overall trading operations; and 
 
 
(ii) 
each trading desk meets the requirements in paragraph 8.1.65; and 
 
 
 
(b) 
for each trading desk that the Reporting Bank defines under its trading 
desk structure, a policy document which clearly documents how the 
trading desk meets the requirements in paragraph 8.1.65. 
 
 
8.1.64 
Where a Reporting Bank has obtained the approval of the Authority for its 
trading desk structure, the Reporting Bank may define operational sub-desks within one 
or more of its approved trading desks without the need for approval from the Authority. 
The Reporting Bank may use such operational sub-desks only for the Reporting Bank’s 
internal operational purposes, and must not use such operational sub-desks for the 
purposes of the calculation of market risk capital requirements. 
 
8.1.65 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.1.63, a Reporting Bank using the IMA must 
ensure that all of the following requirements are met by every trading desk defined by the 
Reporting Bank under its trading desk structure on an ongoing basis618: 
 
(a) 
the trading desk must be a clearly defined group of traders or trading 
accounts, where a trading account is an indisputable and clearly defined 
unit of observation in accounting for trading activity; 
 
(b) 
the trading desk must have one head trader who has direct oversight of 
the group of traders or trading accounts. As an exception, the trading 
desk may have 2 head traders if – 
 
(i) 
the roles, responsibilities and authorities of the 2 head traders are 
clearly separated; or 
 
(ii) 
one head trader has oversight over the other head trader; 
 
 
(c) 
each trader or trading account, assigned to the trading desk must have 
one or more dedicated functions; 
 
 
(d) 
a trading account must be assigned to only one trading desk, and each 
trading desk must have a clearly defined risk scope that includes 
specification of the trading desk’s overall risk class and permitted risk 
factors. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the risk scope of the trading 
 
618  
A Reporting Bank that only uses the SA(MR) should consider the relevance of these requirements in 
reviewing its trading desk structure. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-17 
desk is consistent with its pre-established strategy referred to in 
paragraph 8.1.62(a); 
 
(e) 
a trader, including a head trader, must not be assigned to more than one 
trading desk; 
 
(f)  
the trading desk must have a clear reporting line to the senior

(ii) 
a clear description of the business strategy for the trading desk, 
including – 
 
(A) 
what the business strategy involves620;  
 
(B) 
the extent to which trading activities are related to the 
Reporting Bank’s customers; and 
 
(C) 
whether the trading activities of the desk include trade 
origination and structuring, execution services, or both; 
 
(iii) a clear description of the activities of the trading desk, including – 
 
(A) 
a complete list of instruments that the trading desk is 
permitted to trade in; and 
 
(B) 
the instruments that the trading desk is expected to trade in 
most frequently; and 
 
(iv) a clear description of the trading and hedging strategies of the 
trading desk, including – 
 
(A) 
the means by which the positions taken by the trading desk 
are to be hedged, and the slippages and mismatches of 
hedges that the Reporting Bank would expect; and 
 
(B) 
the expected holding period of positions taken by the trading 
desk; 
 
(h) 
the trading desk must produce regular management information reports, 
which clearly state the revenue, costs and RWA attributable to the trading 
desk; 
 
 
619  
The trading desk should have a clear and formal compensation policy which is clearly linked to the pre-
established strategy of the trading desk referred to in paragraph 8.1.62(a).  
620  
For example, whether the strategy involves trading on the shape of a yield curve. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-18 
(i) 
the trading desk must have a clear risk management structure, which 
includes – 
 
(i) 
clear identification of the groups and personnel responsible for 
overseeing the risk-taking activities at the trading desk; and 
 
(ii) 
clearly defined trading limits, which are based on the business 
strategy of the trading desk, and which are reviewed at least 
annually by the senior management of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(j) 
the Reporting Bank must –  
 
(i) 
set trading limits at the trading desk level that are based on 
appropriate market risk metrics621, and minimally set notional limits; 
and 
 
(ii) 
set trader mandates for each trader assigned to the trading desk; 
 
(k)  the trading desk must produce risk management reports at least weekly, 
which must include at a minimum – 
 
(i) 
profit and loss reports, which are periodically reviewed, validated 
and modified (if necessary) by the product control function of the 
Reporting Bank; and 
 
(ii) 
internal and regulatory risk measure reports, including reports on 
trading desk VaR and ES, trading desk VaR sensitivities and ES 
sensitivities to risk factors, backtesting and the p-values of the risk 
measures. 
 
8.1.66 
For each trading desk defined by a Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank must 
prepare, evaluate, and provide to the Authority upon request, all of the following: 
 
(a) 
inventory ageing reports; 
 
(b) 
daily limit reports, which have information on exposures, limit breaches, 
and follow-up actions taken to address limit breaches; 
 
(c) 
where the Reporting Bank has active intraday trading, reports on intraday 
limits, and respective utilisation and breaches; 
 
(d) 
reports on the assessment of market liquidity. 
 
8.1.67 
A Reporting Bank using the IMA must treat FX risk and commodities risk for 
instruments in the banking book as if they were held on one or more notional trading desks 
within the trading book, where – 
 
(a) 
the notional trading desk need not have any traders or trading accounts 
assigned to it; and 
 
 
621  
For example, sensitivity of credit spread risk or jump-to-default risk for a credit trading desk. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-19 
(b) 
a Reporting Bank need not ensure that the notional trading desk meets 
the trading desk requirements set out in paragraph 8.1.65. 
 
8.1.68 
Where a Reporting Bank intends to use the IMA to calculate market risk capital 
requirements for a notional trading desk referred to in paragraph 8.1.67, the Reporting 
Bank must take either or both of the following actions: 
 
(a) 
use an internal risk transfer to transfer all or part of the FX risk or 
commodities risk arising from the notional trading desk to another trading 
desk for which the Reporting Bank has received approval from the 
Authority to use the IMA to calculate market risk capital requirements; 
 
(b) 
apply to the Authority for approval to use the IMA to calculate market 
risk capital requirements for the notional trading desk. For the purposes 
of obtaining such approval, the Reporting Bank is only required to ensure 
that the notional trading desk meets the quantitative trading desk 
requirements specified in paragraphs 8.3.17(b) and (c). 
 
8.1.69 
Despite paragraph 8.1.65(e), a Reporting Bank may do either or both of the 
following:  
 
(a) 
assign a trader622 ownership and responsibilities in both trading book and 
banking book portfolios;   
 
(b)  assign a trader to more than one trading desk where the Reporting Bank 
is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority upon request, 
that such an assignment was performed on the basis of sound 
management, business or resource allocation reasons. The Reporting 
Bank must not make such an assignment with the sole intention of 
avoiding any requirements which are specified in this Part623. 
 
622  
For example, global treasury desk heads or department heads. 
623  
For example, a Reporting Bank must not make the assignment with the intention of optimising the likelihood 
of success in the backtesting and PLA tests.

Division 2: SA(MR) 
 
Sub-division 1: General Requirements 
 
8.2.1 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the market risk capital requirements under the 
SA(MR), for positions for which the Reporting Bank is using the SA(MR), as the sum of the 
following 3 components:  
 
(a) 
the sensitivities-based method (SBM) capital requirement in accordance 
with Sub-divisions 2 to 8 of this Division;  
 
(b) 
the default risk capital (DRC) requirement in accordance with Sub-division 
9 of this Division;  
 
(c) 
the capital requirement for residual risk add-on (RRAO) in accordance with 
Sub-division 10 of this Division.  
 
 
Sub-division 2: SBM - Calculation of Capital Requirement 
 
 
Instruments subject to delta, vega and curvature risks 
 
8.2.2 
Subject to paragraph 8.2.3, a Reporting Bank must calculate capital 
requirements for delta risk for all instruments within the scope of Sub-division 2 of Division 
1 of this Part.  
 
8.2.3  
A Reporting Bank must not calculate capital requirements for delta risk for an 
instrument with an exotic underlying as defined in Sub-division 10 of this Division, where 
the value of the instrument at any point of time is solely driven by an exotic underlying.  
 
8.2.4 
A Reporting Bank must subject the following instruments to capital 
requirements for vega risk and curvature risk – 
 
(a)  any instrument with optionality624; 
 
(b)  any instrument with an embedded prepayment option; and   
 
(c)  any instrument whose cashflow cannot be written as a linear function of 
the underlying notional625.     
 
8.2.5 
For the purposes of this Part, an instrument with an embedded prepayment 
option is an instrument which grants the debtor the right to repay part of, or the entire, 
principal amount before the contractual maturity of the instrument, without having to 
compensate for any foregone interest.  
 
624  
For example, an instrument that is an option or that includes an option (e.g. an embedded option such as 
convertibility or rate dependent prepayment), including calls, puts, caps, floors, swaptions, barrier options 
and exotic options.  
625  
For example, plain-vanilla options or constant maturity swaps. The cash flows generated by a plain-vanilla 
option cannot be written as a linear function because they are the maximum of the spot and the strike. 
Instruments whose cash flows can be written as a linear function of underlying notional are instruments 
without optionality (e.g. cash flows generated by a coupon bearing bond can be written as a linear function) 
and are not subject to capital requirements for vega risk nor capital requirements for curvature risk.

8.2.6 
A Reporting Bank must subject an instrument with an embedded prepayment 
option626 to capital requirements for vega risk and curvature risk for the GIRR, CSR (non-
securitisation) and CSR (securitisation: non-CTP) risk classes. 
 
8.2.7 
A Reporting Bank may calculate capital requirements for curvature risk for all 
instruments subject to capital requirements for delta risk, but are not included in the scope 
of paragraph 8.2.4627, provided that the Reporting Bank calculates capital requirements 
for curvature risk for all instruments subject to capital requirements for delta risk under 
the SBM unless a change in treatment is approved by the Authority.  
 
 
 
Process to calculate the SBM capital requirement  
  
8.2.8 
To calculate the SBM capital requirement, a Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a)  for each risk class, specify risk factors for delta, vega and curvature risks 
in accordance with paragraphs 8.2.15 to 8.2.54 and paragraphs 8.2.80 to 
8.2.90; 
 
(b)  for each risk class, calculate the delta risk capital requirement in 
accordance with paragraph 8.2.10; 
 
(c) 
for each risk class, calculate the vega risk capital requirement in 
accordance with paragraph 8.2.11;  
 
(d)  for each risk class, calculate the curvature risk capital requirement in 
accordance with paragraph 8.2.12; 
 
(e)  perform the calculations set out in sub-paragraphs (b) to (d) using 
adjusted correlation parameters for 2 additional correlation scenarios in 
accordance with paragraph 8.2.14(b) and (c); and  
 
(f) 
calculate the SBM capital requirement by – 
 
(i) 
for each of the 3 correlation scenarios set out in paragraph 8.2.14(a) 
to (c), calculating the sum of the delta risk, vega risk and curvature 
risk capital requirements, for all risk classes to obtain the aggregate 
capital requirement for that correlation scenario; and  
 
(ii) 
taking the largest aggregate capital requirement from the 3 
correlation scenarios as the SBM capital requirement.  
 
8.2.9 
A Reporting Bank must not apply a floor to the risk weights referred to in 
paragraphs 8.2.10(d), 8.2.11(d), and 8.2.12(b) when calculating the capital requirements 
 
626  
A Reporting Bank must subject instruments with embedded prepayment options, including securitisation 
exposures where the assets underlying the securitisation have embedded prepayment options, to RRAO in 
accordance with Sub-division 10 of this Division, if the embedded prepayment option is a behavioural option.  
627  
For example, where a Reporting Bank manages the non-linear risk of instruments with optionality and other 
instruments holistically, the Reporting Bank may choose to include instruments without optionality in the 
calculation of capital requirements for curvature risk. The Reporting Bank is not required to restrict the 
instruments for which it calculates capital requirements for curvature risk to the instruments set out in 
paragraph 8.2.4.

for delta, vega and curvature risks for the GIRR, CSR (non-securitisation), CSR 
(securitisation: non-CTP) and CSR (securitisation: CTP) risk classes. 
 
 
Capital requirement for delta risk for each risk class 
 
8.2.10 
For each risk class, a Reporting Bank must calculate the delta risk capital 
requirement using the steps as follows: 
 
(a)  step 1: for each position in an instrument sensitive to a risk factor specified 
for that risk class in paragraphs 8.2.15 to 8.2.54 and paragraphs 8.2.80 
to 8.2.90, calculate a sensitivity to the risk factor in accordance with 
paragraphs 8.2.55 to 8.2.89;  
 
(b)  step 2: for each risk factor k, calculate a net sensitivity sk for all positions 
in instruments sensitive to the risk factor, by offsetting all sensitivities of 
opposite direction to the same risk factor, irrespective of the instruments 
from which the sensitivities are derived628; 
 
(c) 
step 3: assign the net sensitivity sk for each risk factor k into a delta risk 
bucket in accordance with paragraphs 8.2.91 to 8.2.141;  
 
(d)  step 4: calculate the delta risk weighted sensitivity for each risk factor k, 
WSk, by multiplying the net sensitivity sk and the corresponding risk weight 
RWk specified in paragraphs 8.2.91 to 8.2.141: 
 
𝑾𝑺𝒌= 𝑹𝑾𝒌𝒔𝒌 
 
(e)  step 5 (aggregation within buckets): calculate the risk position for delta 
risk bucket b, Kb by aggregating the weighted sensitivities to risk factors 
within the same delta risk bucket. Subject to paragraphs 8.2.110, 8.2.117, 
8.2.124 and 8.2.132, a Reporting Bank must aggregate the weighted 
sensitivities to risk factors within the same delta risk bucket by using the 
corresponding delta risk correlation parameter 𝛒𝐤𝐥, specified in paragraphs 
8.2.91 to 8.2.141, and the following formula: 
 
𝑲𝒃= √𝐦𝐚𝐱⁡(𝟎, ∑𝑾𝑺𝒌
𝟐
𝒌
+ ∑∑𝝆𝒌𝒍𝑾𝑺𝒌𝑾𝑺𝒍
𝒌≠𝒍
𝒌
) 
 
 
(f)  step 6 (aggregation across buckets): calculate the delta risk capital 
requirement by aggregating the risk positions for all the delta risk buckets 
within each risk class. Subject to paragraph 8.2.125(b) and sub-paragraph 
(g), a Reporting Bank must calculate the delta risk capital requirement by 
aggregating the risk positions for all the delta risk buckets within each risk 
class by using the prescribed correlation 𝜸𝒃𝒄, specified in paragraphs 
8.2.91 to 8.2.141, for the risk class and the following formula: 
  
 
628  
For example, if the Reporting Bank’s portfolio is made of 2 interest rate swaps on 3-month Euribor with the 
same fixed rate and same notional amount but of opposite direction, the GIRR on that portfolio would be 
zero.

Capital requirement for vega risk for each risk class 
 
8.2.11 
 For each risk class, a Reporting Bank must calculate the vega risk capital 
requirement using the steps as follows:  
 
(a)  step 1: for each position in an instrument sensitive to a risk factor specified 
for that risk class in paragraphs 8.2.15 to 8.2.54 and paragraphs 8.2.80 
to 8.2.90, calculate a sensitivity to the risk factor in accordance with 
paragraphs 8.2.55 to 8.2.90;  
 
(b) 
step 2: for each risk factor k, calculate a net sensitivity sk for all positions 
in instruments sensitive to the risk factor by offsetting all sensitivities of 
opposite direction to the same risk factor, irrespective of the instruments 
from which the sensitivities are derived629;  
 
(c) 
step 3: assign the net sensitivity sk for each risk factor k into a vega risk 
bucket in accordance with paragraphs 8.2.142 and 8.2.143;  
 
(d)  step 4: calculate the weighted sensitivity for each risk factor k, WSk, by 
multiplying the net sensitivity sk and the corresponding risk weight RWk as 
defined in paragraph 8.2.144: 
 
629  
For example, if the Reporting Bank’s portfolio is made of 2 interest rate swaps on 3-month Euribor with the 
same fixed rate and same notional amount but of opposite direction, the GIRR on that portfolio would be 
zero.

Capital requirement for curvature risk for each risk class 
 
8.2.12 
For each risk class, a Reporting Bank must calculate the curvature risk capital 
requirement using the steps as follows: 
 
(a)  step 1: for each position in an instrument sensitive to a curvature risk 
factor k specified for that risk class in paragraphs 8.2.15 to 8.2.54 and 
paragraphs 8.2.80 to 8.2.89, subject the curvature risk factor k to an 
upward shock and a downward shock of a magnitude equal to the risk 
weight for the curvature risk factor k ( 𝑹𝑾𝒌
𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆) , determined in 
accordance with paragraphs 8.2.151 and 8.2.153630;  
 
(b)  step 2: for each risk factor k, subject to paragraph 8.2.152, calculate the 
net curvature risk position after applying an upward shock, 𝑪𝑽𝑹𝒌
+, and the 
net curvature risk position after applying a downward shock, 𝑪𝑽𝑹𝒌
−, by 
using the following formulas: 
 
𝑪𝑽𝑹𝒌
+ = −∑{𝑽𝒊(𝑿𝒌
𝑹𝑾(𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆)+) −𝑽𝒊(𝑿𝒌) −𝑹𝑾𝒌
𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆× 𝒔𝒊𝒌}
𝒊
 
 
𝑪𝑽𝑹𝒌
−= −∑{𝑽𝒊(𝑿𝒌
𝑹𝑾(𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆)−) −𝑽𝒊(𝑿𝒌) + 𝑹𝑾𝒌
𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆× 𝒔𝒊𝒌}
𝒊
 
 
  
where –  
 
(i)  
i is an instrument subject to curvature risks associated with 
curvature risk factor k; 
 
(ii)  𝑿𝒌 is the current level of risk factor k; 
 
(iii)  𝑽𝒊(𝑿𝒌) is the price of instrument i at the current level of risk factor k; 
 
(iv)  𝑽𝒊(𝑿𝒌
𝑹𝑾(𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆)+) and 𝑽𝒊(𝑿𝒌
𝑹𝑾(𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆)−) is the price of instrument i 
after 𝑿𝒌 is shocked upward and downward, respectively; 
 
(v)  𝑹𝑾𝒌
𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆 is the risk weight for curvature risk factor k for instrument 
i, determined in accordance with paragraphs 8.2.151 and 8.2.153; 
and 
 
(vi)  𝒔𝒊𝒌  is calculated in accordance with paragraphs 8.2.74, 8.2.78 and 
8.2.79 and is –  
 
 
(A) for the FX and equity risk classes, the delta sensitivity of 
instrument i to the delta risk factor that corresponds to 
curvature risk factor k;  
 
 
 
630  
For example, for GIRR, a Reporting Bank must shift all tenors of all risk-free yields for all risk-free interest 
rate yield curves for a given currency (e.g. the 3-month Euribor, 6-month Euribor or 1-year Euribor etc for 
the Euro) upward and downward by a magnitude determined in accordance with paragraph 8.2.153.

(viii) ⁡𝑽𝒊(𝑿𝒌
𝑹𝑾(𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆)−) −𝑽𝒊(𝑿𝒌) + 𝑹𝑾𝒌
𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆× 𝒔𝒊𝒌 is the curvature risk 
position of instrument i after 𝑿𝒌 is shocked downward.  
 
(c) 
step 3: assign the net curvature risk position after applying an upward 
shock, 𝑪𝑽𝑹𝒌
+ , and the net curvature risk position after applying a 
downward shock, 𝑪𝑽𝑹𝒌
−, for each curvature risk factor k into a curvature 
risk bucket in accordance with paragraph 8.2.150;  
 
(d)  step 4 (aggregation within buckets): calculate the risk position for 
curvature risk bucket b, Kb, by aggregating the curvature risk positions 
within each curvature risk bucket. Subject to paragraph 8.2.156, a 
Reporting Bank must aggregate the curvature risk positions in each 
curvature risk bucket by using the corresponding curvature risk correlation, 
𝝆𝒌𝒍 , determined in accordance with paragraphs 8.2.154 to 8.2.155, and 
the following formulas:

For the purposes of paragraph 8.2.12, if the price of an instrument depends on 
several curvature risk factors, a Reporting Bank must calculate the curvature risk position 
arising from that instrument separately for each curvature risk factor. 
 
 
 
Correlation scenarios  
 
8.2.14 
A Reporting Bank must perform the calculation of the delta risk capital 
requirement in accordance with paragraph 8.2.10, the calculation of the vega risk capital 
requirement in accordance with paragraph 8.2.11 and the calculation of the curvature risk 
capital requirement in accordance with paragraph 8.2.12 for 3 different scenarios using 
the following specified values for the correlation parameter 𝝆𝒌𝒍 (correlation between risk 
factors within a risk bucket) and 𝜸𝒃𝒄 (correlation across risk buckets within a risk class)632:  
 
(a)  under the “medium correlations” scenario, apply the correlation 
parameters 𝝆𝒌𝒍 and 𝜸𝒃𝒄, specified in paragraphs 8.2.91 to 8.2.157;  
 
(b)  under the “high correlations” scenario, apply the correlation parameters 
𝝆𝒌𝒍
𝒉𝒊𝒈𝒉 and 𝜸𝒃𝒄
𝒉𝒊𝒈𝒉, calculated by multiplying  𝝆𝒌𝒍 and 𝜸𝒃𝒄, specified in 
paragraphs 8.2.91 to 8.2.157 by 1.25, subject to a cap at 100%;  
 
(c)  under the “low correlations” scenario, apply the correlation parameters 
𝝆𝒌𝒍
𝒍𝒐𝒘  and 𝜸𝒃𝒄
𝒍𝒐𝒘 , calculated as follows (where  𝝆𝒌𝒍 and 𝜸𝒃𝒄 are as specified in

Sub-division 3: SBM – Risk Factor Definitions 
 
8.2.15 
If a risk factor is defined based on tenor, a Reporting Bank must define the risk 
factor based only on the tenors specified in this Sub-division633. 
 
 
 
Risk factors for GIRR risk class  
 
8.2.16 
A Reporting Bank must specify the following GIRR delta risk factors for each 
currency referenced by interest rate-sensitive instruments: 
 
(a)  the risk-free yield for each risk-free yield curve for each of the following 
tenors: 0.25 years, 0.5 years, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 
15 years, 20 years and 30 years;   
 
(b) 
the inflation rate for each flat curve of the market-implied inflation rate 
across all tenors. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must not recognise 
the term structure of the inflation rate curve in specifying risk factors;  
 
(c)  the cross-currency basis634 over either USD or EUR, for each flat curve of 
the cross-currency basis over either USD or EUR, respectively, across all 
tenors. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must not recognise the term 
structure of the cross-currency basis curve in specifying risk factors. 
 
8.2.17 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.2.16(a), a Reporting Bank must construct the 
risk-free yield curves for each currency using –  
 
(a)  money market instruments held in the trading book that have the lowest 
credit risk635; or 
 
(b)  one or more market-implied swap curves used by the Reporting Bank to 
mark positions to market636. 
 
8.2.18 
Where there is insufficient data to construct the risk-free yield curves referred 
to in paragraph 8.2.17, a Reporting Bank must derive the risk-free yield curve from the 
sovereign bond yield curve for a given currency. In the case where the risk-free yield curve 
is derived from the sovereign bond yield curve for a given currency, the Reporting Bank 
must ensure that –  
 
 
633  
The Reporting Bank should assign GIRR, CSR, equity, commodity and FX risk factors to the specified tenors 
by linear interpolation or a method that is used by the risk control function of the Reporting Bank to report 
market risks or P&L to senior management.  
634  
Cross-currency basis is a basis added to a yield curve in order to price a swap for which the 2 legs are paid 
in 2 different currencies. Cross-currency bases are used by market participants to price cross-currency 
interest rate swaps paying a fixed or floating leg in one currency, receiving a fixed or floating leg in a 
second currency, and including an exchange of the notional in the 2 currencies at the start date and at the 
end date of the swap.  
635  
For example, overnight index swaps or bond repurchase agreements.  
636  
For example, interbank offered rate swap curves.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-29 
(a)  it calculates the delta risk capital requirement under the CSR (non-
securitisation) risk class for the interest rate-sensitive instruments using 
the sensitivity to the credit spread of the sovereign bond; or   
 
(b)  in cases where the Reporting Bank cannot meet the requirement in sub-
paragraph (a) as it cannot perform the decomposition of a sovereign bond 
yield curve risk factor into a GIRR delta risk factor and CSR (non-
securitisation) delta risk factor as set out in the formula y=r+cs, where y 
is the sovereign bond yield curve risk factor, r is the GIRR delta risk factor 
and cs is the CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk factor, the Reporting Bank 
must assign the sensitivity to risk factor y to both the GIRR and CSR (non-
securitisation) risk classes.   
 
8.2.19 
For the purposes of constructing the risk-free yield curves for each currency in 
accordance with paragraph 8.2.17, a Reporting Bank must treat the curves within each of 
the following pairs as 2 different curves: 
 
(a)  an overnight index swap curve637 and an interbank offered rate swap 
curve638; 
 
(b)  2 interbank offered rate curves at different maturities639; 
 
(c)  onshore and offshore currency curves640. 
 
8.2.20 
A Reporting Bank must include the inflation rate referred to in paragraph 
8.2.16(b) as a risk factor for an instrument whose cash flow is dependent on a measure 
of inflation641. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the GIRR delta risk 
factor referred to in paragraph 8.2.16(a) and where relevant, the GIRR delta risk factor 
referred to in paragraph 8.2.16(c), are included as risk factors for the instrument.  
 
8.2.21 
For an instrument with cross-currency basis risk, a Reporting Bank must include 
the cross-currency basis over either USD or EUR as a risk factor642. To avoid doubt, the 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the GIRR delta risk factor referred to in paragraph 
8.2.16(a) and where relevant, the GIRR delta risk factor referred to in paragraph 8.2.16(b), 
are included as risk factors for the instrument. 
 
8.2.22 
For an instrument that has cross-currency basis risk and does not reference 
USD or EUR, a Reporting Bank must specify its GIRR delta risk factor for cross-currency 
basis risk as either the cross-currency basis over USD or the cross-currency basis over 
EUR, but not both. 
 
8.2.23 
A Reporting Bank must specify GIRR vega risk factors, for each currency 
referenced by interest rate-sensitive instruments with vega risks, as the implied volatilities 
 
637  
For example, Eonia or a new benchmark rate. 
638  
For example, 3-month Euribor or other benchmark rates.

For example, 3-month Euribor and 6-month Euribor. 
640  
For example, the onshore Indian rupee curve and the offshore Indian rupee curves.  
641  
For example, an instrument where the notional amount or interest payment is dependent on a consumer 
price index. 
642  
For example, a Reporting Bank trading a JPY/USD cross-currency basis swap would have JPY/USD cross-
currency basis risk exposure and should specify JPY/USD, which is cross-currency basis over USD, as a 
cross-currency basis risk factor for the instrument.

the time to maturity of each option. The Reporting Bank must map the implied volatility 
of each option to the following maturity tenors: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 
years. 
 
8.2.26 
In the case where the risk-free yield curve is derived from the sovereign bond 
yield curve for a given currency in accordance with paragraph 8.2.18, the Reporting Bank 
must assign the sensitivity to the implied volatility of options that reference the sovereign 
bond issuer to both the GIRR and CSR (non-securitisation) risk classes for vega risk factors. 
 
8.2.27 
A Reporting Bank must specify GIRR curvature risk factors as all the risk-free 
yield curves for each currency referenced by interest rate-sensitive instruments with 
curvature risks. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must not recognise the term structure 
of the risk-free yield curves in specifying risk factors and must treat risk-free yield curves 
in the same currency as the same curvature risk factor. 
   
8.2.28 
In the case where the risk-free yield curve is derived from the sovereign bond 
yield curve for a given currency in accordance with paragraph 8.2.18, a Reporting Bank 
must assign the sensitivity to the credit spread of the sovereign bond issuer to both the 
GIRR and CSR (non-securitisation) risk classes for curvature risk factors.

For example, an option with a forward starting cap, lasting 12 months, consisting of 4 consecutive caplets 
on USD 3-month Libor has 4 independent options, with option maturity dates in 12, 15, 18 and 21 months.  
Each of these options has USD 3-month Libor as the underlying, and the underlying matures 3 months 
after the option maturity date (in other words, the residual maturity of the underlying at the maturity date 
of each option is 3 months). Therefore, a Reporting Bank must specify the implied volatilities for such a 
forward starting cap, which would start in one year and last for 12 months along the following 2 dimensions: 
(i)  the time to maturity of the option’s individual components (caplets) – 12, 15, 18 and 21 months; and 
(ii) the residual maturity of the underlying of the option – 3 months.

Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-33 
To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must not recognise the term structure of the credit 
spread curve for each issuer name in specifying risk factors. 
 
 
 
Risk factors for equity risk class 
 
8.2.39 
A Reporting Bank must specify the equity delta risk factors for instruments with 
equity delta risk as –  
 
(a)  equity spot prices; and 
 
(b)  equity repo rates.  
 
8.2.40 
A Reporting Bank must specify equity vega risk factors for instruments with 
equity vega risks as the implied volatilities of options that reference the equity spot prices 
as underlyings, further specified based on the time to maturity of each option. The 
Reporting Bank must map the implied volatility of each option to the following maturity 
tenors: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years. The Reporting Bank must not

Risk factors for commodity risk class  
 
8.2.42 
A Reporting Bank must specify commodity delta risk factors for instruments 
with commodity delta risks as commodity spot prices, further specified based on the 
following 2 dimensions:  
 
(a)  delivery location of each commodity as specified in the contract governing 
the instrument644;

years, 0.25 years, 0.5 years, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 
15 years, 20 years and 30 years645. 
 
8.2.43 
Despite paragraph 8.2.42, the Reporting Bank may specify commodity delta 
risk factors as commodity forward prices for commodities646 further specified based on the 
2 dimensions set out in paragraph 8.2.42(a) and (b), where transactions in instruments 
relating to such commodities based on forward prices are more frequent than transactions 
based on spot prices. 
 
644  
For example, a Reporting Bank must consider an instrument governed by a contract that states that a 
commodity underlying the instrument can be delivered in 5 ports as having the same delivery location as 
another instrument governed by a contract that states that the same commodity underlying that other 
instrument can be delivered in the same 5 ports. The Reporting Bank must not consider an instrument 
governed by a contract that states that a commodity underlying the instrument can be delivered in 5 ports 
as having the same delivery location as another instrument governed by a contract  that states that the 
same commodity underlying that other instrument can be delivered in only 4 or less of those 5 ports.  
645  
For example, for commodities futures or forward contracts, a Reporting Bank must specify the commodity 
delta risk factors based on the tenors of the contracts.  
646  
For example, electricity which falls within delta risk bucket 3 for energy – electricity and carbon trading.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-34 
 
8.2.44 
For the purposes of specifying commodity delta risk factors under paragraphs

and commodity forward contracts.   
 
8.2.45 
A Reporting Bank must specify commodity vega risk factors for instruments 
with commodity vega risks, as the implied volatilities of options that reference commodity 
spot prices as underlyings, further specified based on the time to maturity of each option. 
The Reporting Bank must map the implied volatility of each option to the following maturity 
tenors: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years. To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank 
need not differentiate underlying commodity spot prices by the time to maturity of the 
underlying commodity or the delivery location of the underlying commodity. 
 
8.2.46 
A Reporting Bank must specify commodity curvature risk factors for instruments 
with commodity curvature risks as commodity spot prices. To avoid doubt, the Reporting 
Bank must not recognise the term structure of the commodities curve in specifying risk 
factors.  
 
8.2.47 
For the purposes of specifying delta, vega and curvature risk factors in 
accordance with paragraphs 8.2.42 to 8.2.46 for instruments with a commodity spread as 
their underlying, a Reporting Bank must specify the risk factors with respect to the 2 
commodities on which the commodity spread is based647.  
 
 
 
Risk factors for FX risk class 
 
8.2.48 
A Reporting Bank must specify FX delta risk factors for instruments with FX 
delta risks as the exchange rates between the currency in which each instrument is 
denominated and the reporting currency of the Reporting Bank. For an instrument that 
references an exchange rate between a pair of currencies which are both not the Reporting 
Bank’s reporting currency, the Reporting Bank must specify the FX delta risk factors as 
the exchange rates between the reporting currency of the Reporting Bank, the currencies 
in which the instrument is denominated and any other currencies referenced by the 
instrument. 
 
8.2.49 
Despite paragraph 8.2.48, a Reporting Bank may, subject to the Authority’s 
written approval, calculate the delta risk capital requirement and the curvature risk capital 
requirement for the FX risk class relative to a base currency instead of the reporting 
currency of the Reporting Bank, provided that the Reporting Bank meets the following 
conditions:   
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank must specify only a single currency as its base 
currency;  
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank must demonstrate to the Authority, and ensure that 
calculating its delta risk capital requirement and its curvature risk capital 
requirement for the FX risk class relative to the proposed base currency – 
 
 
647  
For example, for a swap on the spread between WTI and Brent, the Reporting Bank must calculate delta 
risk weighted sensitivities to both WTI and Brent and aggregate the delta risk weighted sensitivities in 
accordance with paragraph 8.2.10(e), using the delta correlation parameter set out in paragraph 8.2.135. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore

(d) 
where the Reporting Bank has received the Authority’s written approval, 
the Reporting Bank must submit to the Authority on an annual basis, a 
written confirmation from the executive officer responsible for risk 
management in the Reporting Bank that the Reporting Bank continues to 
meet the conditions in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b). 
 
8.2.50 
A Reporting Bank which has obtained approval from the Authority to calculate 
the delta risk capital requirement and the curvature risk capital requirement for the FX

(a) 
specify FX delta risk factors for instruments with FX delta risks as the 
exchange rates between the currency in which each instrument is 
denominated and the base currency; 
 
(b) 
for an instrument that references an exchange rate between a pair of 
currencies which are both not the base currency, specify the FX delta risk 
factors as the exchange rates between the base currency, the currencies 
in which an instrument is denominated and any other currencies 
referenced by the instrument;  
 
(c)  include as a risk factor the exchange rate between the base currency and 
the reporting currency of the Reporting Bank to account for the FX 
translation risk between the reporting currency of the Reporting Bank and 
the base currency;  
 
(d) 
calculate the delta risk capital requirement for the FX risk class, in 
accordance with paragraph 8.2.10, in the base currency; and 
 
(e)  convert the delta risk capital requirement for the FX risk class calculated 
in sub-paragraph (d), to the delta risk capital requirement in the reporting 
currency of the Reporting Bank, using the spot exchange rate between the 
base currency and the reporting currency of the Reporting Bank.  
 
8.2.51 
A Reporting Bank must specify FX vega risk factors for instruments with FX vega 
risks as the implied volatilities of options that reference exchange rates between currency

8.2.52 
A Reporting Bank must specify FX curvature risk factors for instruments with 
FX curvature risks as the exchange rates between the currency in which each instrument 
is denominated and the reporting currency of the Reporting Bank. For an instrument that 
references an exchange rate between a pair of currencies which are both not the Reporting 
Bank’s reporting currency, the Reporting Bank must specify FX curvature risk factors as 
the exchange rates between the reporting currency of the Reporting Bank, the currencies 
in which the instrument is denominated and any other currencies referenced by the 
instrument. 
 
8.2.53 
Where a Reporting Bank has obtained approval from the Authority to calculate 
the delta risk capital requirement and the curvature risk capital requirement for the FX 
risk class relative to a base currency instead of the reporting currency of the Reporting 
Bank under paragraph 8.2.49, the Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a)  specify FX curvature risk factors for instruments with FX curvature risks 
as the exchange rates between the currency in which each instrument is 
denominated and the base currency; 
 
(b)  for an instrument that references an exchange rate between a pair of 
currencies which are both not the base currency, specify the FX curvature 
risk factors as the exchange rates between the base currency, the 
currencies in which an instrument is denominated and any other 
currencies referenced by the instrument; 
    
(c)  calculate the curvature risk capital requirement for the FX risk class 
relative to a base currency in accordance with paragraph 8.2.12, in the 
base currency; and  
  
(d)  convert the curvature risk capital requirement for the FX risk class 
calculated in sub-paragraph (c), to the curvature risk capital requirement 
in the reporting currency of the Reporting Bank using the spot exchange 
rate between the base currency and the reporting currency of the 
Reporting Bank. 
 
8.2.54 
A Reporting Bank must not treat onshore and offshore variants, and deliverable 
and non-deliverable variants, of a currency as distinct risk factors for FX delta, vega and 
curvature risks.

factor specified in paragraphs 8.2.15 to 8.2.54 and paragraphs 8.2.80 to 8.2.90, calculate 
a sensitivity to the risk factor as the change in the market value of the position in the 
instrument as a result of applying a specified shift to each risk factor, assuming all the 
other risk factors are held at the current level, in accordance with paragraphs 8.2.58 to 
8.2.90.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore

A Reporting Bank may, subject to the Authority’s written approval, use an 
alternative formulation of sensitivities based on pricing models that the Reporting Bank’s 
independent risk control unit uses to report market risks or actual P&L to senior 
management. A Reporting Bank seeking approval from the Authority to use an alternative 
formulation of sensitivities must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Authority, that the 
alternative formulation of sensitivities yields results that are very close to the prescribed 
formulations specified in paragraphs 8.2.58 to 8.2.90. 
 
 
 
 Sensitivity definitions for delta risk

instrument within the scope of paragraphs 8.2.4 and 8.2.6 to a given risk factor using the 
following formula: 
 
𝒔𝒌= 𝒗𝒆𝒈𝒂⁡ × 𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒊𝒆𝒅⁡𝒗𝒐𝒍𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 
 
 
where –  
 
(a)  vega, 
𝝏𝑽𝒊
𝝏𝝈𝒊, is defined as the change in the market value of the instrument 
𝑽𝒊 as a result of a small amount of change to the implied volatility, 𝝈𝒊; and   
 
(b)  a Reporting Bank must determine the instrument’s vega and implied 
volatility used in the calculation of vega risk sensitivities based on pricing 
models used by the risk control unit of the Reporting Bank.   
 
8.2.70 
A Reporting Bank must map options that do not have a maturity648 to the 10-
year maturity tenor when calculating its vega risk sensitivity649.   
 
8.2.71 
A Reporting Bank must use the strike prices and maturities, which are used 
internally to price the following instruments650, to calculate their vega risk sensitivities:  
 
(a)  options that do not have a strike price or barrier; 
 
(b)  options that have multiple strike prices or barriers. 
 
 
648  
For example, a cancellable swap.  
649  
The Reporting Bank must also subject such options to the RRAO in accordance with Sub-division 10 of 
this Division.  
650  
The Reporting Bank must also subject such options to the RRAO in accordance with Sub-division 10 of 
this Division.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-41 
8.2.72 
A Reporting Bank must not subject CTP securitisation exposures that do not 
have optionality to capital requirements for vega risks. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank 
must still subject CTP securitisation exposures that do not have optionality to capital 
requirements for delta and curvature risks. 
 
 
 
Requirements on sensitivity calculations 
 
8.2.73 
A Reporting Bank must determine each delta risk sensitivity, vega risk 
sensitivity and curvature scenario based on market prices or sensitivities that are used in 
pricing models that a risk control unit within the Reporting Bank uses to report market 
risks or actual P&L to senior management. A Reporting Bank must establish a framework 
for prudent valuation that satisfies the requirements in Annex 6C. 
 
8.2.74 
When calculating a delta risk sensitivity or vega risk sensitivity for instruments 
subject to optionality, a Reporting Bank must assume that the implied volatility either –  
 
(a)  remains constant651; or  
 
(b)  does not vary with respect to a given level of delta652. 
 
8.2.75 
For the calculation of vega risk sensitivities, a Reporting Bank must apply the 
following distribution assumptions for its pricing models: 
 
(a)  for the calculation of GIRR vega risk sensitivities, the Reporting Bank must 
use either the log-normal assumption or normal assumption653 for each 
currency. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank may use different 
distribution assumptions for different currencies; 
 
(b) 
for the calculation of CSR vega risk sensitivities, the Reporting Bank must 
use either the log-normal assumption or normal assumption654; 
 
(c)  for the calculation of equity, commodity or FX vega risk sensitivities, the 
Reporting Bank must use the log-normal assumption.   
 
8.2.76 
If a Reporting Bank calculates vega risk sensitivities using different risk factor 
or sensitivity definitions from the definitions set out in Sub-divisions 3 and 4 of this Division, 
respectively, for internal risk management, the Reporting Bank may transform the vega 
risk sensitivities calculated for internal risk management to determine the vega risk 
sensitivities as defined in this Division. 
 
8.2.77 
A Reporting Bank must disregard the impact of credit valuation adjustments 
when calculating vega risk sensitivities. 
 
 
651  
This is referred to as a “sticky strike” approach.  
652  
This is referred to as a “sticky delta” approach.  
653  
Since vega (
𝜕𝑉
𝜕𝜎𝑖) of an instrument is multiplied by its implied volatility (𝜎𝑖), the vega risk sensitivity for that 
instrument will be the same under the log-normal assumption and the normal assumption.  
654  
Since vega (
𝜕𝑉
𝜕𝜎𝑖) of an instrument is multiplied by its implied volatility (𝜎𝑖), the vega risk sensitivity for that 
instrument will be the same under the log-normal assumption and the normal assumption. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-42 
8.2.78 
A Reporting Bank must, for a given instrument, irrespective of whether a look-
through approach is adopted or not, use the same delta sensitivity inputs for the delta risk 
and curvature risk calculation. 
 
8.2.79 
For the purposes of calculating the net curvature risk position after applying an 
upward shock or downward shock, referred to in paragraph 8.2.12(b), a Reporting Bank 
must use the same assumption in paragraph 8.2.74 that is applied in the calculation of 
the delta risk capital requirement, for calculating the price of the instrument after it is 
shocked upward or downward, referred to in paragraph 8.2.12(b)(iv). 
 
 
Sub-division 5: SBM – Risk Factors and Sensitivities for Instruments with Multiple 
Constituents 
 
8.2.80 
For the purposes of this Division, a qualified index means a credit index or 
equity index, that is widely-recognised, and that satisfies all of the following conditions:  
 
(a) 
the index is listed on an approved exchange or overseas exchange;  
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank is able to look through the credit index or equity index, 
such that the constituents of the credit index or equity index and their 
respective weightings are known to the Reporting Bank; 
 
(c)  the credit index or equity index contains at least 20 constituents; 
 
(d)  no single constituent within the credit index or equity index has a 
weighting of more than 25% of the index; 
 
(e)  the sum of the weightings of the largest 10% of the index constituents, 
based on the weightings of the index constituents, represent less than     
60% of the credit index or equity index;  
 
(f)  the market capitalisation of all the constituents of the credit index or 
equity index is greater than or equal to USD 40 billion. 
 
8.2.81 
Subject to paragraphs 8.2.84 and 8.2.85, a Reporting Bank must use a look-
through approach to calculate the capital requirements for delta risk and the capital 
requirements for curvature risk, arising from a multi-underlying instrument or an index 
instrument, for the following instruments:  
 
(a)  instruments referencing a qualified index; 
 
(b)  instruments referencing an index which is not a qualified index; 
 
(c)  multi-underlying instruments, including such instruments that reference a 
bespoke set of equities or credit positions. 
 
8.2.82 
A Reporting Bank applying the look-through approach pursuant to paragraph 
8.2.81 must calculate the sensitivity of a multi-underlying instrument or index instrument, 
to all risk factors upon which the value of the multi-underlying instrument or index 
instrument depends, by –  
 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-43 
(a)  applying a specified shift of each risk factor, in accordance with paragraphs 
8.2.58 to 8.2.79, to all constituents of the multi-underlying instrument or 
index instrument that are sensitive to the risk factor; and 
 
(b)  recalculating the changed value of the multi-underlying instrument or 
index instrument. 
 
8.2.83 
Where a Reporting Bank has applied the look-through approach pursuant to 
paragraph 8.2.81 and in accordance with paragraph 8.2.82 –  
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank is allowed to offset the sensitivities of the constituents 
of multi-underlying instruments or index instruments, to a risk factor, with 
sensitivities of single name instruments to the same risk factor; and 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank must apply the look-through approach for all identical 
instruments that reference the same index. 
 
8.2.84 
Despite paragraph 8.2.81, a Reporting Bank must not apply the look-through 
approach set out in paragraph 8.2.82 for CTP instruments that reference index 
underlyings 655  and the Reporting Bank must not apply the offsetting mentioned in 
paragraph 8.2.83(a). 
 
8.2.85 
Despite paragraph 8.2.81(a), for delta and curvature risks of the CSR (non-
securitisation) and equity risk classes arising from a multi-underlying instrument or an 
index instrument, that reference a qualified index, a Reporting Bank may choose to not 
use the look-through approach. If a Reporting Bank chooses not to use the look-through 
approach, the Reporting Bank must specify risk factors that directly correspond to the 
qualified index and calculate sensitivities to such risk factors by applying a specified shift 
of each risk factor, in accordance with paragraphs 8.2.58 to 8.2.90, to the qualified index. 
Once a Reporting Bank has applied the look-through approach pursuant to paragraph 
8.2.81 and in accordance with paragraph 8.2.82, it must use the look-through approach, 
unless it obtains the written approval of the Authority to revert to not using the look-
through approach.  
 
8.2.86 
For delta and curvature risks arising from an equity investment in a fund where 
the condition in paragraph 8.1.27(e)(i) is met, a Reporting Bank must apply the look-
through approach set out in paragraph 8.2.82 and treat the underlying positions of the 
fund as if the positions were held directly by the Reporting Bank, based on the Reporting 
Bank’s share of the equity of the fund, and taking into account any leverage in the fund 
structure.  
 
8.2.87 
Despite paragraph 8.2.86, a Reporting Bank may choose not to apply the look-
through approach in either of the following cases:  
 
(a)  for a fund that holds an index instrument that references a qualified index, 
a Reporting Bank may, for the index instrument, specify risk factors that 
directly correspond to a qualified index, and calculate sensitivities to such 
risk factors by applying a specified shift of each risk factor, in accordance 
with paragraphs 8.2.58 to 8.2.90, to the qualified index. To avoid doubt, 
 
655  
This means the Reporting Bank must specify risk factors that correspond to the underlying index.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-44 
the Reporting Bank must still apply the look-through approach for the 
other underlying positions of the fund;   
 
(b) 
for a fund that tracks a qualified index benchmark, a Reporting Bank may 
specify risk factors that directly correspond to the tracked index and 
calculate sensitivities to such risk factors, by applying a specified shift of 
each risk factor, in accordance with paragraphs 8.2.58 to 8.2.90, to the 
tracked index, as if the position in the fund is a position in the tracked 
index, where –  
 
(i)  
the fund has an absolute value of a tracking difference (ignoring fees 
and commissions) of less than 1%; and 
 
(ii)  the tracking difference, calculated as the annualised return 
difference between the fund and its tracked benchmark over the last 
12 months of available data (or the longest period for which data is 
available, in the absence of a full 12 months of data), is checked by 
the Reporting Bank at least annually. 
 
8.2.88 
 For an equity investment in a fund where the condition in paragraph 8.1.27(e)(i) 
is not met but the condition in paragraph 8.1.27(e)(ii) is met, a Reporting Bank must, for 
the purposes of calculating capital requirements for the fund –  
 
(a)  subject to the Authority’s written approval, treat the fund as a hypothetical 
portfolio in which the fund invests to the maximum extent allowed under 
the fund’s mandate in those exposures attracting the highest capital 
requirements, and then progressively in those exposures attracting lower 
capital requirements in descending order under the SBM until the total 
investment is reached. If more than one risk weight is applicable to a given 
exposure under the SBM, the Reporting Bank must use the maximum risk 
weight applicable, to determine which exposure attracts the higher capital 
requirement. The Reporting Bank must also –  
 
(i)  
calculate  the market risk capital requirements of the hypothetical 
portfolio on a stand-alone basis for all positions in that fund, by 
assuming the positions are in a discrete, non-diversifiable portfolio 
such that the risk positions in the hypothetical portfolio cannot be 
diversified, hedged or offset by other risk positions that are subject 
to market risk capital requirements; and 
 
(ii)  calculate the counterparty credit and CVA risks of the derivatives of 
the hypothetical portfolio in accordance with paragraph 7.5.14(c) of 
Division 5 of Part VII; or  
 
(b)  treat the equity investment in the fund as an unrated equity exposure and 
assign it to delta risk bucket 11 (Other sector).    
 
 
8.2.89 
Despite paragraph 8.2.88, for an equity investment in a fund where the 
condition in paragraph 8.1.27(e)(i) is not met but the condition in paragraph 8.1.27(e)(ii) 
is met, a Reporting Bank may specify risk factors that directly correspond to the tracked 
index and calculate sensitivities to such risk factors by applying a specified shift of each 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-45 
risk factor, in accordance with paragraphs 8.2.58 to 8.2.90, to the tracked index, as if the 
position in the fund is a position in the tracked index, only where – 
 
(a) 
the fund tracks a qualified index benchmark; and  
 
(b) 
the fund meets the requirements set out in paragraph 8.2.87(b)(i) and 
(ii).  
 
8.2.90 
For vega risk arising from a multi-underlying instrument or an index instrument, 
a Reporting Bank must apply one of the following methods for the purposes of the 
calculation of its vega risk capital requirement:  
 
(a)  the look-through approach, as if the Reporting Bank directly holds 
individual positions in the underlying constituents of the multi-underlying 
instrument or index instrument;  
 
(b)  an approach where the Reporting Bank specifies risk factors that directly 
correspond to the multi-underlying instrument or index instrument and 
calculates sensitivities to each risk factor by applying a specified shift of 
the risk factor, in accordance with paragraphs 8.2.58 to 8.2.90. 
 
The Reporting Bank must apply either method, regardless of whether the Reporting Bank 
adopted a look-through approach for the calculation of its delta risk and curvature risk 
capital requirements656.  
 
 
Sub-division 6: SBM – Definition of Delta Risk Buckets, Risk Weights and 
Correlations 
 
 
GIRR delta risk buckets, risk weights and correlations 
 
8.2.91 
A Reporting Bank must define each currency as a separate delta risk bucket.  
The Reporting Bank must assign the following GIRR delta risk sensitivities into the same 
delta risk bucket: 
  
(a)  GIRR delta risk sensitivities arising from risk factors that are risk-free 
yields of risk-free yield curves of the same currency; 
 
(b)  GIRR delta risk sensitivities arising from risk factors that are inflation rates 
of the same currency; 
 
(c)  GIRR delta risk sensitivities arising from risk factors that are cross-
currency bases of the same currency over either USD or EUR. 
 
8.2.92 
For the purposes of calculating the delta risk weighted sensitivities pursuant to 
paragraph 8.2.10(d), a Reporting Bank must –  
 
 
656  
This is reflective of how multi-underlying options (including index options) are priced based on the implied 
volatility of the option, rather than the implied volatility of its underlying constituents.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-46 
(a)  divide the risk weights in Table 8-1 by the square root of 2 and apply the 
resultant risk weight for each tenor in the risk-free curves for the following 
currencies: EUR, USD, GBP, AUD, JPY, SEK, CAD and SGD; 
 
(b)  apply the risk weights in Table 8-1 for each tenor in the risk-free curves 
for currencies not set out in sub-paragraph (a);  
 
(c)  divide the risk weight of 1.6% by the square root of 2 and apply the 
resultant risk weight for the inflation risk factor and the cross-currency 
basis risk factor for the following currencies: EUR, USD, GBP, AUD, JPY, 
SEK, CAD and SGD; and 
 
(d)  apply a risk weight of 1.6% for the inflation risk factor and the cross-
currency basis risk factor for currencies not set out in sub-paragraph (c).

For the purposes of calculating the GIRR delta risk position for a delta risk 
bucket pursuant to paragraph 8.2.10(e), a Reporting Bank must set the delta risk 
correlation parameter 𝝆𝒌𝒍 between delta risk weighted sensitivities 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 𝑾𝑺𝒍, arising 
from risk factors that are risk-free yields for risk-free yield curves, that are assigned to 
the same delta risk bucket, as – 
 
(a)  99.90%, if the delta risk weighted sensitivities 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 𝑾𝑺𝒍 have the 
same assigned tenor but are to different curves; 
  
 
(b)  a correlation value in accordance with Table 8-2 657, if the delta risk 
weighted sensitivities 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 𝑾𝑺𝒍 have different tenors but are to the 
same curve; and 
 
(c)  the correlation value specified in sub-paragraph (b) multiplied by 
99.90% 658 , if the delta risk weighted sensitivities 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 𝑾𝑺𝒍 have 
different tenors and are to different curves. 
 
657  
The delta risk correlation parameters (𝝆𝒌𝒍) set out in Table 8-2 is determined by max[𝑒
(−𝜃.
|𝑇𝑘−𝑇𝑙|
𝑚𝑖𝑛{𝑇𝑘;𝑇𝑙});40%], 
where 𝑇𝑘 (respectively 𝑇𝑙) is the tenor that relates to 𝑊𝑆𝑘 (respectively 𝑊𝑆𝑙); and 𝜃 is set at 3%.  For 
example, the correlation between a sensitivity to the one-year tenor of the Eonia swap curve and the 
sensitivity to the 5-year Eonia swap curve in the same currency is max[𝑒
(−3%.
|1−5|
𝑚𝑖𝑛{1;5});40%] = 88.69%.  
658  
For example, the correlation between a sensitivity to the one-year tenor of the Eonia swap curve and a 
sensitivity to the 5-year tenor of the 3-month Euribor swap curve in the same currency is (88.69%).(0.999) 
= 88.60%.

For the purposes of calculating the GIRR delta risk position for a delta risk 
bucket pursuant to paragraph 8.2.10(e), a Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
calculate the sum of all delta risk weighted sensitivities 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 𝑾𝑺𝒍, 
arising from inflation rates, that are assigned to the same delta risk bucket, 
if the delta risk weighted sensitivities 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 𝑾𝑺𝒍 are to the same 
inflation curve; and 
 
(b) 
set the delta risk correlation parameter 𝝆𝒌𝒍 between delta risk weighted 
sensitivities 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 𝑾𝑺𝒍, arising from risk factors that are inflation rates, 
that are assigned to the same delta risk bucket, as 99.90%, if the delta 
risk weighted sensitivities 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 𝑾𝑺𝒍 are to different inflation curves659. 
 
8.2.95 
For the purposes of calculating the GIRR delta risk position for a delta risk 
bucket pursuant to paragraph 8.2.10(e), a Reporting Bank must set the delta risk 
correlation parameter 𝝆𝒌𝒍 between delta risk weighted sensitivities 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 𝑾𝑺𝒍, arising 
from risk factors that are cross-currency bases over either USD or EUR, that are assigned 
to the same delta risk bucket as 99.90%, if the delta risk weighted sensitivities 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 
𝑾𝑺𝒍 are to different curves.

For example, the German and French inflation curves, which are in the same currency, EUR. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-48 
 
8.2.96 
Despite paragraph 8.2.95, if the delta risk weighted sensitivities, 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 𝑾𝑺𝒍 , 
mentioned in paragraph 8.2.95 are to an onshore curve and an offshore curve, respectively, 
and both curves are over USD or both curves are over EUR, a Reporting Bank may 
aggregate the delta risk weighted sensitivities, 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 𝑾𝑺𝒍 , by calculating the sum of 
the delta risk weighted sensitivities. 
 
8.2.97 
For the purposes of calculating the GIRR delta risk position for a delta risk 
bucket pursuant to paragraph 8.2.10(e), a Reporting Bank must set the delta risk 
correlation parameter 𝝆𝒌𝒍 between – 
 
(a)  a delta weighted sensitivity 𝑾𝑺𝒌 to an inflation rate; and  
 
(b) 
a delta weighted sensitivity 𝑾𝑺𝒍 to a risk-free yield of a given tenor of a 
risk-free yield curve,  
 
assigned to the same delta risk bucket, as 40%. 
 
8.2.98 
For the purposes of calculating the GIRR delta risk position for a delta risk 
bucket pursuant to paragraph 8.2.10(e), a Reporting Bank must set the delta risk 
correlation parameter 𝝆𝒌𝒍 between a delta weighted sensitivity 𝑾𝑺𝒌 to a cross-currency 
basis and a delta weighted sensitivity 𝑾𝑺𝒍 to each of the following, assigned to the same 
delta risk bucket, as 0% –   
 
(a)  a risk-free yield of a given tenor of the relevant risk-free yield curve; 
 
(b) 
 an inflation rate; or 
 
(c)  another cross-currency basis. 
 
8.2.99 
For the purposes of aggregating GIRR delta risk positions for all delta risk 
buckets pursuant to paragraph 8.2.10(f) and (g), a Reporting Bank must set the 
correlation parameter 𝜸𝒃𝒄 as 50%. 
 
 
 
CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk buckets, risk weights and correlations 
 
8.2.100 
A Reporting Bank must assign the CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk 
sensitivities, to the sector set out in Table 8-3 to which the reference entity underlying the 
CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk sensitivity belongs. To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank 
must assign a CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk sensitivity to delta risk bucket 16 (Other 
sector) where the reference entity underlying the CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk 
sensitivity cannot be assigned to a specific sector in delta risk buckets 1 to 15. 
 
8.2.101 
Where a Reporting Bank uses a look-through approach pursuant to paragraph 
8.2.81 or 8.2.86, a Reporting Bank must assign the CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk 
sensitivities arising from positions in index constituents, to the sector set out in Table 8-3 
to which the index constituent underlying the CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk sensitivity 
belongs. To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must assign a CSR (non-securitisation) delta 
risk sensitivity to delta risk bucket 16 (Other sector) where the index constituent 
underlying the CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk sensitivity cannot be assigned to a 
specific sector in delta risk buckets 1 to 15.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-49 
 
8.2.102 
Where a Reporting Bank calculates delta risk sensitivities to the risk factors that 
directly correspond to an index –  
 
(a)  if more than 75% of the constituents of the index, based on the weightings 
of the constituents of the index, are mapped to the same sector, the 
Reporting Bank must assign the CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk 
sensitivities to the index, to the sector set out in Table 8-3 corresponding 
to delta risk buckets 1 to 16; and 
 
(b)  in all other cases, the Reporting Bank must assign the CSR (non-
securitisation) delta risk sensitivities to the risk factors that directly 
correspond to the index to delta risk buckets 17 or 18 set out in Table 8-
3. 
 
8.2.103 
For the purposes of paragraphs 8.2.100, 8.2.101 and 8.2.102, to assign a CSR 
(non-securitisation) delta risk sensitivity of a reference entity or index constituent to a 
sector, a Reporting Bank must –   
 
(a)  rely on a classification that is commonly used in the market for assigning 
issuers to industry sectors; and  
 
(b)  assign each reference entity or index constituent to only one of the sectors 
in Table 8-3, except for issuers of covered bonds. For an issuer of covered 
bonds, the Reporting Bank must assign the CSR (non-securitisation) delta 
risk sensitivities arising from other credit instruments which are not 
covered bonds to the respective sectors, and the CSR (non-securitisation) 
delta risk sensitivities arising from the covered bonds to delta risk bucket 
8. 
 
8.2.104 
Except for a CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk sensitivity assigned to delta risk 
bucket 16 (Other sector) of Table 8-3 pursuant to paragraphs 8.2.100, 8.2.101 or 
8.2.102(a), a Reporting Bank must assign CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk sensitivities 
to delta risk buckets set out in Table 8-3 as follows: 
 
(a)  if a reference entity or an index constituent, underlying the CSR (non-
securitisation) delta risk sensitivity, has one or more external credit 
assessments by recognised ECAIs, the Reporting Bank must assign the 
CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk sensitivity to a delta risk bucket 
corresponding to –  
 
(i)  
the sector assigned to the reference entity in paragraph 8.2.100 or 
the sector assigned to the index constituent in paragraph 8.2.101, 
as the case may be; and 
 
(ii)  the credit quality of the reference entity or index constituent, 
underlying the CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk sensitivity, as the 
case may be, where the credit quality is determined in accordance 
with paragraph 7.3.30 and is based on the external credit 
assessment of the reference entity or the index constituent, as the 
case may be, by recognised ECAIs;  
 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-50 
(b)  if a reference entity or an index constituent, underlying the CSR (non-
securitisation) delta risk sensitivity does not have an external credit 
assessment by a recognised ECAI –  
 
(i)  
in the case where the Reporting Bank has obtained approval from 
the Authority to adopt the IRBA pursuant to Division 4 of Part VII, 
the Reporting Bank may, with the prior written approval of the 
Authority, internally rate the reference entity or the index constituent, 
as the case may be, map the internal rating under the IRBA, of the 
reference entity or the index constituent, as the case may be, to a 
credit quality grade set out in Table 7M-1, and assign the CSR (non-
securitisation) sensitivity, to a delta risk bucket corresponding to –  
 
(A)  the sector assigned to the reference entity in paragraph 
8.2.100 or the sector assigned to the index constituent in 
paragraph 8.2.101, as the case may be; and 
 
(B)  the credit quality associated with the reference entity or the 
index constituent underlying the CSR (non-securitisation) delta 
risk sensitivity, as the case may be; and  
 
(ii)  in all other cases, the Reporting Bank must assign a delta risk bucket 
corresponding to –  
 
(A)  the sector assigned to the reference entity in paragraph 
8.2.100 or the sector assigned to the index constituent in 
paragraph 8.2.101, as the case may be; and 
 
(B)  a credit quality of “not rated”;  
 
(c)  where the Reporting Bank calculates delta risk sensitivities to the risk 
factors that directly correspond to an index –  
 
(i)  
if 75% or more of the constituents of the index, based on the 
weightings of the constituents of the index, each has one or more 
external credit assessments by recognised ECAIs which correspond 
to credit quality grades of “3” or better as set out in Table 7M-1, the 
Reporting Bank must assign the CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk 
sensitivities to a delta risk bucket corresponding to the sector 
assigned under paragraph 8.2.102 and a credit quality grade of “3” 
or better as set out in Table 7M-1. The Reporting Bank must 
determine the credit quality of each constituent in accordance with 
paragraph 7.3.30; and 
 
(ii)  in all other cases, the Reporting Bank must assign the CSR (non-
securitisation) delta risk sensitivities to a delta risk bucket 
corresponding to the sector assigned under paragraph 8.2.102, and 
a credit quality of “not rated”.

8.2.108 
For delta risk buckets 1 to 15, for the purposes of calculating the CSR (non-
securitisation) delta risk position for a delta risk bucket pursuant to paragraph 8.2.10(e), 
a Reporting Bank must set the delta risk correlation parameter 𝝆𝒌𝒍 between delta risk 
weighted sensitivities 𝑾𝑺𝒌 and 𝑾𝑺𝒍 within the same delta risk bucket, as follows661:  
 
𝝆𝒌𝒍= 𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝒏𝒂𝒎𝒆). 𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒐𝒓). 𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝒃𝒂𝒔𝒊𝒔) 
 
 
where – 
 
(a)  𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝒏𝒂𝒎𝒆) is equal to – 
 
(i) 
100%, if the 2 names underlying the 2 delta risk weighted 
sensitivities k and l are identical; and  
 
(ii) 
35%, in all other cases; 
 
 
661  
For example, the delta risk correlation value that needs to be applied for aggregating a delta risk weighted 
sensitivity to the 5-year Apple bond curve and a delta risk weighted sensitivity to the 10-year Google CDS 
curve would be: 35%.65%.99.90% = 22.73%

(ii) 
99.90%, if one delta risk weighted sensitivity is related to the bond 
curve and the other related to the CDS curve. 
 
8.2.110 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk position

8.2.111 
For the purposes of aggregating CSR (non-securitisation) delta risk positions 
for all delta risk buckets pursuant to paragraph 8.2.10(f) and (g), a Reporting Bank must 
use the correlation parameter 𝜸𝒃𝒄 as follows:  
 
𝜸𝒃𝒄= 𝜸𝒃𝒄

8.2.112 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.2.111(a), a Reporting Bank must treat the 
credit quality of 2 delta risk buckets to be the same in the following cases: 
 
(a)  if both delta risk buckets have credit quality grades of “3” or better, as set 
out in Table 7M-1; 
 
(b)  if both delta risk buckets have credit quality grades of “4” or worse, as set 
out in Table 7M-1;

8.2.126 
A Reporting Bank must assign the equity delta risk sensitivities to a delta risk 
bucket set out in Table 8-9 that corresponds to – 
 
(a) 
the market capitalisation of the equity underlying the equity delta risk 
sensitivity; and  
 
(b) 
the economy and sector to which the issuer of the equity underlying the 
equity delta risk sensitivity belongs. 
 
8.2.127 
Where a Reporting Bank uses a look-through approach pursuant to paragraphs 
8.2.81 or 8.2.86, a Reporting Bank must assign the equity delta risk sensitivities arising 
from positions in index constituents to a delta risk bucket set out in Table 8-9 that 
corresponds to – 
 
(a)  the market capitalisation of the index constituent underlying the equity 
delta risk sensitivity; and  
 
(b) 
the economy and sector to which the issuer of the index constituent 
belongs. 
 
8.2.128 
Where a Reporting Bank calculates delta risk sensitivities to the risk factors that 
directly correspond to an index, the Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a)  if more than 75% of the constituents of the index, based on the weightings 
of the constituents of the index, are mapped to the same sector, assign 
the equity delta risk sensitivities to the sector set out in Table 8-9 
corresponding to delta risk buckets 1 to 11 of Table 8-9.  In all other cases, 
the Reporting Bank must assign the equity delta risk sensitivities to delta 
risk bucket 12 or 13 of Table 8-9; 
 
(b)  for equity delta risk sensitivities that have been assigned to a specific 
sector set out in Table 8-9 corresponding to delta risk buckets 1 to 10 of 
Table 8-9 in accordance with sub-paragraph (a) –  
 
(i)  
assign the equity delta risk sensitivities to a delta risk bucket that 
corresponds to large market capitalisation, if 75% or more of the 
constituents of the index, based on the weightings of the 
constituents of the index, have a large market capitalisation.  In all 
other cases, the Reporting Bank must assign the equity delta risk 
sensitivities to a bucket that corresponds to small market 
capitalisation; and 
 
(ii)  assign the equity delta risk sensitivities to a delta risk bucket that 
corresponds to advanced economy, if 75% or more of the 
constituents of the index, based on the weightings of the 
constituents of the index, are from an advanced economy.  In all 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-61 
other cases, the Reporting Bank must assign the equity delta risk 
sensitivities to a delta risk bucket that corresponds to emerging 
market economy; and 
 
(c)  for the equity delta risk sensitivities which have been assigned to delta 
risk bucket 12 or 13 of Table 8-9 in accordance with sub-paragraph (a), 
assign the equity delta risk sensitivities to delta risk bucket 12 if 75% or 
more of the constituents of the index, based on the weightings of the 
constituents of the index, each have a large market capitalisation and are 
from an advanced economy.  In all other cases, the Reporting Bank must 
assign the equity delta risk sensitivities to delta risk bucket 13 of Table 8-

8.2.146 
Subject to paragraph 8.2.148, for the purposes of calculating the vega risk 
position for a vega risk bucket for the risk classes other than the GIRR risk class pursuant 
to paragraph 8.2.11(e), a Reporting Bank must set the vega risk correlation parameter 𝝆𝒌𝒍 
as follows:  
 
𝝆𝒌𝒍= 𝒎𝒊𝒏[𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝑫𝑬𝑳𝑻𝑨). 𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝒐𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏⁡𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒚); 𝟏] 
 
 
where – 
 
(a) 
 𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝑫𝑬𝑳𝑻𝑨) is equal to the correlation that applies between the delta risk 
factors that correspond to vega risk factors k and l672; and 
 
(b)  𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝒐𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏⁡𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒚) is as defined in paragraph 8.2.145. 
 
8.2.147  For the purposes of determining 𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝑫𝑬𝑳𝑻𝑨) for the CSR (non-securitisation), CSR 
(securitisation: CTP), CSR (securitisation: non-CTP) and commodity risk classes in 
paragraph 8.2.146(a), a Reporting Bank must only use the risk factor dimensions that are 
specified in both the delta risk factor and vega risk factor, as follows:  
 
(a)  for the CSR (non-securitisation) and CSR (securitisation: CTP) risk classes: 
underlying name (𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝒏𝒂𝒎𝒆)); 
 
(b)  for the CSR (securitisation: non-CTP) risk class: securitisation tranche 
(𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒉𝒆)); 
 
(c)  for the commodity risk class: commodity (𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝒄𝒕𝒚)).  
 
8.2.148 
For the CSR (non-securitisation), CSR (securitisation: CTP), CSR (securitisation: 
non-CTP) and equity risk classes, a Reporting Bank must calculate the vega risk position 
for the Other sector vega risk bucket for each risk class pursuant to paragraph 8.2.11(e) 
 
672  
For example, if k is the vega risk factor from equity option X and l is the vega risk factor from equity option 
Y, 𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝑫𝑬𝑳𝑻𝑨) is the delta risk correlation parameter applicable between X and Y.

8.2.149 
For the purposes of aggregating vega risk positions for all vega risk buckets 
within a risk class pursuant to paragraph 8.2.11(f) and (g), a Reporting Bank must –   
 
(a)  apply the same correlation parameter for 𝜸𝒃𝒄, as specified for delta risk 
correlations for each risk class in paragraphs 8.2.99, 8.2.111, 8.2.118,

(b)  aggregate CSR (securitisation: non-CTP) vega risk positions between vega 
risk bucket 25 (Other sector) and vega risk buckets 1 to 24 by calculating 
the sum of – 
  
 
(i)  
the vega risk position for vega risk bucket 25 (Other sector); and  
  
 
(ii)  the aggregated vega risk position for vega risk buckets 1 to 24 
pursuant to sub-paragraph (a). 
 
 
Sub-division 8: SBM – Definition of Curvature Risk Buckets, Risk Weights and 
Correlations 
 
8.2.150 
For the purposes of calculating the curvature risk capital requirement for each 
risk class, a Reporting Bank must use the same risk bucket definitions for each risk class, 
which have been defined in paragraphs 8.2.91, 8.2.100, 8.2.114, 8.2.119, 8.2.126, 
8.2.134 and 8.2.138, for the calculation of the delta risk capital requirement for each risk 
class.  
 
8.2.151 
For the purposes of calculating the net curvature risk position for curvature risk 
factor k for the FX and equity risk classes pursuant to paragraph 8.2.12(a) and (b), a 
Reporting Bank must set the risk weight for the curvature risk factor k as the respective 
delta risk weight. 
 
8.2.152 
For the FX risk class, a Reporting Bank may calculate the net curvature risk 
position for instruments for which FX curvature risk capital requirement is calculated 
pursuant to paragraph 8.2.12(b), by either –  
 
 
(a) 
using the formula in paragraph 8.2.12(b), except that for instruments that 
do not reference the reporting currency, or the base currency in the case 
where the Reporting Bank calculates FX risk relative to a base currency, 
of the Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank must divide the curvature risk 
positions referred to in paragraph 8.2.12(b)(vii) and (viii) by a scalar of 
1.5; or 
 
 
673  
For example, for the GIRR risk class, the Reporting Bank must use 𝜸𝒃𝒄=50% for the aggregation of vega 
risk sensitivities across different GIRR vega risk buckets. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-72 
(b)  subject to the written approval of the Authority, dividing the net curvature 
risk positions (𝑪𝑽𝑹𝒌
+ and 𝑪𝑽𝑹𝒌
−) calculated using the formula in paragraph 
8.2.12(b) by a scalar of 1.5 for all instruments for which FX curvature risk 
capital requirement is calculated, provided the Reporting Bank calculates 
FX curvature risk positions by shocking all currencies, including shocking 
the reporting currency (or base currency) of the Reporting Bank relative 
to all other currencies.  
 
8.2.153 
For the purposes of calculating the net curvature risk position for GIRR, CSR 
(non-securitisation), CSR (securitisation: non-CTP), CSR (securitisation: CTP) and 
commodity risk classes pursuant to paragraph 8.2.12(a) and (b), a Reporting Bank must 
set the risk weight for the curvature risk factor k as the highest prescribed delta risk weight 
in the delta risk bucket674 corresponding to the curvature risk bucket to which curvature 
risk factor k belongs. 
 
8.2.154 
For the purposes of calculating the curvature risk position for a curvature risk 
bucket pursuant to paragraph 8.2.12(d), a Reporting Bank must calculate the curvature 
risk correlation parameter 𝝆𝒌𝒍 by squaring the corresponding delta risk correlation 
parameters  𝝆𝒌𝒍, except for the CSR (non-securitisation), CSR (securitisation: CTP), CSR 
(securitisation: non-CTP) and commodity risk classes675. 
 
8.2.155 
For the purposes of calculating the curvature risk correlation 𝝆𝒌𝒍 for the CSR 
(non-securitisation), CSR (securitisation: CTP), CSR (securitisation: non-CTP) and 
commodity risk classes, a Reporting Bank must only use the risk factor dimensions that 
are specified in both the delta risk factor and the curvature risk factor as follows: 
 
(a)  for the CSR (non-securitisation) and CSR (securitisation: CTP) risk classes, 
the Reporting Bank must set the curvature risk correlation parameter as 
the square of the correlation parameter 𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝒏𝒂𝒎𝒆); 
 
(b)  for the CSR (securitisation: non-CTP) risk class, the Reporting Bank must 
set the curvature risk correlation parameter as the square of the 
correlation parameter 𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒉𝒆); 
 
(c)  for the commodity risk class, the Reporting Bank must set the curvature 
correlation risk parameter as the square of the correlation parameter 𝝆𝒌𝒍
(𝒄𝒕𝒚).   
 
8.2.156  Despite paragraphs 8.2.154 and 8.2.155, for the  CSR (non-securitisation), CSR 
(securitisation: CTP), CSR (securitisation: non CTP) and equity risk classes, a Reporting 
Bank must aggregate the curvature risk positions within the Other sector curvature risk 
bucket for each risk class for the purposes of calculating the curvature risk position 
pursuant to paragraph 8.2.12(d) using the following formula:  
 
𝑲𝒃(𝒐𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓⁡𝒔𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒐𝒓⁡𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆⁡𝒓𝒊𝒔𝒌⁡𝒃𝒖𝒄𝒌𝒆𝒕) = 𝒎𝒂𝒙(∑𝐦𝐚𝐱(𝑪𝑽𝑹𝒌
+, 𝟎) ,
𝒌
∑𝐦𝐚𝐱(𝑪𝑽𝑹𝒌
−, 𝟎)
𝒌
) 
 
 
674  
For example, in the case of GIRR, for a given currency (i.e. delta risk bucket), the risk weight assigned to 
the 0.25-year tenor (i.e. the most punitive tenor risk weight) is applied to all the tenors simultaneously for 
each risk-free yield curve. 
675  
The curvature risk factor is defined differently from the corresponding delta risk factor for the CSR (non-
securitisation), CSR (securitisation: CTP), CSR (securitisation: non-CTP) and commodity risk classes.

Sub-division 9: Default Risk Capital 
 
 
Overview of DRC requirement calculation 
 
8.2.158 
A Reporting Bank must subject equity and credit instruments within the trading 
book, which are subject to default risk, to DRC requirements. 
 
8.2.159 
A Reporting Bank must assign each instrument within the scope of paragraph 
8.2.158 to one of the following components: 
 
(a)  non-securitisations677; 
(b)  securitisations (non-CTP); 
 
(c)  securitisations (CTP). 
 
8.2.160 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.2.159, a Reporting Bank must assign 
instruments that are not securitisation exposures and that hedge securitisation exposures 
in the CTP, to the securitisations (CTP) component. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank 
must not include such instruments in the non-securitisations component.  
 
8.2.161 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the DRC requirement for each component in 
paragraph 8.2.159 as follows: 
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank must calculate the gross JTD position of each exposure 
for each instrument subject to default risk separately, in accordance with 
paragraphs 8.2.168 to 8.2.175 for the non-securitisations component, 
paragraphs 8.2.188 to 8.2.189 for the securitisations (non-CTP) 
component, and paragraphs 8.2.198 to 8.2.200 for the securitisations 
(CTP) component; 
 
(b)  with respect to the same reference entity678, the Reporting Bank must 
offset, where permissible, the JTD amounts of long and short exposures 
to produce net long or net short JTD positions, for each reference entity; 
 
(c)  the Reporting Bank must assign net JTD positions to the buckets set out 
in paragraph 8.2.183 for the non-securitisations component, paragraph 
8.2.194 for the securitisations (non-CTP) component and in accordance 
with paragraph 8.2.206 for the securitisations (CTP) component; 
 
 
676  
For example, when aggregating 𝑪𝑽𝑹𝑬𝑼𝑹 and 𝑪𝑽𝑹𝑼𝑺𝑫 for the GIRR risk class, the curvature risk correlation is 
𝟓𝟎%𝟐= 𝟐𝟓%. 
677  
To avoid doubt, this comprises credit instruments, including equity instruments, which are not securitisation 
exposures.  
678  
The reference entity is the issuer (in the case of a bond or equity), or an obligor (in the case of other credit 
obligations).  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-74 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank must calculate a bucket-level DRC requirement for 
each bucket in accordance with paragraph 8.2.184 for the non-
securitisations component, paragraph 8.2.196 for the securitisations (non-
CTP) component and paragraph 8.2.208 for the securitisations (CTP) 
component; 
 
(e)  the Reporting Bank must aggregate the bucket-level DRC requirement for 
each component in accordance with paragraph 8.2.187 for the non-
securitisations component, paragraph 8.2.197 for the securitisations (non-
CTP) component and paragraph 8.2.209 for the securitisations (CTP) 
component.  
 
8.2.162 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the overall DRC requirement for the 
components in paragraph 8.2.159 by calculating the sum of the DRC requirement for each 
component calculated under paragraph 8.2.161(e)679.  
 
8.2.163 
For a non-securitisation credit derivative or an equity derivative, a Reporting 
Bank must determine the JTD position with respect to the underlying reference entity.  
 
8.2.164 
For a multi-underlying instrument or an index instrument680, a Reporting Bank 
must determine the JTD position for each constituent reference entity as the difference 
between –  
 
(a)  the value of the instrument, assuming that each reference entity of the 
instrument defaults independently with zero recovery; and  
 
(b)  the value of the instrument, assuming that none of the reference entities 
of the instrument default. 
 
8.2.165 
Subject to paragraph 8.2.166, for exposures in an equity investment in a fund 
that is treated as an unrated equity exposure and assigned to delta risk bucket 11 (Other 
sector) in accordance with paragraph 8.2.88(b), a Reporting Bank must treat the equity 
investment in the fund as an unrated equity instrument.   
 
8.2.166 
Despite paragraph 8.2.165, where the mandate of the fund allows the fund to 
invest in primarily high-yield or distressed instruments, the Reporting Bank must calculate 
the effective average risk weight of the fund assuming that the fund first invests, to the 
maximum possible extent allowed under the fund’s mandate, in instruments falling under 
the credit quality category attracting the highest risk weight, as set out in Table 8-14, and 
then progressively makes investments in instruments attracting lower risk weights in 
descending order until the total investment is reached.   
 
8.2.167 
A Reporting Bank must not recognise offsetting or diversification between the 
exposures assumed in accordance with paragraph 8.2.166, and other exposures. 
 
 
679  
This means that a Reporting Bank must not recognise diversification benefit between the DRC requirements 
across the components in paragraph 8.2.159.  
680  
For example, an index option. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-75 
 
Gross JTD for non-securitisations 
 
 
8.2.168 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the gross JTD position for each long or short 
exposure681. 
 
8.2.169 
A Reporting Bank must determine whether the direction of an exposure is long 
or short based on whether the instrument results in a loss or gain in the event of a default 
of the reference entity, regardless of the type of instrument creating the exposure. A 
Reporting Bank must treat an instrument that results in a loss for the Reporting Bank in 
the case of a default of the reference entity682 as a long exposure. A Reporting Bank must 
treat an instrument that results in a gain for the Reporting Bank in the case of a default 
of the reference entity as a short exposure.  
 
8.2.170 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the gross JTD position for each exposure, as 
follows: 
 
𝑱𝑻𝑫(𝒍𝒐𝒏𝒈) = 𝐦𝐚𝐱(𝑳𝑮𝑫× 𝒏𝒐𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒂𝒍+ 𝑷&𝑳, 𝟎) 
𝑱𝑻𝑫(𝒔𝒉𝒐𝒓𝒕) = 𝐦𝐢𝐧(𝑳𝑮𝑫× 𝒏𝒐𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒂𝒍+ 𝑷&𝑳, 𝟎) 
 
where – 
 
(a)  notional is the notional amount of an exposure, as defined in paragraph 
8.2.173; and 
 
(b)  P&L is the cumulative mark-to-market loss or gain that the Reporting Bank 
has already taken on the exposure. 
 
8.2.171 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.2.170, a Reporting Bank must assign LGD 
values as follows: 
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank must assign equity instruments and subordinated debt 
instruments an LGD value of 100%683; 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank must assign senior debt instruments an LGD value of 
75%; 
 
(c)  the Reporting Bank must assign covered bonds an LGD value of 25%. 
 
8.2.172 
 In calculating the gross JTD position as set out in paragraph 8.2.170, a 
Reporting Bank must record – 
 
(a)  the notional amount of an instrument that gives rise to a long (short) 
exposure as a positive (negative) value; and  
 
 
681  
For example, if the Reporting Bank has a long position on a bond issued by Apple, and another short 
position on a bond issued by Apple, the Reporting Bank must calculate 2 separate gross JTD positions. 
682  
For example, a seller of a put option on a bond has a long credit exposure, since a default of the bond 
results in a loss to the seller of the put option.  
683  
To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must assign exposures in an equity investment in a fund that is treated 
as an unrated equity exposure and assigned to delta risk bucket 11 (Other sector) in accordance with 
paragraph 8.2.88(b) an LGD value of 100%, consistent with the requirement in paragraph 8.2.165 to treat 
such exposures as an unrated equity instrument.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-76 
(b)  the P&L loss (gain) as a negative (positive) value. 
 
8.2.173 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.2.170(a), “notional amount of an exposure” in 
an instrument means the notional amount which the Reporting Bank uses to determine 
the loss of principal in the event of default684.   
 
8.2.174 
Despite paragraph 8.2.170, a Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
not multiply the notional by the LGD for an exposure in an instrument, 
where the market value of an instrument is not linked to the recovery rate 
of the reference entity685; and  
 
(b) 
set the gross JTD position as zero, if the contractual or legal terms of a 
derivative instrument allow for the unwinding of the derivative instrument 
with no exposure to default risk. 
 
8.2.175 
 For the purposes of paragraph 8.2.170(b), a Reporting Bank must include the 
P&L of the equity option embedded within a convertible bond when calculating the gross 
JTD position for an exposure in a convertible bond686. 
 
 
 
 
Net JTD for non-securitisations 
 
8.2.176 
To account for defaults within a one-year horizon, a Reporting Bank must weight 
the gross JTD position for an exposure with a residual maturity less than one year, by 
multiplying the gross JTD position of the exposure by the weighting factor mentioned in 
paragraph 8.2.177.   
 
8.2.177 
Subject to paragraph 8.2.179, the Reporting Bank must apply a weighting factor 
of the ratio of the exposure’s residual maturity relative to one year. To avoid doubt, the 
Reporting Bank must perform the weighting for gross JTD positions and not for net JTD 
positions. 
 
8.2.178 
A Reporting Bank must not weight the gross JTD position for an exposure with 
a residual maturity of one year or greater687.  
 
8.2.179 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.2.177, a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a)  for exposures with a residual maturity of less than 3 months, weight the 
gross JTD position by a minimum weighting factor of one-fourth688; 
 
 
684  
Annex 8A provides details on how the notional value of various instruments are calculated.  
685  
For example, a foreign exchange-credit hybrid option where there is an exchange of EUR coupons and USD 
coupons, together with a knockout feature that ends the exchange of cashflows in the event of a default of 
a particular bond issuer or equity issuer.  
686  
A convertible bond can be decomposed into a vanilla bond and a long equity option. As a result, treating a 
convertible bond as a vanilla bond when calculating its DRC requirement would potentially underestimate 
the JTD risk of the instrument. 
687  
For example, a Reporting Bank must weight the gross JTD position for an exposure with a 6 month residual 
maturity by one-half, while a Reporting Bank must not apply any weighting to the gross JTD position for 
an exposure with a one year residual maturity.  
688  
This is equivalent to the exposure having a residual maturity of 3 months.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-77 
(b) 
assign exposures to non-derivative equity instruments 689  a residual 
maturity of either more than one year or 3 months; and 
 
(c) 
for exposures to derivative instruments, use the residual maturity of the 
derivative instrument, rather than the maturity of the underlying 
instrument, to calculate the weighting to be applied to the gross JTD 
position690.  
 
8.2.180 
For the purposes of calculating the net JTD positions pursuant to paragraph 
8.2.161(b), a Reporting Bank may offset the maturity-weighted gross JTD positions of long 
and short exposures to the same reference entity, where the short exposure has the same 
or lower seniority relative to the long exposure691. 
 
8.2.181 
For the purposes of calculating the net JTD position pursuant to paragraph 
8.2.161(b), a Reporting Bank must treat the maturity-weighted gross JTD position as a 
maturity-weighted gross JTD position to the credit protection provider, in cases where the 
Reporting Bank has bought eligible credit protection from an eligible protection provider. 
 
8.2.182 
In the case where a total return swap is hedged by the underlying equity or 
bond, a Reporting Bank may fully offset the maturity-weighted gross JTD positions of the 
total return swap and the underlying equity or bond692 if the contractual and legal terms 
of the total return swap allow the Reporting Bank to unwind both the total return swap 
exposure and the exposure in the underlying equity or bond, at the time of expiry of the 
first exposure to mature, with no exposure to the default risk of the underlying equity or 
bond beyond the point of unwinding. 
 
 
 
Calculation of DRC requirement for non-securitisations 
 
8.2.183 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.2.161(c), a Reporting Bank must assign each 
net JTD position to one of the following buckets:  
 
(a)  companies; 
 
(b)  central governments, central banks and MDBs; 
 
(c)  PSEs. 
 
8.2.184 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the DRC requirement for each bucket as 
follows: 
 
 
689  
For example, shares. 
690  
For example, consider a hypothetical portfolio which contains an equity index futures with a residual 
maturity of one month and a negative market value of SGD 10 million, hedged with the underlying equity 
position with a positive market value of SGD 10 million.  The Reporting Bank must treat the equity index 
futures as having a residual maturity of 3 months, while the Reporting Bank may treat the position in the 
underlying equity as similarly having a residual maturity of 3 months.  The maturity-weighted gross JTD 
positions would be calculated as (1/4 x SGD -10 mil = SGD -2.5 mil) for the equity index future, and (1/4 
x SGD 10 mil = SGD 2.5 mil) for the position in the underlying equity.  
691  
For example, the Reporting Bank may offset a long exposure in a bond with a short exposure in an equity, 
but the Reporting Bank must not offset a long exposure in the equity with a short exposure in the bond. 
692  
This means that the net JTD of the 2 positions is zero.

(a) 
if an underlying reference entity has defaulted, a Reporting Bank must use 
the risk weight for the Defaulted credit quality category of 100%;  
 
(b)  subject to sub-paragraph (a), if an underlying reference entity has one or 
more external credit assessments by recognised ECAIs, the Reporting 
Bank must determine the credit quality of that reference entity in 
accordance with paragraph 7.3.30; and 
 
(c)  subject to sub-paragraph (a) and paragraph 8.2.186, if an underlying 
reference entity does not have an external credit assessment by a 
recognised ECAI, the Reporting Bank must use the risk weight for the 
Unrated credit quality category of 15%.  
 
8.2.186 
Despite paragraph 8.2.185(c), if an underlying reference entity does not have 
an external credit assessment by a recognised ECAI, where a Reporting Bank has obtained 
approval from the Authority to adopt the IRBA pursuant to Division 4 of Part VII, the 
Reporting Bank may, with the prior written approval of the Authority, internally rate the 
reference entity and map the internal rating under the IRBA to a credit quality grade set 
out in Table 7M-1. 
 
8.2.187 
 A Reporting Bank must calculate the DRC requirement for non-securitisations 
as the sum of the bucket level DRC requirements calculated pursuant to paragraph 8.2.184. 
 
 
 
Gross JTD for securitisations (non-CTP) 
 
8.2.188 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the gross JTD position for each long or short 
exposure.  A Reporting Bank must determine whether the direction of the exposure is long 
or short in accordance with paragraph 8.2.169693.  
 
8.2.189 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the gross JTD position of each exposure as the 
market value of the exposure.  
 
 
693  
For example, the Reporting Bank has a long securitisation exposure if it incurs losses in the event of a 
default in the securitised portfolio.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore

 Net JTD for securitisations (non-CTP) 
 
8.2.190 
A Reporting Bank must apply the maturity-weighting in accordance with 
paragraphs 8.2.176 to 8.2.179 to the gross JTD positions arising from exposures in the 
securitisations (non-CTP) component.  
 
8.2.191 
A Reporting Bank must not offset –  
 
(a)  securitisation (non-CTP) exposures with different underlying securitised 
asset pools, even if the attachment and detachment points are the same; 
and 
 
(b)  securitisation (non-CTP) exposures arising from different tranches with 
the same securitised asset pool. 
 
8.2.192 
A Reporting Bank may – 
 
(a)  offset the maturity-weighted gross JTD positions of securitisation (non-
CTP) exposures, arising from the same tranches with the same underlying 
securitised asset pools, but with different maturities; and 
 
(b)  offset the maturity-weighted gross JTD positions of the exposures in the 
following cases: 
 
(i)  
where long (short) positions in a set of securitisation tranches are 
combined to perfectly replicate a short (long) tranche of a 
securitisation with the same underlying securitised asset pool694; 
 
(ii)  where long (short) positions in a set of securitisation exposures with 
different underlying securitised asset pools are combined to perfectly 
replicate a short (long) securitisation exposure; 
 
(iii) where a set of long (short) non-securitisation positions in individual 
names or a non-tranched index are combined to perfectly replicate a 
short (long) securitisation exposure695.    
 
8.2.193 
Where a Reporting Bank offsets non-securitisation positions in individual names 
or a non-tranched index pursuant to paragraph 8.2.192(b)(iii), the Reporting Bank must 
exclude the non-securitisation positions from the non-securitisations component.  
 
 
 
Calculation of DRC requirement for securitisations (non-CTP) 
 
8.2.194 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.2.161(c), a Reporting Bank must assign each 
net JTD position to one of the following buckets based on the asset class and region of the 
underlying securitised asset pool: 
 
 
694  
For example, the Reporting Bank may also offset securitisation exposures if a collection of long 
securitisation exposures is perfectly replicated by a collection of short securitisation exposures.  
695  
In other words, the Reporting Bank decomposes the non-securitisation positions in individual names, or in 
a non-tranched index, proportionately into securitisation tranches that span the entire tranche structure of 
the securitisation exposure, and perfectly replicate the securitisation exposure.

8.2.195 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.2.194, a Reporting Bank must rely on a 
classification that is commonly used in the market for assigning securitisation exposures 
based on asset class and region of the underlying. The Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a)  assign each securitisation (non-CTP) exposure to only one of the buckets 
defined in paragraph 8.2.194 and the Reporting Bank must assign all 
securitisations with the same asset class and region of underlying to the 
same bucket; and 
 
(b)  assign any securitisation (non-CTP) exposure that it is unable to assign 
based on the asset class and region of the underlying to the “Others” 
bucket. 
 
8.2.196 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the DRC requirement for each bucket as 
follows: 
 
𝑫𝑹𝑪𝒃= 𝒎𝒂𝒙[( ∑𝑹𝑾𝒊. 𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒊
𝒊∈𝑳𝒐𝒏𝒈
) −𝑯𝑩𝑹. ( ∑
𝑹𝑾𝒊. |𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒊|
𝒊∈𝑺𝒉𝒐𝒓𝒕
) ; 𝟎] 
 
 
where –  
 
(a)  i refers to a securitisation (non-CTP) exposure assigned to bucket b; 
 
(b)  𝑹𝑾𝒊 refers to the risk weight for securitisation (non-CTP) exposure i.  To 
determine the 𝑹𝑾𝒊 to be applied, the Reporting Bank must –  
 
(i)  
set the risk weight for the securitisation (non-CTP) exposure as the 
risk weight that would apply to the securitisation (non-CTP) exposure 
if the Reporting Bank were to hold it in the banking book, as 
determined by paragraph 7.1.14(b)(iii), in accordance with the 
hierarchy of approaches determined by paragraphs 7.6.13 to 7.6.19, 
divided by 12.5, except that the Reporting Bank must assume a 
tranche maturity of one year for the securitisation (non-CTP) 
exposure; and 
 
(ii)  cap the DRC requirement for an individual non-derivative 
securitisation (non-CTP) exposure at the fair value of the exposure; 
and 
  
(c)  HBR is the hedge benefit ratio which is calculated as follows: 
 
𝑯𝑩𝑹=
∑𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒍𝒐𝒏𝒈
∑𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒍𝒐𝒏𝒈+ ∑|𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒔𝒉𝒐𝒓𝒕| 
 
where – 
 
(i)  
∑𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒍𝒐𝒏𝒈 is the sum of the net long, non risk-weighted JTD 
positions assigned to bucket b; and 
 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-83 
(ii)  ∑|𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒔𝒉𝒐𝒓𝒕| is the sum of the absolute value of the net short, non 
risk-weighted JTD positions assigned to bucket b. 
 
8.2.197 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the DRC requirement for securitisations (non-
CTP) as a sum of the bucket level DRC requirements calculated pursuant to paragraph 
8.2.196. 
 
 
 
Gross JTD for securitisations (CTP)  
 
8.2.198 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the gross JTD position for each individual 
exposure.  A Reporting Bank must determine whether the direction of the exposure is long 
or short in accordance with paragraph 8.2.169. 
 
8.2.199 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the gross JTD position as the market value of 
the exposure for –  
 
(a)  a securitisation exposure in a CTP; and  
 
(b)  an exposure that is not a securitisation exposure and that hedges 
securitisation exposures in a CTP.  
 
8.2.200 
A Reporting Bank must treat Nth-to-default instruments in a CTP as 
securitisation exposures with attachment and detachment points as defined below, where 
“Total names” is the total number of names in the underlying basket or pool: 
 
(a)  attachment point = (N – 1) / Total names; 
 
(b)  detachment point = N / Total names. 
 
 
 
Net JTD for securitisations (CTP) 
 
8.2.201 
A Reporting Bank must apply the maturity-weighting in accordance with 
paragraphs 8.2.176 to 8.2.179 to the gross JTD positions arising from exposures in the 
securitisations (CTP) component. 
 
8.2.202 
A Reporting Bank may –  
 
(a)  for index securitisation exposures, offset the maturity-weighted gross JTD 
positions for securitisation exposures to the same index family696, series697 
and tranche698, across maturities; 
 
 
696  
For example, CDX.NA.IG. 
697  
For example, series 18. 
698  
For example, the (0% - 3%) tranche. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-84 
(b)  for index securitisation exposures and non-securitisation exposures, in an 
index in the same index family and series, offset the maturity-weighted 
gross JTD positions in the following cases699:  
 
(i) 
where long (short) positions in a set of individual index securitisation 
tranches are combined to replicate a short (long) securitisation 
tranche, of the same index family and series;   
 
(ii) 
where long (short) positions in a set of individual index securitisation 
tranches are combined to replicate a short (long) non-securitisation 
exposure, in the same index family and series; and   
 
(c)  provided the conditions in paragraph 8.2.203 are met, for securitisation 
exposures and non-securitisation exposures, referencing an index or 
single name constituents of the index –  
 
(i) 
where long (short) positions in a set of single name securitisation 
exposures are combined to perfectly replicate a short (long) 
securitisation exposure in an index, offset the maturity-weighted 
gross JTD positions of the long (short) positions in the set of single 
name securitisation exposures against the maturity-weighted gross 
JTD position of the short (long) securitisation exposure in the index;  
 
(ii) 
where long (short) positions in a set of single name non-
securitisation exposures are combined to perfectly replicate a short 
(long) securitisation exposure in an index, offset the maturity-
weighted gross JTD positions of the long (short) positions in the set 
of single name non-securitisation exposures against the maturity-
weighted gross JTD position of the short (long) securitisation 
exposure in the index; and 
 
(iii) where perfect replication in accordance with sub-paragraph (c)(i) is 
not possible, and the long (short) positions in a set of single name 
securitisation exposures are combined to replicate a short (long) 
securitisation exposure in an index with a residual component, offset 
the maturity-weighted gross JTD positions of the long (short) 
positions  in the set of single name securitisation exposures against 
the maturity-weighted gross JTD position of the short (long) 
securitisation exposure in the index, provided that the Reporting 
Bank reflects the residual maturity-weighted gross JTD position as 
the net JTD position700. 
 
8.2.203 
For the purposes of applying the offsetting pursuant to paragraph 8.2.202(c), 
a Reporting Bank must –  
 
699  
For example, a long securitisation exposure in a 10% – 15% tranche can be offset by combined short 
securitisation exposures in the 10% – 12% and 12% – 15% tranches on the same index and series.  
Similarly, long securitisation exposures in the various tranches that, when combined, replicate an exposure 
in the index series (non-tranched) can be offset against a short securitisation exposure in the index series 
if all the exposures are to the same index and series.   
700  
For example, a long securitisation exposure in an index of 125 names and short securitisation exposures 
of the exact replicating amounts in 124 of the names would result in a net long securitisation exposure in 
the missing 125th name of the index.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-85 
 
(a) 
determine the JTD position of each of the single name exposures in the 
securitisation exposure, based on the difference between – 
 
(i) 
the value of the securitisation exposure, assuming that each single 
name exposure defaults independently with zero recovery; and  
 
(ii) 
the value of the securitisation exposure, assuming no single name 
exposure defaults; 
 
(b) 
ensure that the sum of the values of the decomposed single name 
exposures is equal to the undecomposed value of the securitisation 
exposure701; and 
 
(c)  apply the offsetting only for vanilla securitisation exposures702. 
 
8.2.204 
A Reporting Bank must not offset the maturity-weighted gross JTD positions for 
any of the following:  
 
a) 
different tranches of the same index or series; 
  
b) 
different series of the same index;  
 
c) 
different index families. 
 
 
 
Calculation of DRC requirement for securitisations (CTP) 
 
8.2.205 
For the calculation of the DRC requirement for the securitisations (CTP) 
component, a Reporting Bank must define each index as a separate bucket703.   
 
8.2.206 
A Reporting Bank must assign each net JTD position arising from exposures in 
a CTP, including a bespoke securitisation exposure in a CTP, to a bucket corresponding to 
the index that is the reference instrument of the CTP704.  
 
8.2.207 A Reporting Bank must apply the risk weights to each net JTD position as follows: 
 
(a)  for a securitisation exposure in a CTP, the Reporting Bank must apply the 
risk weight in accordance with paragraph 8.2.196(b);  
 
 
701  
The Reporting Bank may perform the decomposition using a valuation model, where a single name 
equivalent constituent of a securitisation exposure is valued as the difference between the unconditional 
value of a securitisation exposure and the conditional value of the securitisation exposure, assuming that 
the single name defaults with zero recovery.  
702  
To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank is not allowed to offset the maturity-weighted gross JTD positions of 
exotic securitisation exposures pursuant to paragraph 8.2.202(c). Examples of exotic securitisation 
exposures are CDO squared securitisation instruments. 
703  
A non-exhaustive list of indices include: CDX NA.IG, iTraxx Europe IG, CDX HY, iTraxx XO, LCDX (loan 
index), iTraxx LevX (loan index), Asia Corp, Latin America Corp, Other Regions Corp, Major Sovereign (G7 
and Western Europe) and Other Sovereign. 
704  
To avoid doubt, exposures in a CTP assigned to a bucket encompasses all exposures arising from the CTP 
relating to an index, which comprises securitisation exposures, non-securitisation exposures that hedge the 
securitisation exposures in the CTP, and single-name exposures that replicate the index.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-86 
(b)  for an exposure that is not a securitisation exposure and that hedges 
securitisation exposures in a CTP, the Reporting Bank must apply the risk 
weights referred to in paragraph 8.2.184(b). 
 
8.2.208 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the DRC requirement for each bucket (i.e. for 
each index) as follows: 
 
𝑫𝑹𝑪𝒃= ( ∑𝑹𝑾𝒊. 𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒊
𝒊∈𝑳𝒐𝒏𝒈
) −𝑯𝑩𝑹𝒄𝒕𝒑( ∑
𝑹𝑾𝒊. |𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒊|
𝒊∈𝑺𝒉𝒐𝒓𝒕
) 
 
where –  
 
(a)  i refers to an exposure belonging to bucket b; 
 
(b)  𝑹𝑾𝒊 refers to the risk weight that is to be applied in accordance with 
paragraph 8.2.207; and 
 
(c)  𝑯𝑩𝑹𝒄𝒕𝒑 is the hedge benefit ratio which is calculated as follows: 
 
𝑯𝑩𝑹𝒄𝒕𝒑=
∑𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒍𝒐𝒏𝒈
∑𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒍𝒐𝒏𝒈+ ∑|𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒔𝒉𝒐𝒓𝒕| 
 
where –  
 
(i)  
∑𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒍𝒐𝒏𝒈 is the sum of the net long, non risk-weighted JTD 
positions, where the summation is across all buckets (i.e. not only 
the long exposures within the bucket); and 
 
(ii)  ∑|𝒏𝒆𝒕⁡𝑱𝑻𝑫𝒔𝒉𝒐𝒓𝒕| is the sum of the absolute value of the net short, non 
risk-weighted JTD positions, where the summation is across all 
buckets (i.e. not only the short exposures within the bucket). 
 
8.2.209 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the DRC requirement for securitisations (CTP) 
by705 –  
 
(a)  for each bucket, calculating the contribution to the DRC requirement for 
securitisations (CTP) as follows:  
 
𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒃𝒖𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏⁡𝒕𝒐⁡𝐃𝐑𝐂⁡𝐫𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝒃=⁡(𝒎𝒂𝒙[𝑫𝑹𝑪𝒃, 𝟎] + 𝟎. 𝟓× 𝒎𝒊𝒏[𝑫𝑹𝑪𝒃, 𝟎]) 
 
(b)  aggregating the bucket level contributions to DRC requirements as follows: 
 
𝑫𝑹𝑪𝑪𝑻𝑷= 𝒎𝒂𝒙[∑𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒃𝒖𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏⁡𝒕𝒐⁡𝐃𝐑𝐂⁡𝐫𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝒃, 𝟎
𝒃
] 
 
 
705  
For example, if the DRC requirement for the index CDX North America IG is +100 and the DRC requirement 
for the index Major Sovereign (G7 and Western Europe) is -100, the total DRC requirement for the CTP is 
100 – 0.5 x 100 = 50.  The procedure for the DRCb and DRCCTP terms accounts for the basis risk in cross 
index hedges as the hedge benefit from the cross-index short positions is discounted twice, first by the 
hedge benefit ratio in DRCb and again by the term 0.5 in the Contribution to DRC requirementb equation.

Sub-division 10: Residual Risk Add-on (RRAO) 
  
 
Instruments subject to the RRAO 
 
8.2.210 
A Reporting Bank must subject all of the following instruments to the RRAO: 
 
(a)  instruments with an exotic underlying. Instruments with an exotic 
underlying are instruments in the trading book with an underlying 
exposure that is not within the scope of delta, vega and curvature risk 
treatment in any risk class under the SBM set out in Sub-division 2 of this 
Division and of the DRC requirements set out in paragraph 8.2.158706; 
 
(b)  instruments bearing other residual risks, which are instruments that meet 
any of the following criteria707:  
 
(i)  
instruments subject to vega or curvature risk capital requirements in 
the trading book and with pay-offs that cannot be written or perfectly 
replicated as a finite linear combination of vanilla options with a 
single underlying equity price, commodity price, exchange rate, bond 
price, credit default swap or interest rate swap;  
 
(ii)  instruments which fall under a CTP as defined in Part II, except for 
instruments that are not securitisation exposures and that hedge the 
securitisation exposures in the CTP; 
 
(c)  instruments with embedded prepayment options (including securitisation 
exposures where the assets underlying the securitisation exposure have 
embedded prepayment options), where the embedded prepayment option 
is a behavioural option; 
 
(d) 
options that do not have a maturity;  
 
(e)  options that do not have a strike price and do not have a barrier; 
 
(f) 
options that have multiple strike prices or barriers.  
 
8.2.211 
A Reporting Bank must reflect behavioural patterns in the pricing model of 
instruments with embedded behavioural options, referred to in paragraph 8.2.210(c). 
 
 
706  
Examples of exotic underlying exposures are longevity risk, weather, natural disasters and future realised 
volatility.  
707  
Examples of other residual risk types and instruments that may fall within paragraph 8.2.210(b) are – 
(a)  gap risk: risk of a significant change in vega parameters in options due to small movements in the 
underlying, which results in hedge slippage.  Relevant instruments subject to gap risk include all path 
dependent options, such as barrier options, Asian options, digital options and bonds with multiple call 
dates; 
(b)  correlation risk: risk of a change in a correlation parameter necessary for determining the value of an 
instrument with multiple underlyings. Relevant instruments subject to correlation risk include all 
basket options, best-of-options, spread options, basis options, Bermudan options and quanto options; 
and 
(c)  behavioural risk: risk of a change in exercise or prepayment outcomes such as those that arise in 
fixed rate mortgage products where retail clients may make decisions motivated by factors other than 
pure financial gain (such as demographical features or other social factors). A callable bond may have 
behavioural risk if the right to call lies with a retail client.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-88 
8.2.212 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must not consider an instrument as falling 
within the scope of paragraph 8.2.210 and subject the instrument to the RRAO, only 
because the instrument is subject to one or more of the following risk types:  
 
(a)  risk from a cheapest-to-deliver option; 
 
(b)  smile risk: the risk of a change in an implied volatility parameter used for 
determining the value of an instrument with optionality, relative to the 
implied volatility of other instruments with optionality with the same 
underlying and maturity but different moneyness; 
 
(c)  correlation risk arising from multi-underlying instruments that are 
European or American plain vanilla options, or from any options that can 
be written as a linear combination of multi-underlying instruments that 
are European and American plain vanilla options; 
 
(d)  dividend risk arising from a derivative instrument whose underlying does 
not consist solely of dividend payments. 
 
8.2.213  To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must subject index instruments and multi-
underlying instruments that are options to the RRAO if they fall within the scope of 
paragraph 8.2.210. For funds that are subject to the treatment specified in paragraph 
8.2.88(b) (i.e. treated as an unrated “Other sector” equity), the Reporting Bank must 
assume the fund is exposed to exotic underlying exposures or to other residual risks, to 
the maximum possible extent allowed under the fund’s mandate. 
 
8.2.214 
Despite paragraph 8.2.210, a Reporting Bank must not subject a position in an 
instrument that is matched with an equal but opposite position in the same instrument 
from a transaction with an external party (i.e. a back-to-back transaction) to the RRAO.  
In such cases, the Reporting Bank must exclude the positions in the instrument from the 
RRAO708.    
 
8.2.215 
Despite paragraph 8.2.210(b), a Reporting Bank must exclude any instrument 
that is listed or eligible for central clearing, or both, from the RRAO. To avoid doubt, a 
Reporting Bank must subject any instrument with an exotic underlying to the RRAO even 
if it is listed or eligible for central clearing, or both. 
 
 
 
Calculation of the RRAO 
  
8.2.216 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the scope of instruments that are subject 
to RRAO does not change the scope of risk factors subject to the delta risk, vega risk, 
curvature risk under the SBM, or DRC requirements. 
 
8.2.217 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the capital requirement for RRAO as the sum 
of the gross notional amount multiplied by the following risk weights, for all instruments 
bearing residual risk: 
 
 
708  
For example, in cases where a dividend swap is used to hedge dividend risks or where a total return swap 
is used to hedge the underlying product, the Reporting Bank can only exclude the dividend swap and total 
return swap from RRAO only if there is an equal and opposite exposure in the same dividend swap or the 
total return swap.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-89 
(a)  for instruments with an exotic underlying as specified in paragraph 
8.2.210(a), 1.0%; 
 
(b)  instruments referred to in paragraph 8.2.210(b) to (f), 0.1%. 
 
8.2.218 
Where the Authority is of the view that the RRAO is not sufficient to address 
the risk arising from an instrument, the Authority may impose additional capital 
requirements under Part X.

Division 3: IMA 
 
Sub-division 1: General Requirements and Application Process to Adopt the IMA 
 
8.3.1 
A Reporting Bank must comply with the requirements in Sub-division 6 of 
Division 1 of this Part, and in this Division, before applying for approval from the Authority 
to adopt the IMA709.  
 
8.3.2 
A Reporting Bank must perform an internal assessment against the 
requirements and guidance set out in the footnotes in Sub-division 6 of Division 1 of this 
Part, and in this Division, to ascertain its readiness to adopt the IMA, before applying for 
approval from the Authority.  
 
 
 
Application to Adopt the IMA 
 
8.3.3 
A Reporting Bank that intends to adopt the IMA to calculate its market risk 
capital requirements must apply in writing to the Authority for approval.  
 
8.3.4 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank which complies with the requirements in this 
Division does not automatically qualify for IMA adoption.710 In considering whether the 
approval mentioned in paragraph 8.3.3 should be granted to a Reporting Bank, the 
Authority – 
 
(a)  has to be satisfied that the intention of the Reporting Bank in adopting the 
IMA is to seek continual improvements in its risk management practices; 
and 
 
(b) 
will consider the willingness and ability of the Reporting Bank to maintain 
and improve its systems to ensure the continuing appropriateness of the 
market risk capital requirements. 
 
8.3.5 
 A Reporting Bank that has received approval from the Authority to use the IMA 
to calculate its market risk capital requirements for one or more trading desks must comply 
with the requirements in Sub-division 6 of Division 1 of this Part, this Division and with 
paragraph 8.3.9(a) to (g) on an ongoing basis711. 
 
8.3.6 
A Reporting Bank must, in its application to adopt the IMA pursuant to 
paragraph 8.3.3, nominate each trading desk, defined by a Reporting Bank under 
paragraphs 8.1.62 to 8.1.69, to be either –  
 
(a) 
in-scope for approval to adopt the IMA (i.e. the Reporting Bank intends to 
calculate market risk capital requirements for the trading desk using the 
IMA); or 
 
 
709  
A Reporting Bank should also meet the guidance set out in the footnotes in Sub-division 6 of Division 1 of 
this Part, and in this Division, before applying for approval from the Authority to adopt the IMA.  
710  
The Reporting Bank should not regard the requirements in this Division as an exhaustive checklist of 
requirements to be satisfied in order to adopt the IMA.  
711  
A Reporting Bank that has received approval from the Authority to use the IMA to calculate its market risk 
capital requirements for one or more trading desks should meet the guidance set out in the footnotes in 
Sub-division 6 of Division 1 of this Part, and in this Division, on an ongoing basis.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore

(b) 
out-of-scope of the IMA (i.e. the Reporting Bank intends to calculate 
market risk capital requirements for the trading desk using the SA(MR)). 
 
The Reporting Bank must specify in writing in its application a basis for the nomination of 
each trading desk. The Reporting Bank must not nominate a trading desk to be out-of-
scope of the IMA for the sole reason that market risk capital requirements for the trading 
desk determined using the SA(MR) are lower than that determined using the IMA. 
 
8.3.7 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the application to adopt the IMA pursuant 
to paragraph 8.3.3 contains all of the following:

requirement, calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.3.243, that is 
based on positions held in trading desks that meet the requirements in 
paragraph 8.3.17(b) and (c), is more than or equal to 10%. 
 
8.3.10  
For trading desks which the Reporting Bank had nominated to be out-of-scope 
of the IMA in an IMA application pursuant to paragraph 8.3.6, a Reporting Bank must use 
the SA(MR) to calculate market risk capital requirements for those trading desks for a 
period of at least one year, from the date of the Authority’s approval, or rejection, of that 
IMA application by the Reporting Bank.  
 
8.3.11 
The Authority may require a period of monitoring and live testing of a Reporting 
Bank’s IMA framework, including the monitoring and testing of the Reporting Bank’s 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-93 
internal models712 used for the purposes of calculating market risk capital requirements, 
prior to granting the approval in paragraph 8.3.9. 
 
8.3.12 
A Reporting Bank that has received approval to use the IMA to calculate its 
market risk capital requirements for a trading desk must not revert to calculating the 
market risk capital requirements for that trading desk using the SA(MR) or SSA(MR), 
unless directed by the Authority to do so. 
 
8.3.13 
If a Reporting Bank becomes aware, after adopting the IMA for a trading desk, 
that any of the confirmations made pursuant to paragraph 8.3.7(a) or (b) are no longer 
valid, it no longer meets the requirement in paragraph 8.3.5, or that it no longer complies 
with any of the conditions or restrictions imposed by the Authority pursuant to paragraph 
8.3.9, it must –  
 
(a) 
inform the Authority in writing as soon as practicable and, in any case, no 
later than 5 business days of the Reporting Bank becoming aware, of the 
invalidity of any confirmation, failure to meet the requirement, or any non-
compliance with the conditions or restrictions, as the case may be; 
 
(b) 
assess the effect of the invalidity of the confirmation(s), failure to meet 
the requirement, or non-compliance with the conditions or restrictions, as 
the case may be, in terms of the risk(s) posed to the Reporting Bank (if 
any); 
 
(c) 
prepare a plan to rectify the issues that led to the invalidity of the 
confirmation(s), failure to meet the requirement, or non-compliance with 
the conditions or restrictions, as the case may be, and inform the Authority 
of its plan (including its target completion date for the plan) as soon as 
practicable; and  
 
(d) 
undertake prompt corrective action within a reasonable time in accordance 
with the plan prepared pursuant to sub-paragraph (c). 
 
8.3.14 
The Authority may – 
 
(a) 
suspend or revoke its approval for a Reporting Bank to adopt the IMA; 
 
(b)  subject a Reporting Bank to higher capital requirements pursuant to 
section 10(3) of the Banking Act; or  
 
(c) 
take any other actions,  
 
if –  
 
 
712  
To avoid doubt, internal models include market risk management models, and models for the calculation 
of market risk capital requirements comprising ES models, SES models and DRC requirement models, used 
by a Reporting Bank. Market risk management models are used by the Reporting Bank for risk management 
purposes, and include trading desk risk management models used by trading desks which are in-scope of 
the IMA. Trading desk risk management models are based on the methodologies used in the Reporting 
Bank’s risk management models used for internal risk management purposes but can differ in aspects such 
as risk factor identification, parameter estimation and proxy concepts, so as to meet the requirements 
specified in this Sub-division.    


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-94 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank has not fulfilled any of the conditions or restrictions 
imposed by the Authority pursuant to paragraph 8.3.9; 
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank fails to comply with paragraph 8.3.13; 
 
(iii) the Authority subsequently becomes aware that the Reporting Bank has 
furnished information that is false or misleading in a material manner to 
the Authority in connection with its application for approval to adopt the 
IMA; or 
 
(iv) the Authority is not satisfied that the Reporting Bank is in compliance with 
the requirements in this Division, or that the risk management process 
and system of the Reporting Bank are adequate to support the IMA. 
 
8.3.15 
A Reporting Bank must seek the approval of the Authority before it makes any 
significant change to its IMA framework (including its internal models) for market risk. 
Prior to receiving approval for any significant change to its internal models, the Reporting 
Bank must continue to use its existing internal models to calculate its market risk capital 
requirements for the affected exposures, unless required by the Authority to use the 
SA(MR). 
 
 
 
Scope of IMA 
 
8.3.16 
A Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a)  use the IMA to calculate market risk capital requirements only for positions 
held in trading desks that are in-scope of the IMA; and 
 
(b)  ensure that its internal models address all positions held in trading desks 
that are in-scope of the IMA. 
 
8.3.17 
A Reporting Bank must treat a trading desk as being in-scope of the IMA only 
if – 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank has obtained the Authority’s approval for the use of 
its internal models, including the DRC requirement model in cases where 
the trading desk has exposure to issuer default risk, in respect of the 
trading desk; 
 
(b) 
the trading desk satisfies the backtesting requirements at both the IMA 
portfolio level and at the trading desk level in accordance with paragraphs 
8.3.149 to 8.3.162; and 
 
(c) 
the trading desk satisfies the PLA test at the trading desk level as specified 
in paragraphs 8.3.165 to 8.3.180, meaning that the trading desk is 
assigned to the green or amber zone by the Reporting Bank in accordance 
with paragraph 8.3.175. 
 
8.3.18 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must treat a trading desk that is not in-scope 
of the IMA as being out-of-scope of the IMA.  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-95 
8.3.19 
The Reporting Bank must conduct the PLA test and backtesting on a quarterly 
basis to determine – 
 
(a)  if the trading desk is eligible to be in-scope of the IMA in accordance with 
paragraph 8.3.17; and  
 
(b)  the classification of the trading desk under the PLA test in accordance with 
paragraph 8.3.175. 
 
8.3.20 
A Reporting Bank must not assign any securitisation position to a trading desk 
that is in-scope of the IMA. The Reporting Bank must assign a securitisation position to a 
trading desk that is out-of-scope of the IMA, and may assign a position in an instrument 
hedging the securitisation position to the same trading desk. 
 
8.3.21 
A Reporting Bank must assess the proportion of the Reporting Bank’s 
aggregated market risk capital requirement (as calculated in accordance with paragraph 
8.3.243) that is based on positions held in trading desks that are in-scope of the IMA, on 
a quarterly basis. If this proportion is less than 10% for the Reporting Bank, the Reporting 
Bank must not use the IMA for calculating its market risk capital requirements for that 
quarter and on an ongoing basis thereafter, until the Reporting Bank reapplies for and is 
granted approval from the Authority to use the IMA for the purposes of calculating its 
market risk capital requirements.  
 
 
Sub-division 2: Qualitative Standards

Bank must ensure that senior management keeps the Board apprised on a regular basis 
of the market risk exposures and transactions of the Reporting Bank which have a 
significant impact on market risk. 
 
8.3.23 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board has ultimate responsibility for the 
continuing effectiveness of the market risk management process and system, and stress 
tests, and that sufficient resources are devoted to the market risk control function. The 
Board may delegate some of its market risk management responsibilities to senior 
management or to staff, or committees comprising senior management or staff. However, 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that accountability of the Board is not delegated and that 
the Board continues to exercise oversight of its delegated responsibilities. 
 
8.3.24 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management exercises active 
oversight exceeding the level of involvement by the Board to ensure the continuing 
effectiveness of the market risk management process and system, and stress tests, and

The Reporting Bank should ensure that the Board ensures that there is adequate representation from 
independent risk management units on committees responsible for decisions which may impact the market 
risk of the Reporting Bank. These committees should have written terms of reference with clearly defined 
objectives, roles and responsibilities. 
715  
This is part of the checks and balances embodied in sound corporate governance.  
716  
The Reporting Bank should ensure that senior management articulates its expectations and provides 
guidance on technical and operational aspects of the market risk management process and system. 
717  
The Reporting Bank should ensure that such review takes into account changes in the activities of the 
Reporting Bank and market conditions.

Risk Management Process and System - Assessment Process for New 
 
Instruments 
 
8.3.47 
A Reporting Bank must have a policy to ensure that every new instrument that 
it takes a position in is assessed minimally against the criteria set out in paragraphs 8.3.48 
and 8.3.49. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the policy clearly explains what is to be 
considered a new instrument for which an assessment before taking a position in the 
instrument is necessary. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the policy also identifies a 
functional unit independent of the market risk-taking units to be accountable for the 
approval process for a new instrument. 
 
8.3.48

of authority in the relevant areas720 to proceed with taking a position in 
the proposed instrument. 
 
8.3.50 
A Reporting Bank must conduct a post-implementation review of a new 
instrument at an appropriate time after its introduction. The Reporting Bank must also 
perform periodic reviews of approved product proposals to ensure their continued 
relevance. The Reporting Bank must document these reviews and take appropriate steps 
to address any issues that arise from such reviews. 
 
 
 
Risk Management Process and System – Risk Identification  
 
8.3.51 
A Reporting Bank must have a policy in place to ensure that all market risks are 
identified and understood before the Reporting Bank undertakes the market risks. The 
Reporting Bank must establish procedures to identify all market risks arising from all its 
business activities. 
 
8.3.52 
A Reporting Bank must take into consideration the risk-return relationship of its 
business activities in deciding on its market risk threshold and the types of business 
activities to engage in. 
 
8.3.53 
Once a Reporting Bank has determined its market risk threshold, it must 
develop a trading strategy to align its business goals with the market risks that it is 
prepared to undertake. The Reporting Bank must review the risk-return relationship of its 
business activities regularly and evaluate whether its trading strategy needs to be adjusted 
based on changes in its business goals and in market conditions721. The Reporting Bank 
must document these evaluations and adjust the trading strategy if it deems it necessary 
to do so.  
 
 
 
 
720  
For example, risk management, operations, accounting, legal or compliance. 
721  
The Reporting Bank should ensure that the Board and senior management actively participate in such 
reviews.

the market risk management model is disclosed by the third-party vendor, where the 
market risk management model is not developed by the Reporting Bank. 
 
8.3.58 
A Reporting Bank must not rely on the use of a market risk management model 
obtained from a third-party vendor (“vendor model”) that claims proprietary technology 
as a justification for exemption from any documentation or other requirement relating to 
its use of the IMA. The Reporting Bank must, where necessary, rely more heavily on 
alternative validation techniques or methods designed to compensate for the lack of access 
to full information. Where vendor models are used, the Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
document and explain the role of the vendor model and the extent to 
which it is used within the market risk management process and system 
of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(b) 
demonstrate a thorough understanding of the vendor model; 
 
(c) 
ensure that the vendor model is appropriate for measuring the market risk 
of the Reporting Bank723; and 
 
(d) 
have clearly described strategies for regularly reviewing the performance 
of the vendor model. 
 
8.3.59 
In cases where market risks are not adequately captured in its market risk 
management model, a Reporting Bank must make appropriate adjustments to its risk 
measurement or set aside reserves to incorporate those risks. 
 
 
722  
The Reporting Bank should ensure that the market risk management model is able to easily accommodate 
volume increases, new valuation methodologies and new instruments. In particular, the computer systems 
used should be capable of handling the volume of transactions and the complexity of market risks assumed. 
The Reporting Bank should also consider the ease with which processing and other software errors can be 
corrected. As model development and implementation is a complex process, the Reporting Bank should 
ensure that its staff and, where applicable, its vendors and consultants have the requisite skills to manage 
the inherent complexity involved. 
723  
For example, the Reporting Bank should ensure that the vendor model can measure all identified market 
risks arising from instruments for which the vendor model is used.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-102 
8.3.60 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and senior management 
understand the basis of the internal models used by the Reporting Bank, including their 
major assumptions, strengths and limitations.  
 
 
 
Model Validation 
 
8.3.61 
A Reporting Bank must have policies and processes in place to ensure that its 
internal models are validated by suitably qualified parties independent of the development 
process to ensure that they are robust, conceptually sound and adequately capture all 
market risks. 
 
8.3.62 
 A Reporting Bank must conduct a model validation when an internal model is 
initially developed and when any significant change is made to the internal model. The 
Reporting Bank must validate all internal models at least annually, and where there are 
structural changes in the market or changes to the composition of portfolios, which might 
lead to the internal models no longer being adequate to capture the market risks of the 
Reporting Bank. Where necessary, the Reporting Bank must recalibrate the internal 
models. The Reporting Bank must take into account academic and market developments 
as part of its model review process. The Reporting Bank must ensure that significant issues 
are escalated to senior management and promptly addressed. 
 
8.3.63 
Where a Reporting Bank has outsourced its validation function to an external 
party, it must have qualified staff independent of the development process to assess the 
quality of the work done by the external party in validating the internal models. The 
Reporting Bank must be ultimately responsible for all model validation work.  
 
8.3.64 
A Reporting Bank must have sound model validation policies which include all 
of the following elements:  
 
(a) 
on the model approval process, the Reporting Bank must ensure that – 
 
(i) 
there is a centralised unit responsible for model validation and this 
unit comprises staff with the necessary experience and expertise; 
 
(ii) 
responsibilities of the centralised unit mentioned in sub-paragraph 
(a)(i) include ensuring that the current systems setup is capable of 
supporting the internal models; 
 
(iii) all changes made to the internal models being used, or to the 
modelling process, are validated by the centralised unit mentioned 
in sub-paragraph (a)(i); 
 
(iv) the Reporting Bank maintains previous versions of the internal 
models being altered; and 
 
(v) 
internal models are subject to change-control procedures, so that 
computer codes cannot be changed except by authorised staff; 
 
(b) 
on definition of responsibilities, the Reporting Bank must ensure that – 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-103 
(i) 
the responsibilities for model construction and model validation are 
clearly and formally defined;  
 
(ii) 
the staff performing model validation are independent of the staff 
who construct the internal model, and there is no conflict of interest 
and that the staff performing the validation work can provide 
objective and effective challenge to the staff who construct the model; 
and  
 
(iii) the parties (whether within the Reporting Bank or external parties) 
responsible for model validation ascertain that the internal model is 
robust and suitable for its proposed usage, before an internal model 
can be used; 
 
(c) 
on documentation, the Reporting Bank must ensure that – 
 
(i) 
the unit responsible for model validation maintains a log of all 
internal models used and how they are applied within the market risk 
management process and system of the Reporting Bank; and  
 
(ii) 
all internal models used are clearly documented and such 
documentation includes –  
 
(A) a summary of the procedures used when applying each internal 
model; 
 
(B)  a description of the mathematical and statistical aspects of each 
internal model, model applications and limitations; 
 
(C)  an identification of key staff involved in model construction and 
in model validation; 
 
(D)  a log of all the activities related to the construction or alteration 
of each internal model, including the thought process the 
Reporting Bank went through to arrive at the decisions taken; 
and 
 
(E)  a description of the validation procedures and results. 
 
8.3.65 
A Reporting Bank must perform all of the following procedures when validating 
an internal model:  
 
(a) 
review the logical and conceptual soundness of the internal model;  
 
(b) 
verify the model accuracy through conducting backtesting and PLA tests 
in accordance with Sub-division 4 of this Division, and validate the HPL 
calculation methodology;  
 
(c) 
for pricing models, compare the pricing model against – 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-104 
(i) 
an identical model constructed by staff independent of those who 
constructed the first-mentioned pricing model724; or  
 
(ii) 
where the independent construction of an identical model mentioned 
in sub-paragraph (c)(i) cannot be done, another model chosen as a 
benchmark. The Reporting Bank must identify a suitable benchmark 
model, validate the benchmark model, and ensure that the model 
inputs and theory of the benchmark model are similar to the 
Reporting Bank’s pricing model.  
 
8.3.66 
A Reporting Bank must have a model validation process which validates all of 
the following components of each internal model:  
 
(a) 
all model inputs components, which deliver data and assumptions to the 
model; 
 
(b) 
all model processing components, which encompass the theoretical model 
and the computer codes which transform the model inputs into 
mathematical estimates; 
 
(c) 
all reporting components, which translate the mathematical estimates into 
information used to support decision-making. 
 
8.3.67 
In validating any model inputs component referred to in paragraph 8.3.66(a), 
a Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
ensure that data from both internal and external sources is consistent, 
timely, reliable, independent and complete; 
 
(b) 
have procedures to filter out and inspect data to surface potential data 
errors, which include the Reporting Bank verifying the potential data errors 
with an alternate data source; 
 
(c)  automate the extraction of data to the maximum extent possible; 
 
(d)  where manual extraction of data is used, assess whether additional 
validation procedures are necessary to validate such data and perform the 
additional validation, if necessary; 
 
(e) 
ensure that all data required for risk measurement is captured by the 
market risk management model; 
 
(f) 
ensure that assumptions required to model market risks are appropriately 
derived and justified, and do not underestimate risk. This may include the 
assumption of the normal distribution, volatility and correlation 
assumptions, the underlying assumptions where extrapolation or 
interpolation techniques are used, or the assumptions underlying pricing 
models; and 
 
 
724  
If the pricing model is working as expected, the results of the 2 models would coincide. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-105 
(g) 
check all its assumptions at least annually, and when there are structural 
changes in the market or changes to the composition of portfolios, to 
ensure that they do not diverge from observed behaviour.  
 
8.3.68 
In validating any model processing component referred to in paragraph 
8.3.66(b), a Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
validate all internal models, whether they are purchased from a vendor or 
developed by the Reporting Bank, to ensure the accuracy of valuation and 
risk factor calculations, and must not rely solely on a model validation 
done by the vendor; 
 
(b) 
apply the same validation standards to all internal models; 
 
(c) 
apply procedures to test the programmed model and the mathematics 
used against the functional specifications of each internal model; and 
 
(d) 
use hypothetical portfolios to ensure that each internal model is able to 
account for structural features in the IMA portfolio, including –  
 
(i) 
ensuring that basis risks are captured, including mismatches 
between long and short positions by maturity or by issuer; and 
 
(ii) 
ensuring that the internal model captures concentration risk which 
may arise in an undiversified portfolio. 
 
8.3.69 
In validating the reporting component mentioned in paragraph 8.3.66(c), a 
Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
validate the reports in view of their context, and ensure that senior 
management understands the context in which the model results are 
generated; and  
 
(b) 
have a system of checks to ensure that the flow of information from the 
model outputs to the final production of the reports does not contain any 
error. 
 
 
Risk Monitoring 
 
8.3.70 
A Reporting Bank must have a process to monitor its market risks on an ongoing 
basis and to ensure that any change in its risk profile is promptly addressed. The Reporting 
Bank must ensure that the monitoring process includes a mechanism for reviewing and 
reporting compliance with established risk management policies, controls and procedures 
and for addressing exceptions. 
 
8.3.71 
A Reporting Bank must provide the Board, senior management and, where 
appropriate, individual business unit managers with reports on a regular and timely basis. 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that these reports include comparisons of risk taken 
against the corresponding limits. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-106 
8.3.72 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that any significant failures in complying with its 
policies, controls or procedures are reported promptly and, in any case, no later than 5 
business days from becoming aware, to the Board. 
 
8.3.73 
In addition to the reports referred to in paragraph 8.3.71, a Reporting Bank 
must ensure that the Board is given a report at least annually on the extent to which the 
Reporting Bank has complied with its risk management policies, controls and procedures, 
and the effectiveness in managing its market risk.  
 
 
 
Risk Control 
 
8.3.74 
A Reporting Bank must have in place a comprehensive set of risk limits to align 
its business goals with its market risk threshold and to set boundaries for its risk-taking. 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the set of risk limits enables the effectiveness of the 
overall risk management process and system of the Reporting Bank and the adequacy of 
its capital levels, and allows the Reporting Bank to control exposures, to identify 
opportunities and risks and to monitor actual risk-taking against the set of risk limits.  
 
8.3.75 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and senior management establish, 
approve and review the structure of risk limits and high-level risk limits at least annually. 
The Reporting Bank must reassess its risk limits when there are changes in market 
conditions, or the Reporting Bank’s resources, that lead to the risk limits no longer aligning 
the Reporting Bank’s business goals with its market risk threshold or that necessitate a 
change in the boundaries for the Reporting Bank’s risk-taking. 
 
8.3.76 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that a review of the structure of risk limits 
compares risk limits to actual exposures and considers whether these exposures and risk 
limits are appropriate in view of the past performance and current capital levels of the 
Reporting Bank.  
 
8.3.77 
A Reporting Bank must have a clear structure of risk limits across the banking 
group725. The Reporting Bank must ensure consistency between the different types of risk 
limits. The Reporting Bank must ensure that these risk limits are communicated to all 
relevant staff and that positions which exceed these risk limits (i.e. limit excesses) receive 
prompt management attention in accordance with the Reporting Bank’s risk management 
policy. 
 
8.3.78 
A Reporting Bank must establish procedures prescribing the course of action for 
limit excesses. The Reporting Bank must ensure that these procedures include the actions 
required for the approval of temporary limit excesses and limit increases, the investigation 
of the reasons for the infringement of limits and the escalation of limit excesses to 
management in accordance with the Reporting Bank’s risk management policy. 
 
725  
The Reporting Bank should set risk limits for trading desks and for traders, which are commensurate with 
the complexity of trading activities of the Reporting Bank, including its overseas branches and subsidiaries, 
by one or more of the following: 
(a) 
products; 
(b) 
tenors; 
(c) 
concentrations;  
(d) 
markets. 
 
The Reporting Bank should utilise its market risk management model to quantify and assign risk limits by 
individual portfolio, trading desks, activity and trader. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-107 
 
Independent Review  
 
8.3.79 
A Reporting Bank must have an IA which is independent of the activities of the 
market risk-taking units, the risk management unit or units and the model validation unit. 
 
8.3.80 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the IA is subject to proper oversight by the 
Audit Committee.  
 
8.3.81 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the IA carries out an independent review of 
its market risk management process and system, including its market risk management 
model, at least annually726. The Reporting Bank must ensure that this review includes both 
the activities of the trading units and of the independent risk management unit or units. 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the independent review is sufficiently detailed to 
determine which trading desks are impacted by any findings, and must review, at a 
minimum, the following:  
 
(a) 
the organisation of the risk management unit or units; 
 
(b) 
the adequacy of the documentation of the market risk management 
model, process and system; 
 
(c) 
the accuracy and appropriateness of internal models, including any 
significant changes; 
 
(d) 
the verification of the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data 
sources used to run internal models, including the independence of such 
data sources; 
 
(e) 
the approval process for risk pricing models and valuation systems used 
by the Reporting Bank's front-office and back-office personnel; 
 
(f) the scope of market risks reflected in the market risk management models; 
 
(g) 
the integrity of the management information system; 
 
(h) 
the accuracy and completeness of position data; 
 
(i) the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions; 
 
(j) 
the accuracy of valuation and risk transformation calculations; 
 
(k) 
the general alignment between the internal models used for the purposes 
of calculating market risk capital requirements and the market risk 
management model. 
 
8.3.82 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the IA reviews the internal validation 
processes for all internal models at least annually, and that every review by the IA of an 
internal model includes – 
 
726  
The Reporting Bank should increase the depth and frequency of internal audits if significant issues are 
discovered, or if significant changes have been made to product lines, modelling methodologies, the risk 
management process, internal controls or the overall risk profile of the Reporting Bank.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-108 
 
(a) 
verification that the internal validation processes described in paragraphs 
8.3.61 to 8.3.69 are operating in a satisfactory manner; 
 
(b) 
confirmation that the formulae used in the calculation process, as well as 
for the pricing of options and other non-vanilla instruments, are validated 
by a qualified unit, which must be independent from the Reporting Bank's 
trading functions; 
 
(c) 
confirmation that the structure of the internal model is adequate given the 
scope and geographical coverage of the Reporting Bank's activities; 
 
(d) 
a review of the results of the backtesting and PLA tests of the internal 
model to ensure that the internal model provides a reliable measure of 
potential losses over time; and 
 
(e) 
confirmation that data flows and processes associated with the internal 
model are transparent and accessible. 
 
8.3.83 
In performing the independent reviews in paragraphs 8.3.81 and 8.3.82, the 
IA may seek the assistance of other internal or third-party specialists, so long as overall 
responsibility remains with the IA. In the event where the IA has sought assistance from 
internal or third-party specialists in the review process for any class of exposures, a 
Reporting Bank must ensure that such specialists are not involved in or responsible for 
market risk-taking, risk management or model validation activities of the Reporting Bank.  
 
8.3.84 
In performing the independent reviews in paragraphs 8.3.81 and 8.3.82, a 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the IA takes into account any changes in its risk profile. 
The Reporting Bank must update the audit programme used by the IA to reflect any 
changes to the workflow processes of the trading units, risk management unit or units and 
model validation unit.  
 
8.3.85 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the findings of any independent review are 
reported directly to the Board. If there are corrective actions to be taken, the Reporting 
Bank must carry out such actions within a reasonable time. 
 
8.3.86 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the staff of the Reporting Bank are not 
involved in the internal audit of a trading unit, independent risk management unit or model 
validation unit if they have been involved in the activities of that respective unit in the 
preceding 12 months.  
 
 
 
Stress testing 
 
8.3.87 
A Reporting Bank must have in place a rigorous and comprehensive stress 
testing framework, both at the trading desk level and at the IMA portfolio level. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the results of any stress testing conducted in accordance 
with the stress testing framework are – 
 
(a) 
reviewed at least monthly by the senior management of the Reporting 
Bank; 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-109 
 
(b) 
used in the Reporting Bank’s internal assessment of capital adequacy; and 
 
(c) 
reflected in the policies and limits set by the Reporting Bank’s Board, 
senior management, or both. 
 
8.3.88 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that all stress testing incorporates both market 
risk and liquidity risk aspects of market disturbances and comprises 3 components – 
 
(a) 
identifying plausible stress scenarios to which the Reporting Bank could 
be exposed; 
 
(b) 
evaluating the ability of the Reporting Bank’s capital to absorb potential 
large losses; and 
 
(c) 
identifying steps which the Reporting Bank can take to reduce its risk and 
conserve capital. 
 
8.3.89 
A Reporting Bank must use stress testing as a means for setting its policies and 
limits, under both stressed and normal business conditions, and for monitoring new 
instruments where no historical data is available.  
 
8.3.90 
A Reporting Bank must use its stress test results as a basis for identifying 
vulnerabilities in its portfolios. 
 
8.3.91 
A Reporting Bank must incorporate stress testing in its day-to-day risk 
management process. Where stress tests reveal a particular vulnerability to a given set of 
circumstances, the Reporting Bank must take prompt steps to manage those risks 
appropriately727. 
 
8.3.92 
A Reporting Bank must take into consideration the nature of its portfolios and 
the environment in which it operates when formulating stress scenarios. The Reporting 
Bank must ensure that stress scenarios cover a range of factors which can create 
extraordinary losses or gains in trading portfolios, or make the control of risk in those 
portfolios very difficult728. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the stress scenarios are 
designed to assess the impact of such factors on all traded positions, including positions 
which display both linear and non-linear price characteristics729.  
 
8.3.93 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the stress tests in its stress testing 
framework are conducted by the Reporting Bank at least once a month.  
 
8.3.94 
A Reporting Bank must use stress test scenarios developed by the Reporting 
Bank in combination with stress test scenarios provided by the Authority. The Reporting 
Bank must provide the stress test scenarios and results to the Authority upon the 
Authority’s request. The Reporting Bank must, at the minimum, perform stress tests based 
on all of the following stress scenarios:  
 
727  
For example, by hedging that outcome or reducing the size of the exposures or increasing capital. 
728  
Factors include events in all major types of risks, including various components of market, credit, and 
operational risks, regardless of the probability of the event occurring.   
729  
Examples of such positions are options and instruments with optionality.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-110 
 
(a) 
scenarios requiring no simulations by the Reporting Bank – 
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank must document its 5 largest daily trading losses 
over the last 250 trading days, computed on a rolling basis. The 
Reporting Bank must compare this information to the level of capital 
requirements that would result from the internal models of the 
Reporting Bank730; 
 
(b) 
scenarios requiring a simulation by the Reporting Bank –  
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank must test its portfolios against past periods of 
significant disturbance731;  
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank must evaluate the sensitivity of its market risk 
exposures to changes in the assumptions about volatilities and 
correlations. In applying this test, the Reporting Bank must evaluate 
the historical range of variation for volatilities and correlations and 
evaluate the positions of the Reporting Bank against the extreme 
values of the historical range732; and 
 
(iii) the Reporting Bank must conduct ad-hoc stress tests on specific 
areas whenever this is warranted under special circumstances733; 
 
(c) 
scenarios to capture the specific characteristics of a portfolio – 
 
(i) 
a Reporting Bank must develop its own stress scenarios which it 
identifies as most adverse, based on the characteristics of the 
portfolio. The Reporting Bank must provide the Authority with a 
description of the methodology used to identify the stress scenarios.  
 
8.3.95 
For each stress scenario, a Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a) 
incorporate the price movements and reduction in liquidity associated with 
the stress scenario; 
 
(b) 
recognise the potential for feedback effects, which measure the second-
round impact arising from its own activities; 
 
 
730  
For example, by assessing the number of days over the last 12 months of which largest daily trading losses 
would have been covered by a given ES estimate. 
731  
Examples of past periods of significant disturbance include the 1987 equity crash, the Exchange Rate 
Mechanism crises of 1992 and 1993, the increase in interest rates in the first quarter of 1994, the 1997 
Asian financial crisis, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the 2000 bursting of the technology stock bubble, 
the 2007/2008 sub-prime mortgage crisis, or the 2011/2012 Euro zone crisis.  
732  
A Reporting Bank should consider the sharp variation in volatilities and correlations that at times has 
occurred in a matter of days in periods of significant market disturbance. For example, the examples of 
past periods of significant disturbance mentioned in footnote 731 involved correlations within risk factors 
approaching the extreme values of 1 or -1 for several days at the height of the disturbance. 
733  
For example, in light of rapidly deteriorating economic or political conditions in a country or industry, the 
Reporting Bank may need to make a quick assessment of the likely impact on its exposures to that country 
or industry. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-111 
(c) 
evaluate the impact of the failure of a major player in a concentrated 
market; and 
 
(d) 
evaluate the impact if assumptions made in the internal model do not 
hold734. 
 
8.3.96 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the stress tests conducted are meaningful 
and reasonably conservative. The Reporting Bank must construct stress test scenarios 
with input from trading units and review the stress test scenarios on an ongoing basis to 
ensure they are relevant and plausible. 
 
8.3.97 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the stress tests are not limited to 
quantitative exercises which compute potential losses or gains. 735 The Reporting Bank 
must ensure that stress tests also include more qualitative analyses of the actions that 
senior management might take under each stress test scenario, and that contingency 
plans outlining operating procedures and lines of communication, both formal and informal, 
are developed as a result of such qualitative analyses.  
 
 
Sub-division 3: Model Requirements 
 
 
Specification of Risk Factors 
 
8.3.98 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that risk factors specified in its internal models 
– 
 
(a) 
are sufficient to represent the risks inherent in the Reporting Bank's IMA 
portfolio; and 
 
(b) 
fulfil the requirements of paragraphs 8.3.99 to 8.3.107. 
 
8.3.99 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its internal models include –  
 
(a)  all risk factors that are incorporated in the Reporting Bank's corresponding 
pricing model, unless the Reporting Bank is able to justify the omission to 
the satisfaction of the Authority; and  
  
 
(b)  all risk factors, except for risk factors for securitisation exposures736, that 
are specified in the SA(MR) for the corresponding risk class, in Division 2 
of this Part, unless the Reporting Bank is able to justify the omission to 
the satisfaction of the Authority.  
  
 
 
734  
For example, if a breakdown in historical correlation occurs. 
735  
The Reporting Bank should, in designing its stress tests, consider the following: 
(a) 
the possibility of not being able to unwind some less liquid positions as quickly as intended during a 
crisis situation and that the values of these positions may be very volatile. Such considerations are 
particularly important for concentrated positions or positions in emerging markets; 
(b) 
possible linkages across different markets;   
(c) 
supplementing its scenario testing with sensitivity tests on individual risk factors. 
736  
Risk factors for securitisation exposures are not specified under the IMA, as a Reporting Bank must use the 
SA(MR) to determine market risk capital requirements for securitisation exposures under paragraph 8.1.20.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-112 
8.3.100 
Where a Reporting Bank has omitted a risk factor pursuant to paragraph 8.3.99, 
the Reporting Bank must document the omission, together with an estimate of the risks 
not captured by the model as a result of the omission of the risk factor, in a “Risk-Not-
Captured” report to the Board and senior management.  
 
8.3.101 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its internal models and any stress scenarios 
used to calculate capital requirements for NMRFs address non-linearities737, correlation 
risk and basis risks738. 
 
8.3.102 
For general interest rate risk, a Reporting Bank must use risk factors that 
correspond to the interest rates associated with each currency in which the Reporting Bank 
has one or more interest rate-sensitive market risk positions. The Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
model each relevant yield curve using a generally accepted approach739; 
and 
 
(b) 
divide each modelled yield curve into maturity segments, with each 
maturity segment corresponding to a risk factor, in order to capture 
variation in the volatility of rates along the yield curve, and in so doing – 
 
(i) 
determine the number of risk factors to be used based on the nature 
of the Reporting Bank's trading strategies, using a greater number 
of risk factors where the Reporting Bank engages in complex 
arbitrage strategies or has positions in various types of instruments 
across many points of a yield curve; and 
 
(ii) 
model a yield curve pertaining to the Reporting Bank's material 
exposures to interest rate movements in major currencies and 
markets using a minimum of 6 risk factors. 
 
8.3.103 
For credit spread risk, a Reporting Bank must use risk factors that correspond 
to credit spreads which the Reporting Bank has credit risk exposure to.740  
 
8.3.104 
For equity risk, a Reporting Bank must use risk factors that correspond to each 
equity market which the Reporting Bank has equity risk exposure to. For each equity 
market, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the sophistication and nature of the 
modelling of risk factors for each equity market is commensurate with the Reporting Bank's 
exposure to the equity market and the concentration of the Reporting Bank's exposure to 
individual equities in the equity market. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the risk 
factors capture the volatility and correlation effects of individual equities in the equity 
market. Where it is not possible to have risk factors corresponding to individual equities 
in the equity market –   
 
 
737  
For example, for options or other products with non-linear risks, such as mortgage-backed securities. 
738  
For example, basis risks between credit default swaps and bonds. 
739  
For example, estimating the forward rates of zero coupon yields. 
740  
The Reporting Bank may use a variety of approaches to model credit spread risk arising from less-than-
perfectly correlated movements between government-issued instruments and non-government-issued 
fixed income instruments. For example, the Reporting Bank may model credit spread risk – 
(a) 
by specifying a separate yield curve for non-government-issued fixed income instruments such as 
swaps or municipal securities; or 
(b)  by estimating the credit spread between non-government-issued fixed income instruments and 
government-issued instruments at various points along the yield curve.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-113 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must, at a minimum, use risk factors that reflect 
market-wide movements in equity price741. For this purpose, the Reporting 
Bank may express a position in an individual equity or a sector equity 
index as a beta-equivalent relative to a market-wide equity index; and 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank may utilise risk factors that correspond to various 
sectors of the equity market742. For this purpose, the Reporting Bank may 
express a position in an individual equity within a given sector as a beta-
equivalent relative to the relevant sector equity index.  
 
8.3.105 
For foreign exchange risk, a Reporting Bank must use risk factors that 
correspond to the exchange rates between the Reporting Bank's reporting currency and 
each foreign currency which the Reporting Bank has exposure to. 
 
8.3.106 
For commodity risk, a Reporting Bank must use risk factors that correspond to 
each commodity market which the Reporting Bank has commodity risk exposure to. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that – 
 
(a)  the modelling of commodity risk factors captures –  
 
(i)  
directional risk, which is the exposure to changes in spot prices 
arising from net open positions; 
 
(ii)  forward gap and interest rate risk, which is the exposure to changes 
in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches; 
 
(iii)  basis risk, which is the exposure to changes in the price relationships 
between 2 similar but not identical commodities; 
 
(iv)  market characteristics, including delivery dates and the scope 
provided to traders to close out positions; and 
 
(v)  variation in the “convenience yield” between derivatives positions743 
and cash positions in the commodity, if the Reporting Bank is 
engaged in active commodities trading; and 
 
(b)  the risk factors used are commensurate with the commodity exposure of 
the Reporting Bank. 
 
8.3.107 
For a position in an equity investment in a fund744 that meets the criterion set 
out in paragraph 8.1.27(e)(i), a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a)  assign the position to the trading desk to which the fund is assigned; and 
 
(b) 
treat the position and specify risk factors as if the constituent positions of 
the fund were held directly by the Reporting Bank, taking into account – 
 
741  
For example, a market index. 
742  
For example, industry sectors, cyclical and non-cyclical sectors. 
743  
For example, forwards and swaps.  
744  
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must use the SA(MR) to calculate the market risk capital requirements 
for a position in an equity investment in a fund that does not meet the criterion set out in paragraph 
8.1.27(e)(i) but meets the criterion set out in paragraph 8.1.27(e)(ii) as set out in paragraph 8.1.20. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-114 
 
(i) 
the risks of the fund and any associated hedges; 
 
(ii) 
the share of the equity of the fund held by the Reporting Bank; and 
 
(iii) any leverage in the structure of the fund. 
 
 
 
Model Eligibility of Risk Factors 
 
8.3.108 
A Reporting Bank must include a risk factor within trading desks that are in-
scope of the IMA in the Reporting Bank's ES model only where the Reporting Bank has 
assessed that the risk factor has passed the risk factor eligibility test in accordance with 
paragraph 8.3.111 and meets the requirements for the modellability of risk factors as 
defined in paragraph 8.3.127. Otherwise, the Reporting Bank must treat such a risk factor 
as a NMRF. 
 
8.3.109 
For the purposes of the risk factor eligibility test in paragraph 8.3.111, a real 
price refers to a price that meets at least one of the following criteria:  
 
(a) 
it is a price at which the Reporting Bank has conducted a transaction;  
 
(b) 
it is a verifiable price for an actual transaction between parties on an arm’s 
length basis;  
 
(c) 
it is a price obtained from a committed quote made by the Reporting Bank 
or another party. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the committed 
quote is collected and verified through a third-party vendor, a trading 
platform or an exchange; 
 
(d) 
it is a price that is obtained from a third-party vendor, where –  
 
(i) 
the transaction or committed quote has been processed through the 
vendor; 
 
(ii) 
the vendor agrees to provide evidence of the transaction or 
committed quote to the Authority or bank regulatory agencies upon 
request; or 
 
(iii) the price meets any of the criteria in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c). 
 
8.3.110 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.3.109, a committed quote means a price 
provided at arm’s length at which the provider of the price must buy or sell an instrument.  
 
8.3.111 
A Reporting Bank must assess a risk factor to have passed the risk factor 
eligibility test for a given quarter, only if the risk factor meets at least one of the following 
criteria as at the end of the quarter:  
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank has identified at least 24 real price observations for 
the risk factor per year over the period used to calibrate the ES model, 
and has ensured that over the previous 250 trading days, there is no 90-


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-115 
day period in which fewer than 4 real price observations in respect of the 
risk factor are identified; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank has identified at least 100 real price observations for 
the risk factor over the previous 250 trading days.  
 
For the purposes of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), the Reporting Bank must count only one 
real price observation per day. The Reporting Bank must also monitor whether each risk 
factor meets the criteria in sub-paragraph (a) on a monthly basis. 
 
8.3.112 
When performing the risk factor eligibility test defined in paragraph 8.3.111 for 
a new benchmark rate, a Reporting Bank may, until one year after the discontinuation of 
the old benchmark rate, use both – 
 
(a)  real price observations of the old benchmark rate (that has been replaced 
by the new benchmark rate) before the discontinuation of the old 
benchmark rate; and 
 
(b)  real price observations of the new benchmark rate. 
 
For the purposes of this paragraph, discontinuation of an old benchmark rate refers to 
cessation of the old benchmark rate or an event whereby the old benchmark rate is 
deemed by its regulator to no longer be representative of the underlying market. 
 
8.3.113 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.3.111, where a Reporting Bank uses data for 
real price observations from an internal or external data source that can only provide such 
real price observations with a time lag 745, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the 
difference between the date on which the period used for the risk factor eligibility test ends 
and the date on which the period used to calibrate the ES model ends must not be greater 
than one month. 
 
8.3.114 
A Reporting Bank may replace a NMRF with –  
 
(a)  a combination of one or more modellable risk factors; and  
 
(b)  a basis between the combination of modellable risk factors referred to in 
sub-paragraph (a) and the NMRF being replaced. 
 
The Reporting Bank must treat the basis referred to in sub-paragraph (b) as a NMRF. 
 
8.3.115 
For the purposes of performing the risk factor eligibility test in paragraph 
8.3.111 for a risk factor, a Reporting Bank may include in the count a real price observation 
based on information collected from a third-party vendor, provided that all of the following 
criteria are met: 
 
(a) 
the third-party vendor has communicated to the Reporting Bank the date 
on which the real price observation was observed; 
 
(b) 
the third-party vendor has provided the Reporting Bank identifier 
information on the real price observation to enable the Reporting Bank to 
 
745  
For example, where data for a particular day is made available a number of weeks later.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-116 
map the real price observed to the relevant risk factor for which the risk 
factor eligibility test is being carried out; 
 
(c) 
the third-party vendor is subject to an audit regarding the validity of its 
pricing information on an annual basis, and the results and reports of each 
audit are available to the Authority and to the Reporting Bank upon 
request. Where the process or the results of an audit of the third-party 
vendor are not satisfactory to the Authority, the Authority may disallow 
the Reporting Bank from counting any real price observations based on 
information collected from the third-party vendor for the purposes of the 
risk factor eligibility test in paragraph 8.3.111. To avoid doubt, the 
Reporting Bank may be permitted to use real price observations from the 
third-party vendor for other risk factors if the third-party vendor meets 
the criteria specified in this paragraph for the other risk factors. 
 
8.3.116 
A Reporting Bank may treat a real price as being representative of a risk factor 
only where the Reporting Bank is able to derive the value of the risk factor from the value 
of the real price. The Reporting Bank must have policies and procedures that set out the 
Reporting Bank's methodologies for mapping real price observations to risk factors, and 
must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that such methodologies are 
appropriate. Where the Authority is not satisfied that a methodology for mapping real price 
observations to a risk factor is appropriate, the Authority may disallow the Reporting Bank 
from counting the real price observations for a risk factor derived using the methodology 
for the purposes of the risk factor eligibility test in paragraph 8.3.111. 
 
 
 
Bucketing Approach for the Risk Factor Eligibility Test 
 
8.3.117 
Where a risk factor is a point on a curve, a surface or other higher dimensional 
objects including cubes, a Reporting Bank may employ either of the following bucketing 
approaches in order to count real price observations for the risk factor for the risk factor 
eligibility test set out in paragraph 8.3.111:  
 
(a) 
the own bucketing approach set out in paragraph 8.3.118; 
 
(b) 
the regulatory bucketing approach set out in paragraph 8.3.119. 
 
8.3.118 
Under the own bucketing approach, a Reporting Bank must define the buckets 
and ensure that the buckets defined meet the following requirements: 
 
(a) 
each bucket must include only one risk factor, and the risk factors used 
for the purposes of bucket definition must be the same as the risk factors 
used to calculate the RTPL of the Reporting Bank for the purposes of the 
PLA test set out in paragraphs 8.3.165 to 8.3.171746; 
 
(b) 
the buckets must not overlap. 
 
 
746  
The Reporting Bank, when designing its ES model, should consider that defining more granular buckets 
may facilitate a trading desk’s success in meeting the requirements of the PLA test, but may also challenge 
the Reporting Bank’s ability to source a sufficient number of real price observations to meet the 
requirements of the risk factor eligibility test. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-117 
8.3.119 
Under the regulatory bucketing approach, a Reporting Bank must use the 
following bucket structure: 
 
(a) 
for interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity risk factors that have 
one maturity dimension and that are not implied volatilities, the Reporting 
Bank must use the buckets in Table 8-16; 
 
(b) 
for interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity risk factors that have 
2 or more maturity dimensions and that are not implied volatilities, the 
Reporting Bank must use the buckets in Table 8-17; 
 
(c) 
for credit spread and equity risk factors that have one or more maturity 
dimensions and that are not implied volatilities, the Reporting Bank must 
use the buckets in Table 8-18; 
 
(d) 
for any risk factors with one or more strike dimensions and that are not 
implied volatilities, the Reporting Bank must use the buckets in Table 8-
19. In a case of an options market where an alternative definition of 
moneyness other than delta δ is the applicable market standard convention, 
the Reporting Bank must map the applicable market standard convention 
to the buckets in Table 8-19 using internal pricing models which have been 
approved by the Authority for this purpose; 
 
(e) 
for the expiry and strike dimensions of risk factors that are implied 
volatilities and that do not arise from interest rate swaptions, the 
Reporting Bank must use the buckets in Table 8-20; 
 
(f) 
for the maturity, expiry and strike dimensions of risk factors that are 
implied volatilities and that arise from interest rate swaptions, the 
Reporting Bank must use the buckets in Table 8-21.

8.3.120 
 For each risk factor, a Reporting Bank must assign a real price observation that 
is representative of the risk factor, determined in accordance with paragraph 8.3.116, to 
the bucket to which the risk factor belongs and count all real price observations that are 
representative of the risk factor and assigned to the bucket, to assess whether the risk 
factor would pass the risk factor eligibility test.   
 
8.3.121 
 A Reporting Bank must not assign a real price observation to more than one 
bucket for the purposes of the risk factor eligibility test. 
 
8.3.122 
As debt instruments mature, a Reporting Bank may re-assign the real price 
observations representative of the credit spread risk factor to a bucket with a shorter 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-119 
maturity that is adjacent to the bucket the real price observations were initially assigned 
in accordance with paragraph 8.3.117747, if –  
 
(a)  the real price observations for those debt instruments have been identified 
within the 250 trading days prior to each reporting date; and 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank no longer needs to model a credit spread risk factor 
for the bucket the real price observations were initially assigned.  
 
8.3.123 
Where a Reporting Bank uses a parametric function, calibrated using market 
data, to represent a curve, a surface or higher dimensional objects including cubes and 
defines the function’s parameters as the risk factors in its internal models, the Reporting 
Bank must pass the risk factor eligibility test at the level of the market data used to 
calibrate the function’s parameters, and not at the level of these risk factor parameters748. 
 
8.3.124 
A Reporting Bank may use systematic credit or equity risk factors, within its 
internal models, that are designed to capture market-wide movements for a given 
economy, region or sector but not the idiosyncratic risk of a specific issuer. The Reporting 
Bank may treat real price observations of market indices or instruments of individual 
issuers as being representative of a systematic risk factor only if the real price observation 
shares the same economy, region or sector attributes as the systematic risk factor. 
 
8.3.125 
 In cases where the systematic credit or equity risk factor includes a maturity 
dimension749, a Reporting Bank must use one of the bucketing approaches set out in 
paragraph 8.3.117 to assign the real price observations for the risk factor eligibility test. 
 
8.3.126 
 Subject to paragraph 8.3.127, a Reporting Bank must calibrate the ES model 
for a risk factor that has passed the risk factor eligibility test using data that is 
representative of the risk factor. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank may use data that is 
different from the data used to pass the risk factor eligibility test for each risk factor.  
 
 
Requirements for the modellability of risk factors that pass the risk factor 
eligibility test 
 
8.3.127 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the requirements set out in paragraphs 
8.3.128 to 8.3.137 and Annex 8B for the modellability of risk factors, including on the use 
of data, are met for a risk factor that has passed the risk factor eligibility test, in order for 
that risk factor to be modellable using the ES model and calibrated in accordance with 
paragraph 8.3.126. Otherwise, the Reporting Bank must subject the risk factor to capital 
requirements as a NMRF. The Reporting Bank must be able to demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Authority that these requirements are met. Where the Reporting Bank 
has not met these requirements to the satisfaction of the Authority for a particular risk 
factor, the Authority may require the Reporting Bank to deem the data unsuitable for use 
 
747  
For example, if a bond with an original maturity of 4 years had a real price observation on its issuance date 
8 months ago, the Reporting Bank may opt to assign the real price observation to the bucket associated 
with a maturity between 1.5 and 3.5 years instead of to the bucket associated with a maturity between 3.5 
and 7.5 years, if the Reporting Bank no longer needs to model a credit spread risk factor for the bucket 
associated with the maturity between 3.5 and 7.5 years. 
748  
This is due to the fact that real price observations that are directly representative of these risk factor 
parameters may not exist. 
749  
For example, a credit spread curve. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-120 
to calibrate the ES model, and, in such a case, the Reporting Bank must exclude the risk 
factor from its ES model and subject the risk factor to capital requirements as a NMRF. 
 
8.3.128 
 A Reporting Bank may treat a risk factor that is derived solely from a 
combination of modellable risk factors as a modellable risk factor750, provided that the 
Reporting Bank ensures that all of the following requirements are met:   
 
(a)  the risk factor that is derived solely from a combination of modellable risk 
factors itself must pass the risk factor eligibility test; 
 
(b)  interpolations based on combinations of modellable risk factors must be 
consistent with the mappings used for PLA testing (to determine the RTPL) 
and not based on alternative bucketing approaches. Subject to written 
approval from the Authority, the Reporting Bank may extrapolate up to a 
reasonable distance from the closest modellable risk factor751. In the event 
that the Reporting Bank uses extrapolation, the Reporting Bank must 
factor in the extrapolation in the determination of the RTPL. 
 
8.3.129 
  A Reporting Bank may compress risk factors into a smaller dimension of 
orthogonal risk factors752 and derive parameters from observations of modellable risk 
factors753 without the parameters being directly observable in the market. 
 
8.3.130 
 A Reporting Bank must use data that allow the ES model to capture both 
idiosyncratic and general market risk. If the Reporting Bank uses data that do not reflect 
either idiosyncratic or general market risk in the ES model, the Reporting Bank must 
calculate capital requirements for those risk factors that are not adequately captured in 
the ES model as a NMRF. 
 
8.3.131 
 A Reporting Bank must use data that allow the ES model to reflect volatility 
and correlation of its risk positions. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the data do not 
understate the volatility of an asset754 and that the data accurately reflect the correlation 
of asset prices, rates across yield curves and volatilities within volatility surfaces. The 
Reporting Bank must choose data sources to ensure that –  
 
(a) 
the data are representative of real price observations;  
 
(b)  price volatility is not understated by the choice of data; and 
 
(c)  correlations are reasonable approximations of correlations among real 
price observations. 
 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that any transformations of data accurately reflect the 
correlations arising from risk factors used in the Reporting Bank’s ES model, and do not 
understate the volatility arising from risk factors. 
 
750  
For example, the Reporting Bank may classify risk factors derived through multifactor beta models for 
which inputs and calibrations are based solely on modellable risk factors as modellable, and include these 
risk factors within its ES model. 
751  
The Reporting Bank should ensure that the extrapolation is reliant on more than one modellable risk factor, 
and not solely on the closest modellable risk factor.   
752  
For example, principal components. 
753  
For example, in models of stochastic implied volatility. 
754  
For example, by using inappropriate averaging of data or proxies. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-121 
 
8.3.132 
 A Reporting Bank must use data that are derived from prices observed or 
quoted in the market. Where it is not possible to use data derived from real price 
observations, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the data used are reasonably 
representative of real price observations. The Reporting Bank must periodically reconcile 
price data used in risk models with front office and back office prices755. The Reporting 
Bank must document its approach to deriving risk factors from market prices. 
 
8.3.133 
 A Reporting Bank must update the data used in the ES model minimally on a 
monthly basis, and as often as possible to account for turnover of positions in its trading 
portfolio and changing market conditions.756 A Reporting Bank must have a workflow 
process for updating its sources of data. Where the Reporting Bank uses regressions to 
estimate risk factor parameters, the Reporting Bank must re-estimate these no less 
frequently than every 2 weeks. The Reporting Bank must also calibrate pricing models to 
current market prices on a sufficiently frequent basis, and no less frequently than the 
calibration of front office pricing models757. 
 
8.3.134 
 In calculating the ES measure in a period of stress in accordance with 
paragraphs 8.3.186 to 8.3.191, a Reporting Bank must use data that are reflective of 
market prices observed or quoted in the period of stress, and must source the data directly 
from the period of stress where possible. The Reporting Bank must empirically justify any 
instances where the market prices used for the period of stress are different from the 
market prices actually observed during that period and –   
 
(a)  where instruments that are currently traded did not exist during the period 
of stress, the Reporting Bank must demonstrate that the prices used 
match changes in prices or spreads of similar instruments during the 
period of stress;  
 
(b) 
where the Reporting Bank is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Authority that it has sufficient justification for the use of market data 
observed after the period of stress for products whose characteristics have 
changed since the period of stress, the Reporting Bank must omit the risk 
factor for the period of stress and meet the requirement in paragraph 
8.3.186(e) that the reduced set of risk factors explain 75% of the fully 
specified ES model; and  
 
(c) 
where name-specific risk factors are used to calculate the ES measure for 
the current period, and these names were not available in the period of 
stress, the Reporting Bank must presume that the idiosyncratic part of 
these risk factors are not in the reduced set of risk factors referred to in 
paragraph 8.3.186. The Reporting Bank must map exposures to risk 
factors that are included in the full set of risk factors but not in the reduced 
set of risk factors, to the most suitable risk factor in the reduced set of 
risk factors for the purposes of calculating the ES measure in the period 
of stress. 
 
 
755  
In comparing front or back office prices with price data used in risk models, the Reporting Bank should 
compare price data used in risk models with real price observations, where available. 
756  
The Reporting Bank should update its data daily.  
757  
Where appropriate, the Reporting Bank should have clear policies for backfilling or gap-filling missing data, 
or both. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-122 
8.3.135 
A Reporting Bank must limit its use of proxies to represent risk factors. Where 
the Reporting Bank uses proxies, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the proxies used 
are representative of the risk factors758, have sufficiently similar characteristics to the 
positions they represent, and are appropriate for the region, quality and type of instrument 
they are intended to represent. The Reporting Bank must be able to justify the use of any 
proxy to the satisfaction of the Authority.  
 
8.3.136 
Where a risk factor is represented by proxy data in the ES model, the Reporting 
Bank must either – 
 
(a) 
use the proxy data representation of the risk factor (i.e. not the risk factor 
itself) in the RTPL; or 
 
(b) 
use the actual data representation of the risk factor in the RTPL, and 
identify the basis between the proxy and the actual risk factor as a 
separate risk factor, and – 
 
(i) 
if the basis passes the risk factor eligibility test in accordance with 
paragraph 8.3.111, include the basis in the Reporting Bank’s ES 
model; and 
 
(ii) 
in all other cases, treat the basis as a NMRF. 
 
8.3.137 
Where a Reporting Bank’s use of proxies involves use of a multifactor model, 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that – 
 
(a) 
the use of indices in the multifactor model captures the correlated risk of 
the assets represented by the indices, and the Reporting Bank is able to 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that the remaining 
idiosyncratic risk is uncorrelated across different issuers; 
 
(b)  the multifactor model has significant explanatory power for the price 
movements of assets and provides an assessment of the uncertainty in 
the final outcome due to the use of a proxy; and 
 
(c) 
the coefficients759 of a multifactor model are empirically based and are not 
determined based on judgement. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must 
treat a risk factor for which a proxy is determined using a multifactor 
model with coefficients determined based on judgement as a NMRF. 
 
 
Sub-division 4: Backtesting and P&L Attribution Test Requirements 
 
8.3.138 
A Reporting Bank must implement the backtesting programme and the PLA test 
from and inclusive of the date that the Reporting Bank adopts the IMA to determine its 
market risk capital requirements.  
 
 
 
 
758  
For example, the Reporting Bank may use an equity index as a proxy for a position in an individual stock.   
759  
The coefficients can also be referred to as betas.

8.3.139 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the APL includes –  
 
(a)  P&L arising from FX and commodity risks, from positions held in the 
banking book; 
 
(b)  P&L arising from intraday trading; 
 
(c)  P&L arising from transactions that are newly made or modified, on the 
date for which the APL is being calculated; 
 
(d)  P&L arising from the passage of time760; and 
 
(e)  subject to paragraph 8.3.140(b) and (c), any market risk-related valuation 
adjustment, irrespective of the frequency at which they are calculated.  
The Reporting Bank must not perform smoothing of valuation adjustments 
that are not calculated daily. 
 
8.3.140 
A Reporting Bank must exclude all of the following from the APL: 
 
(a)  fees and commissions; 
 
(b)  credit valuation adjustments for which the Reporting Bank calculates CVA 
RWA in accordance with Division 5 of this Part;  
 
(c)  valuation adjustments that are deducted from CET1 Capital pursuant to 
paragraph 6.1.3(g) and (n) of Part VI. 
 
8.3.141 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the HPL includes – 
  
(a) 
P&L arising from FX and commodity risks, from positions held in the 
banking book; and  
 
(b) 
subject to paragraph 8.3.142(d) and (e), valuation adjustments that are 
calculated daily, unless a Reporting Bank has obtained written approval 
from the Authority to exclude these valuation adjustments.  
 
8.3.142 
A Reporting Bank must exclude all of the following from the HPL: 
 
(a) 
fees and commissions; 
 
(b) 
P&L arising from intraday trading; 
 
(c) 
P&L arising from transactions that are newly made or modified on the date 
for which the HPL is being calculated; 
 
(d) 
credit valuation adjustments for which the Reporting Bank calculates CVA 
RWA in accordance with Division 5 of this Part;  
 
760  
For example, theta effect (i.e. the first-order derivative of price relative to time), costs of carry, or costs of 
funding.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-124 
 
(e) 
valuation adjustments that are deducted from CET1 Capital pursuant to 
paragraph 6.1.3(g) and (n) of Part VI. 
 
8.3.143 
A Reporting Bank may exclude valuation adjustments that the Reporting Bank 
is unable to calculate at the trading desk level 761 from the APL and the HPL, for the 
purposes of backtesting at the trading desk level. The Reporting Bank must be able to 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority, at the Authority’s request, that it is unable 
to calculate the valuation adjustments at the trading desk level. To avoid doubt, the 
Reporting Bank must include such valuation adjustments for the purposes of backtesting 
at the IMA portfolio level.  
 
8.3.144 
A Reporting Bank must calculate both APL and HPL based on the same pricing 
models as the ones used to produce the daily P&L that the Reporting Bank uses in its 
reports. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the models used to calculate APL and HPL 
have the same pricing functions, pricing configurations, model parameterisation, market 
data and systems as the pricing models used to produce the daily P&L that the Reporting 
Bank uses in its reports. 
 
8.3.145 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that for each trading desk, the market risk 
management model includes all modellable risk factors that are included in the ES model 
and the NMRFs.  The Reporting Bank must ensure that the RTPL does not take into account 
any risk factors that the Reporting Bank does not include in its market risk management 
model.  
 
8.3.146 
A Reporting Bank must treat P&L resulting from the passage of time consistently 
in both HPL and RTPL. 
 
8.3.147 
A Reporting Bank must use the same HPL for the PLA test and for backtesting 
required under paragraph 8.3.149.  
 
8.3.148 
A Reporting Bank must include in APL, HPL and RTPL, movements in all risk 
factors contained in the Reporting Bank’s market risk management model for each trading 
desk, even if the forecasting component of the model uses data that incorporates 
additional residual risk. 
 
 
 
 Backtesting Overview 
 
8.3.149 
 A Reporting Bank must perform backtesting at both the IMA portfolio level in 
accordance with paragraphs 8.3.150 to 8.3.152, and paragraphs 8.3.153 to 8.3.158, and 
the trading desk level in accordance with paragraphs 8.3.150 to 8.3.152, and paragraphs 
8.3.159 to 8.3.162762.  
 
8.3.150 
 A Reporting Bank must ensure that the returns used for VaR calculation are 
equally weighted.  
 
 
761  
For example, because the valuation adjustments are assessed in terms of the bank’s overall positions or 
risks, or because of other constraints around the assessment process. 
762  
A Reporting Bank may implement additional backtesting using VaR measures at a confidence level other 
than the 97.5th percentile or 99th percentile one-tailed confidence level, or may perform other statistical 
tests not set out in this Notice. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-125 
8.3.151 
Despite paragraph 8.3.150, a Reporting Bank may use volatility scaling of 
returns for all observations for a selected risk factor or group of risk factors to reflect a 
more recent period of stress if the volatility scaling of returns does not result in a shorter 
observation period being used for VaR calculation. The Reporting Bank must notify the 
Authority before using this scaled data to calculate VaR and ES estimates. 
 
8.3.152 
A Reporting Bank must document all of the exceptions generated from its 
ongoing backtesting at both the IMA portfolio level and at the trading desk level, including 
an explanation for each exception. 
 
 
Backtesting at the IMA portfolio level 
 
8.3.153 
A Reporting Bank must conduct backtesting for the portfolio of all the positions 
attributed to trading desks that are in-scope of the IMA (i.e. IMA portfolio level) by 
comparing the one-day VaR measure at the 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence level, 
against each of the APL and against each of the HPL, registered in a day over 250 trading 
days prior to each reporting date. A Reporting Bank must ensure that the one-day VAR 
measure is calibrated to a one-day holding period and to the most recent 250 trading days’ 
data. 
 
8.3.154 
The Reporting Bank must count the number of exceptions under the backtesting 
conducted in paragraph 8.3.153 as follows:  
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must count each observation when either the actual 
loss or the hypothetical loss of the IMA portfolio registered in a day of the 
backtesting period exceeds the corresponding daily VaR measure given by 
the Reporting Bank’s internal model;  
 
(b) 
in the event that either the P&L or the daily VaR measure is not available 
or is impossible to calculate for a given day over the prior 250 trading 
days, the Reporting Bank must count this as an exception;  
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must count exceptions for actual losses separately 
from exceptions for hypothetical losses, and count the overall number of 
exceptions as the greater of these 2 amounts.  
 
8.3.155 
For the purposes of counting the number of exceptions in paragraph 8.3.154, 
subject to the Authority’s written approval, a Reporting Bank may exclude an exception if 
the Reporting Bank has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Authority that the 
exception was caused by a NMRF, and the stress scenario capital requirement for that 
NMRF, which is calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.3.203, exceeds the actual or 
hypothetical loss for that day.  
 
8.3.156 
When a Reporting Bank excludes an exception pursuant to paragraph 8.3.155, 
the Reporting Bank must document the historical movement of the value of the relevant 
NMRF and the evidence that the NMRF caused the relevant loss. 
 
8.3.157 
A Reporting Bank must classify its backtesting results into 3 zones according to 
the number of exceptions counted pursuant to paragraphs 8.3.154 and 8.3.155, in 
accordance with Table 8-22.

8.3.158 
For a Reporting Bank in the backtesting amber zone or the backtesting red zone, 
as classified in accordance with paragraph 8.3.157, the Reporting Bank must apply the 
backtesting add-on as set out in Table 8-22 when calculating its aggregate capital 
requirement for market risks in accordance with paragraph 8.3.243. If the Authority 
determines that there are severe problems with the integrity of the Reporting Bank’s 
internal models or if the Reporting Bank is in the backtesting red zone, the Authority may 
disallow the Reporting Bank’s use of the IMA for market risk capital requirements. 
 
 
Backtesting at the trading desk level 
 
8.3.159 
A Reporting Bank must conduct backtesting of each trading desk risk 
management model on a daily basis. 
 
8.3.160 
A Reporting Bank must conduct backtesting at the trading desk level by 
comparing the one-day VaR measure at both the 97.5th percentile and 99th percentile, one-
tailed confidence levels, against each of the APL and against each of the HPL, of each 
trading desk registered in a day over 250 trading days prior to each date on which 
backtesting is conducted. A Reporting Bank must ensure that the one-day VAR measure 
is calibrated to a one-day holding period and to the most recent 250 trading days’ data.  
 
8.3.161 
A Reporting Bank must count the number of exceptions under the backtesting 
conducted in paragraph 8.3.160 as follows:  
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank must count each observation when either the actual 
loss or the hypothetical loss of the trading desk registered in a day of the 
backtesting period exceeds the corresponding daily VaR measure given by 
the Reporting Bank’s internal model;  
 
(b) 
in the event that either the P&L or the daily VaR measure is not available 
or impossible to calculate for a given day over the 250 trading days prior 
to the current reporting date, the Reporting Bank must count this as an 
exception;  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-127 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must count exceptions for actual losses separately 
from exceptions for hypothetical losses, and count the overall number of 
exceptions as the greater of these 2 amounts.  
 
8.3.162 
For the purposes of counting the number of exceptions in paragraph 8.3.161, 
subject to the Authority’s written approval, a Reporting Bank may exclude an exception if 
the Reporting Bank has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Authority that the 
exception was caused by a NMRF, and the stress scenario capital requirement for that 
NMRF for that trading desk, which is calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.3.203, 
exceeds the actual or hypothetical loss for that day. The Reporting Bank must calculate 
the stress scenario capital requirement for the NMRF for the specific trading desk.  
 
8.3.163 When the Reporting Bank excludes an exception pursuant to paragraph 8.3.162, 
the Reporting Bank must document the historical movement of the value of the relevant 
NMRF and the evidence that the NMRF caused the relevant loss. 
 
8.3.164 
If a Reporting Bank counts, for a trading desk, either more than 30 exceptions 
when compared against the one-day VaR measure at the 97.5th percentile, one-tailed 
confidence level, or more than 12 exceptions when compared against the one-day VaR 
measure at the 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence level, over 250 trading days prior to 
each date on which backtesting is conducted, the Reporting Bank must determine the 
market risk capital requirement for all of the positions in that trading desk using the 
SA(MR).  
 
 
PLA test requirements 
 
8.3.165 
A Reporting Bank must perform the PLA test for each trading desk that is in-
scope of the IMA.  The Reporting Bank must ensure that the PLA test for each trading desk 
is performed on a standalone basis, with no recognition of diversification or hedging effects 
with any position outside the trading desk.  
 
8.3.166 
A Reporting Bank must perform the PLA test for each trading desk by comparing 
the RTPL with the daily HPL for each trading desk763 over the 250 trading days prior to 
each reporting date.  
 
 
PLA test data input alignment 
 
8.3.167 
A Reporting Bank may adjust the RTPL input data for its risk factors to align 
with the data used in HPL for the purposes of the PLA test in accordance with paragraph 
8.3.168, provided that the Reporting Bank meets all of the following requirements: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the HPL input data can be used for 
RTPL purposes, and that neither risk factor differences nor valuation 
 
763  
The objective of the PLA test is to determine if there is a significant degree of association between the HPL 
and RTPL for each trading desk, so as to assess whether the risk factors included and the valuation engines 
used in the trading desk risk management model of the trading desk captures the material drivers of the 
P&L. A Reporting Bank’s HPL and RTPL for each trading desk can differ for a number of reasons. However, 
a Reporting Bank’s trading desk risk management model for each trading desk should provide a reasonably 
accurate assessment of the risks of a trading desk to be deemed eligible for the IMA.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-128 
engine differences are omitted when transforming HPL input data into a 
format which can be applied to the risk factors used in RTPL calculation; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must document and validate any adjustment of RTPL 
input data, and be able to justify any adjustment of RTPL input data to the 
satisfaction of the Authority, at the request of the Authority;  
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must have procedures in place to identify changes to 
the adjustments of RTPL input data. The Reporting Bank must notify the 
Authority of any adjustment of RTPL input data and any change to such 
adjustments within 7 business days of such changes; 
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank must perform assessments on the effect these 
adjustments to the input data would have on the RTPL and the PLA test. 
To do so, the Reporting Bank must compare RTPL based on HPL-aligned 
market data with the RTPL based on market data without alignment. The 
Reporting Bank must perform this comparison when designing or changing 
the input data alignment process, and provide the assessment to the 
Authority upon request. 
 
8.3.168  Subject to paragraph 8.3.167, a Reporting Bank may make adjustments to the 
RTPL input data when the input data for a given risk factor that is included in both the 
RTPL and the HPL differs due to different providers of market data sources, different time 
fixing of market data sources, or transformations of market data into input data for the 
risk factor in the underlying pricing model. The Reporting Bank may adjust the RTPL input 
data either by – 
 
(a)  directly replacing the RTPL input data with the HPL input data764; 
 
(b)  using the HPL input data as a basis to calculate the risk factor data needed 
in the RTPL765; or 
 
(c) 
aligning the time of the RTPL input data to the time of the HPL input data, 
in cases where the trading desk of the Reporting Bank operates in a 
different time zone compared to the time zone for the location of the 
Reporting Bank’s risk control department.   
 
8.3.169 
If a Reporting Bank uses market data in the calculation of HPL in a different 
manner from in the calculation of RTPL, the Reporting Bank must reflect these differences 
in the PLA test and in the calculation of HPL and RTPL.  
 
8.3.170 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.3.168, where a Reporting Bank transforms 
market data into input data for a risk factor in an underlying pricing model, the Reporting 
Bank may adjust the market data used in RTPL to align with the market data used in HPL, 
before the transformation of the market data by the Reporting Bank, but not after the 
transformation of the market data.  
 
 
764  
For example, a Reporting Bank may replace the RTPL input data with the HPL input data in cases where 
the RTPL and HPL use input data for the same GIRR risk factor, but from different data providers. 
765  
For example, a Reporting Bank may use HPL input data relating to a GIRR risk factor, which is a par rate, 
as a basis to determine the RTPL input data relating to another GIRR risk factor, which is a zero rate of the 
same tenor. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-129 
8.3.171 
A Reporting Bank must not – 
 
(a)  adjust the HPL input data for risk factors to align with the RTPL input data; 
and  
 
(b)  adjust HPL or RTPL to address residual operational noise arising from 
calculating HPL and RTPL in 2 different systems at 2 different points in 
time766. 
 
 
PLA test metrics 
 
8.3.172 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the following test metrics for each trading desk 
using the time series of the most recent 250 trading days of observations of HPL and RTPL: 
 
(a) 
the Spearman correlation metric, in accordance with paragraph 8.3.173, 
to assess the correlation between HPL and RTPL; 
 
(b) 
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test metric, in accordance with paragraph 
8.3.174, to assess similarity of the distributions of HPL and RTPL. 
 
8.3.173 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the Spearman correlation metric using the 
following steps: 
 
(a) 
step 1: for a time series of HPL, produce a corresponding time series of 
ranks (RHPL) based on ascending order of HPL (i.e. the lowest value in the 
HPL time series receives a rank of 1, the next lowest value receives a rank 
of 2 and so on); 
 
(b) 
step 2: similarly, for a time series of RTPL, produce a corresponding time 
series of ranks (RRTPL) based on ascending order of RTPL; 
 
(c) 
step 3: calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient of the 2 time series 
RRTPL and RHPL using the following formula: 
 
rs = 
cov(RHPL, RRTPL) 
σRHPL x σRRTPL 
 
where –  
 
(i)  
σRHPL and σRRTPL are the standard deviations of RHPL and RRTPL; and 
 
(ii)  cov(RHPL, RRTPL) is the covariance between RHPL and RRTPL. 
 
 
 
 
766  
Residual operational noise may originate from – 
(a)  transitioning large portions of data across systems, where potential data aggregations may result in 
minor reconciliation gaps below tolerance levels for intervention;  
(b)  small differences in static or reference data; or  
(c) 
differences in the configurations of the systems. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-130 
8.3.174 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the KS test metric using the following steps:  
 
(a) 
step 1: calculate the empirical cumulative distribution function of HPL. For 
any value of HPL, the empirical cumulative distribution is the product of 
0.004 and the number of HPL observations that are less than or equal to 
the corresponding HPL; 
 
(b) 
step 2: calculate the empirical cumulative distribution function of RTPL. 
For any value of RTPL, the empirical cumulative distribution is the product 
of 0.004 and the number of RTPL observations that are less than or equal 
to the corresponding RTPL; 
 
(c) 
step 3: calculate the KS test metric by taking the largest absolute 
difference observed between the 2 empirical cumulative distribution 
functions calculated in steps 1 and 2 at any P&L value. 
 
8.3.175 
A Reporting Bank must assign each trading desk to a PLA test red zone, amber 
zone or green zone, based on the Spearman correlation metric and the KS test metric, in 
accordance with the following steps, and as set out in Table 8-23: 
 
(a) 
assign a trading desk to the PLA test green zone if both of the following 
conditions are met: 
 
(i) 
the Spearman correlation metric is above 0.8;  
 
(ii) 
the KS test metric is below 0.09; 
 
(b) 
assign a trading desk to the PLA test red zone if either of the following 
conditions are met: 
 
(i) 
the Spearman correlation metric is below 0.7;  
 
(ii) 
the KS test metric is above 0.12; 
 
(c) 
assign a trading desk to the PLA test amber zone if it is not assigned to 
the green zone or red zone.

A Reporting Bank must treat a trading desk that is in the PLA test red zone as 
ineligible to use the IMA to determine market risk capital requirements, and hence out-of-
scope of the IMA.  
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-131 
8.3.177 
A Reporting Bank must continue to treat a trading desk as ineligible to use the 
IMA, and hence out-of-scope of the IMA, until – 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank performs the PLA test for the trading desk in 
accordance with paragraphs 8.3.165 to 8.3.174 for a reporting date, and 
is required to assign the trading test to the PLA test green zone in 
accordance with paragraph 8.3.175; and 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank conducts backtesting in accordance with paragraphs 
8.3.159 to 8.3.162 for the same reporting date referred to in sub-
paragraph (a), and the Reporting Bank counts, for the trading desk – 
 
(i) 
less than or equal to 30 exceptions when compared against the one-
day VaR measure at the 97.5th percentile, one-tailed confidence level; 
and 
 
(ii) 
less than or equal to 12 exceptions when compared against the one-
day VaR measure at the 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence level,  
 
  
over 250 trading days prior to the reporting date. 
 
8.3.178 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must not treat a trading desk that is in the 
PLA test amber zone as out-of-scope of the IMA. 
 
8.3.179 
For a trading desk that has been assigned to the PLA test amber zone, a 
Reporting Bank must not assign the trading desk to the PLA test green zone until – 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank performs the PLA test for the trading desk in 
accordance with paragraphs 8.3.165 to 8.3.174 for a reporting date, and 
is required to assign the trading test to the PLA test green zone in 
accordance with paragraph 8.3.175; and 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank conducts backtesting in accordance with paragraphs 
8.3.159 to 8.3.162 for the same reporting date referred to in sub-
paragraph (a), and the Reporting Bank counts, for the trading desk, –  
 
(i)  
less than or equal to 30 exceptions when compared against the one-
day VaR measure at the 97.5th percentile, one-tailed confidence level; 
and  
 
(ii)  less than or equal to 12 exceptions when compared against the one-
day VaR measure at the 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence level,  
 
over 250 trading days prior to the reporting date. 
 
8.3.180 
A Reporting Bank must apply a capital surcharge to trading desks in the PLA 
test amber zone in accordance with paragraph 8.3.243. 
 
 
 
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

Sub-division 5: Calculation of IMA Capital Requirements 
 
8.3.181 
For each trading desk that is determined to be in-scope of the IMA in accordance 
with paragraph 8.3.17, a Reporting Bank must determine market risk capital requirements 
in respect of the trading desk – 
 
(a) 
using ES models, in accordance with paragraphs 8.3.182 to 8.3.202, for 
all modellable risk factors; and 
 
(b) 
using SES models, in accordance with paragraphs 8.3.203 to 8.3.212, for 
all non-modellable risk factors. 
 
 
Calculation of expected shortfall for modellable risk factors  
 
8.3.182 
A Reporting Bank must calculate ES on a daily basis, and at a 97.5th percentile, 
one-tailed confidence level, for the Reporting Bank’s IMA portfolio and for each trading 
desk that is in-scope of the IMA.  
 
8.3.183 
Subject to prior written approval by the Authority, a Reporting Bank need not 
require all products to be simulated using full revaluation and may use simplifications767 
in its internal models. The Authority will consider if the method used by the Reporting 
Bank is adequate for the instruments covered prior to granting approval. 
 
8.3.184 
A Reporting Bank must calculate ES by scaling an ES calculated on a base 
liquidity horizon of 10 days to reflect the liquidity horizons specified in paragraph 8.3.196,

where –  
 
(a) 
ES = regulatory liquidity-adjusted ES; 
 
(b) 
T = 10 days (length of the base liquidity horizon); 
 
(c) 
𝐄𝐒𝐓(𝐏) = ES at horizon T of a portfolio with positions 𝐏= (𝐩𝒊) with respect 
to shocks to all risk factors that the positions P are exposed to, calculated 
over the time interval T without scaling from a shorter horizon; 
 
(d) 𝐄𝐒𝐓(𝐏, 𝐣) = ES at horizon T of a portfolio with positions 𝐏= (𝐩𝒊) with 
respect to shocks for each position pi to the subset of risk factors 𝐐(𝐏𝐢 , 𝐣),

8.3.185 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the ES measure in a period of stress in 
accordance with paragraphs 8.3.186 to 8.3.191, such that the ES measure replicates an 
ES outcome that would be generated on the Reporting Bank’s current portfolio if all the 
modellable risk factors in the Reporting Bank’s ES model were subject to a period of stress.  
 
8.3.186 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the ES measure in a period of stress using a 
reduced set of risk factors.  The Reporting Bank must ensure that the reduced set of risk 
factors satisfies all of the following conditions: 
 
(a) 
the reduced set of risk factors must be relevant for the Reporting Bank’s 
IMA portfolio; 
 
(b) 
there must be a sufficiently long history of observations for the reduced 
set of risk factors that spans back to and includes 2007; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must seek the Authority’s approval for its choice of 
the reduced set of risk factors; 
 
(d) 
the reduced set of risk factors must meet the data quality requirements 
for a modellable risk factor set out in paragraphs 8.3.108 to 8.3.137; 
 
(e) 
the ES measure based on the reduced set of risk factors must be, on 
average, at least equal to 75% of the ES measure based on the full set of 
risk factors at the IMA portfolio level for the aggregate of all trading desks 
that are in-scope of the IMA, over the 12-week period preceding the 
calculation date.  
 
8.3.187 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its internally modelled capital requirement at 
the IMA portfolio level using the Reporting Bank’s ES model, with no supervisory 
constraints on cross-risk class correlations (𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂)), by using the following formula:  
 
768  
For example, 𝐐(𝐏𝐢 ,𝟒) would contain risk factors with liquidity horizons, which are at least as long as 60 
days. This would include risk factors with liquidity horizons, which are at least as long as 120 days, which 
are contained in 𝐐(𝐏𝐢 , 𝟓). To avoid doubt, 𝐐(𝐏𝐢 , 𝐣), is a subset of 𝐐(𝐏𝐢 ,𝐣−𝟏). 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂) = 𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐒× 𝐦𝐚𝐱(𝐄𝐒𝐅,𝐂
𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐂
, 𝟏) 
 
where – 
 
(a) 𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐒 is the ES measure calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.3.184, 
using only the reduced set of risk factors specified by the Reporting Bank 
in accordance with paragraph 8.3.186, based on the most severe 250 
trading day period of stress over the observation horizon identified in 
accordance with paragraph 8.3.188 and taking into account stressed 
correlation measures across the reduced set of risk factors; 
 
(b) 𝐄𝐒𝐅,𝐂 is the ES measure calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.3.184, 
using the full set of risk factors, based on the most recent 250 trading day 
observation period; and 
 
(c) 
𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐂 is the ES measure calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.3.184, 
using only the reduced set of risk factors specified by the Reporting Bank 
in accordance with paragraph 8.3.186, based on the most recent 250 
trading day observation period. 
 
8.3.188 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.3.187(a), a Reporting Bank must identify the 
most severe 250 trading day period of stress during which the Reporting Bank’s IMA 
portfolio experiences the largest loss, available over an observation horizon, where – 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the observation horizon for 
determining the most severe 250 trading day period of stress, at a 
minimum, spans back to and includes 2007; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the observations are equally 
weighted; and 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the aggregate capital requirement 
for modellable risk factors (IMCC) calculated based on the 250 trading day 
period of stress in accordance with paragraph 8.3.200 is the maximum 
value possible.  
 
8.3.189 
For the purposes of calculating 𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐒, a Reporting Bank must update the 250 
trading day period of stress identified in accordance with paragraph 8.3.188 at least 
quarterly, and whenever there are material changes in the risk factors of its portfolio. The 
Reporting Bank must also update the reduced set of risk factors specified by the Reporting 
Bank in accordance with paragraph 8.3.186 whenever it updates the 250 trading day 
period of stress, for the purposes of calculating 𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐒 and 𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐂. 
 
8.3.190 
For the purposes of calculating 𝐄𝐒𝐅,𝐂, a Reporting Bank must update its data 
sets at least quarterly, and must also reassess its data sets whenever market prices are 
subject to material changes. The Reporting Bank must ensure that its updating process is 
able to allow for updates on an ad hoc basis. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-135 
8.3.191 
The Authority may require a Reporting Bank to calculate 𝐄𝐒𝐅,𝐂 using a shorter 
observation period of at least 6 months if the Authority is of the opinion that a shorter 
observation period is justified by a significant increase in price volatility. 
 
8.3.192 
When a new benchmark rate is able to meet the data quality requirements for 
a modellable risk factor set out in paragraphs 8.3.108 to 8.3.137, but did not exist during 
a period of stress, the Reporting Bank may, for the purposes of calculating 𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂) in 
paragraph 8.3.187, use –  
 
(a)  for the most recent 250 trading day observation period, the new 
benchmark rate in the full set of risk factors (𝐄𝐒𝐅,𝐂), and in the reduced 
set of risk factors (𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐂); and 
 
(b)  for the stressed period, the old benchmark rate in the reduced set of risk 
factors (𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐒). 
 
To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the reduced set of risk factors meets 
the conditions specified in paragraph 8.3.186(c) and (d). 
 
8.3.193 
A Reporting Bank may use any type of ES model769, as long as the ES model 
satisfies the requirements set out in this Part.  
 
8.3.194 
A Reporting Bank may recognise empirical correlations within risk classes 
(namely interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk and credit 
spread risk), including related option volatilities in each risk class. The Reporting Bank 
may only recognise empirical correlations across risk classes in accordance with 
paragraphs 8.3.199 to 8.3.202. Where the Reporting Bank recognises empirical 
correlations across risk classes, the Reporting Bank must calculate and use these 
correlations in a manner consistent with the applicable liquidity horizons, clearly document 
the use of these correlations, and be able to justify the use of these correlations to the 
Authority upon request. 
 
8.3.195 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its internal models accurately capture the 
risks associated with options within each risk class. The Reporting Bank must ensure that 
– 
 
(a) 
its internal models capture the non-linear price characteristics of options 
positions; and 
 
(b) 
its risk measurement systems have a set of risk factors that captures the 
volatilities of the rates and prices underlying options positions (i.e. vega 
risk). The Reporting Bank must model the volatility surface across both 
strike price and tenor. The Reporting Bank must also have detailed 
specifications of the relevant volatilities if it has a large or complex options 
portfolio. 
 
8.3.196 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.3.184, a Reporting Bank must calculate the 
liquidity horizon, n, for each risk factor, in accordance with all of the following: 
 
769  
For example, models based on historical simulation, Monte Carlo simulation, or other appropriate analytical 
methods.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-136 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must map each of its risk factors to one of the risk 
factor categories in Table 8-25. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the 
procedures for mapping the risk factors are – 
 
(i) 
set out in writing; 
 
(ii) 
validated by the Reporting Bank’s risk management function; 
 
(iii) made available to the Authority upon request; and 
 
(iv) subject to internal audit; 
  
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank may, subject to written approval by the Authority, 
increase the liquidity horizon above the values set out in Table 8-25 for 
particular trading desks. Where the Reporting Bank increases the liquidity 
horizon for a particular trading desk, the increased horizon must be set as 
20, 40, 60 or 120 days, capped at the maturity of the related instrument. 
The Reporting Bank must also document the rationale for increasing the 
liquidity horizon; 
  
 
(c) 
for risk factors in instruments that mature before the liquidity horizon of 
the respective risk factor as set out in Table 8-25, the Reporting Bank 
must assign to the risk factor the shortest liquidity horizon (out of 10, 20, 
40, 60 or 120 days) that is equal to or longer than the maturity of the 
instrument770; 
  
  
(d) 
for credit and equity indices where different risk factor categories are 
involved, the Reporting Bank must assign to the risk factor the shortest 
liquidity horizon (out of 10, 20, 40, 60 and 120 days) that is equal to or 
longer than the weighted average liquidity horizon of the index, where the 
weighted average liquidity horizon is calculated by multiplying the liquidity 
horizon of each of the underlying instruments of the index by its weight in 
the index, and summing across all underlying instruments771; 
  
 
(e) 
the Reporting Bank must assign the same liquidity horizons to inflation 
risk factors and interest rate risk factors of the same currency. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
770  
For example, although the liquidity horizon for interest rate volatility is prescribed as 60 days, if an 
instrument matures in 30 days, the Reporting Bank must assign a 40-day liquidity horizon to the 
instrument’s interest rate volatility.  
771  
For example, if the weighted average liquidity horizon is 12 days, the Reporting Bank must assign a liquidity 
horizon of 20 days to the index.

Calculation of capital requirement for modellable risk factors 
 
8.3.197 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its internally modelled capital requirement at 
the IMA portfolio level using its ES model, with no supervisory constraints on cross-risk 
class correlations (𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂)), in accordance with paragraph 8.3.187.  
 
772  
To avoid doubt, the liquidity horizon of 10 days applies to mono-currency and cross-currency basis risk in 
the specified currencies.  
773  
To avoid doubt, the liquidity horizon of 20 days applies to mono-currency and cross-currency basis risk in 
currencies other than EUR, USD, GBP, AUD, JPY, SEK, CAD and SGD.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-138 
 
8.3.198 
A Reporting Bank must include in its ES model all modellable risk factors for 
trading desks that are in-scope of the IMA. 
 
8.3.199 
A Reporting Bank must calculate a series of partial ES capital requirements for 
each risk class (namely interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity 
risk and credit spread risk), holding risk factors for other risk classes constant. The 
Reporting Bank must calculate the partial ES capital requirement for the risk class 𝐢 
(𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂𝐢)), by using the following formula: 
 
𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂𝐢) = 𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐒,𝐢× 𝐦𝐚𝐱(𝐄𝐒𝐅,𝐂,𝐢
𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐂,𝐢
, 𝟏) 
 
where – 
 
(a) 𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐒,𝐢 is the ES measure calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.3.184, 
using only the reduced set of risk factors specified by the Reporting Bank 
in accordance with paragraph 8.3.186 and holding risk factors for other 
risk classes constant, based on the most severe 250 trading day period of 
stress over the observation horizon identified in accordance with 
paragraph 8.3.188; 
 
(b) 𝐄𝐒𝐅,𝐂,𝐢 is the ES measure calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.3.184, 
using the full set of risk factors and holding risk factors for other risk 
classes constant, based on the most recent 250 trading day observation 
period; and 
 
(c) 
𝐄𝐒𝐑,𝐂,𝐢 is the ES measure calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.3.184, 
using only the reduced set of risk factors specified by the Reporting Bank 
in accordance with paragraph 8.3.186 and holding risk factors for other 
risk classes constant, based on the most recent 250 trading day 
observation period. 
 
8.3.200 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its aggregate capital requirement for 
modellable risk factors (IMCC), using either the following formula or the formula set out 
in paragraph 8.3.201: 
 
𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂=  𝛒(𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂)) + (𝟏−𝛒) (∑𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂𝐢)
𝐁
𝐢=𝟏
) 
 
where – 
 
(a) 
the stress period used in the risk class level must be the same as that 
used to calculate the IMA portfolio-wide ES;  
 
(b) 𝛒 is 0.5; 
 
(c) 
B stands for the risk classes as specified in paragraph 8.3.199, namely 
interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk and 
credit spread risk; 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-139 
 
(d) 𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂)  is the unconstrained ES capital requirement as specified in 
paragraph 8.3.197; and 
 
(e) 𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂𝐢) is the partial ES capital requirement as specified in paragraph 
8.3.199. 
 
8.3.201 
A Reporting Bank may choose to calculate its aggregate capital requirement for 
modellable risk factors (IMCC) using the following formula774: 
 
𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂= (𝛒+ (𝟏−𝛒) × (∑
𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂𝐢))
𝐁
𝐢=𝟏
(𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂))
) × (𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂)) 
 
where –  
 
(a) 𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂)  is the unconstrained ES capital requirement as specified in 
paragraph 8.3.187 and is calculated daily; and 
 
(b) 
(∑
𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂𝐢))
𝐁
𝐢=𝟏
(𝐈𝐌𝐂𝐂(𝐂))
 is calculated weekly. 
 
8.3.202 
A Reporting Bank that chooses to use the formula in paragraph 8.3.201 to 
calculate IMCC must have procedures and controls in place to ensure that the weekly 
calculation of the ratio in paragraph 8.3.201(b) does not lead to a systematic 
underestimation of risks relative to a daily calculation of the ratio, and must be in a position 
to switch to a daily calculation of the ratio within 7 business days, upon request by the 
Authority. 
 
 
Calculation of capital requirement for NMRFs 
 
8.3.203 
A Reporting Bank must calculate a stress scenario capital requirement for each 
NMRF, where the stress scenario capital requirement for each NMRF is the loss that is 
incurred when the NMRF is subject to a 250 trading day period of stress.  The Reporting 
Bank must ensure that the stress scenario capital requirement for each NMRF, calculated 
using a 250 trading day period of stress, is at least as high as the ES for each NMRF, which 
is calculated at a 97.5th percentile, one-tailed confidence level, over the same 250 trading 
day period of stress. 
 
8.3.204 
For the purposes of calculating the stress scenario capital requirement for each 
NMRF pursuant to paragraph 8.3.203, a Reporting Bank must determine a common 250 
trading day period of stress across all NMRFs in the same risk class.  
 
8.3.205 
Despite paragraph 8.3.204, subject to prior written approval from the Authority, 
a Reporting Bank may calculate stress scenario capital requirements for NMRFs at the 
bucket level for risk factors that belong to curves, surfaces or cubes, using the same 
buckets that the Reporting Bank uses for the purposes of the risk factor eligibility test 
based on the bucketing approach adopted by the Reporting Bank pursuant to in paragraph 
8.3.117. 
 
774  
The specified formula reduces the number of ES measures that a Reporting Bank needs to calculate. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-140 
 
8.3.206 
A Reporting Bank must assign a liquidity horizon to each NMRF that is the 
greater of the liquidity horizon assigned to the risk factor in accordance with paragraph 
8.3.196 and 20 days. The Authority may require the Reporting Bank to apply a higher 
liquidity horizon to any NMRF.  
 
8.3.207 
Despite paragraph 8.3.204, a Reporting Bank may apply a common 250 trading 
day period of stress to all NMRFs arising from idiosyncratic credit spread risk that is 
different from the 250 trading day period of stress for NMRFs arising from non-idiosyncratic 
credit spread risk, and a common 250 trading day period of stress to all NMRFs arising 
from idiosyncratic equity risk arising from spot, futures and forward prices, equity repo 
rates, dividends and volatilities that is different from the 250 trading day period of stress 
for NMRFs arising from non-idiosyncratic equity risk. 
 
8.3.208 
A Reporting Bank may assume zero correlation when aggregating gains and 
losses for the NMRFs arising from the idiosyncratic risk factors referred to in paragraph 
8.3.207, provided that the Reporting Bank conducts analysis and demonstrates to the 
satisfaction of the Authority that this is appropriate775.  
 
8.3.209 
A Reporting Bank must recognise correlation or diversification effects between 
non-idiosyncratic NMRFs in accordance with the formula in paragraph 8.3.212.  
 
8.3.210 
A Reporting Bank must ensure the period of stress determined in accordance 
with paragraphs 8.3.203 and 8.3.207 is acceptable to the Authority.  
 
8.3.211 
In the event that a Reporting Bank is unable to provide a period of stress which 
is acceptable to the Authority, the Reporting Bank must use the maximum possible loss 
as the stress scenario. 
 
8.3.212 
A Reporting Bank must calculate SES, the aggregate regulatory capital measure 
for I (non-modellable idiosyncratic credit spread risk factors that have been aggregated 
with zero correlation in accordance with paragraphs 8.3.207 and 8.3.208), J (non-
modellable idiosyncratic equity risk factors that have been aggregated with zero 
correlation in accordance with paragraphs 8.3.207 and 8.3.208) and the remaining K (non-
modellable risk factors in trading desks that are in-scope of the IMA), by using the 
following formula: 
 
𝑺𝑬𝑺= √∑𝑰𝑺𝑬𝑺𝑵𝑴,𝒊

775  
Such analysis generally involves tests on the residuals of panel regressions where the dependent variable 
is the change in issuer spread, while the independent variables can be either a change in a market factor 
or a dummy variable for sector or region or both. The assumption is that the data on the names used to 
estimate the model suitably proxies the names in the portfolio and the idiosyncratic residual component 
captures the multifactor-name basis. If the model is missing systematic explanatory factors or the data 
suffers from measurement error, then the residuals would exhibit one or some of the following: 
heteroscedasticity (which can be tested via White, Breuche Pagan tests etc), serial correlation (which can 
be tested with Durbin Watson, Lagrange multiplier (LM) tests etc), or cross-sectional correlation (clustering).

Calculation of default risk capital requirement 
 
8.3.213 
A Reporting Bank must have a separate internal default risk capital (DRC) 
requirement model to measure the default risk of trading book positions.  
 
8.3.214 
For the purposes of this Division, default risk is the risk of – 
 
(a)  direct loss due to a reference entity’s default; and  
 
(b) 
the potential for indirect losses that may arise from in the event of default 
of a reference entity,  
 
where a reference entity refers to the issuer in the case of a bond or equity, or an obligor 
in the case of other credit obligations.  
 
8.3.215  The Reporting Bank must ensure that its DRC requirement model satisfies the 
general criteria in paragraphs 8.3.2 to 8.3.21 and the qualitative standards in paragraphs 
8.3.22 to 8.3.86. 
 
8.3.216 
A Reporting Bank must subject all trading book positions subject to market risk 
capital requirements that have default risk, with the exception of positions subject to the 
SA(MR), to the DRC requirement model. To avoid doubt, trading book positions include –  
 
(a)  all exposures to central governments, central banks and PSEs, including 
those denominated in the domestic currency of a country or jurisdiction;  
 
(b)  all equity positions; and 
 
(c)  all defaulted debt positions.  
 
8.3.217  For the purposes of paragraph 8.3.216(b), a Reporting Bank must model the 
default of an issuer as the equity price of the issuer dropping to zero. 
 
8.3.218 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its default risk measure using a VaR model, as 
VaR at the 99.9th percentile, one-tailed confidence level, based on a one-year time horizon. 
The Reporting Bank must calculate its default risk measure weekly. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-142 
 
8.3.219 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.3.218, a Reporting Bank must use a default 
simulation model with 2 types of systematic risk factors. The Reporting Bank must define 
the random variable that determines whether an entity defaults as an entity-specific 
function of multiple systematic factors of 2 different types, and of an idiosyncratic factor776. 
 
8.3.220 
A Reporting Bank must calculate default correlations for the default risk model 
based on credit spread or listed equity price data, that cover a period of at least 10 years, 
and which includes a period of stress identified in accordance with paragraph 8.3.188. The 
Reporting Bank must not include data sources other than credit spreads or listed equity 
prices777 for the purposes of calculating default correlations. 
 
8.3.221 
A Reporting Bank must calculate default correlations for its default risk model 
based on a one-year liquidity horizon. The Reporting Bank may apply a liquidity horizon 
of 60 days, or a longer period where appropriate778, to –  
 
(a) 
equity positions; and 
 
(b) 
equity sub-portfolios, provided that the Reporting Bank calculates the 
default risk of the equity sub-portfolios separately and the trading desks 
to which positions in the equity sub-portfolios are assigned deal 
predominantly in equity exposures.  
 
To avoid doubt, if a trading desk has both equity and bond exposures, and the bank 
performs a joint calculation for the default risk of equities and bonds, the Reporting Bank 
must calculate default correlations based on a one-year liquidity horizon. 
 
8.3.222 
A Reporting Bank must have clear policies and procedures on the process for 
calculating default correlations, and must document the cases in which credit spreads or 
equity prices are used. 
 
8.3.223 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its DRC requirement as the greater of – 
 
(a) 
the average of the default risk measures over the most recent 12 weeks; 
or 
 
(b) 
the most recent default risk measure, 
 
as of the date of calculation, where the default risk measure is derived based on the DRC 
requirement model and in accordance with paragraphs 8.3.213 to 8.3.222 and paragraphs 
8.3.224 to 8.3.240.

For example, in a Merton-type model, entity 𝒊 defaults when its asset return 𝑿𝒊 falls below an entity-specific 
threshold that determines the entity’s probability of default. Systematic risk may be described via 𝑴 
systematic regional factors 𝒀𝒋
𝒓𝒆𝒈𝒊𝒐𝒏(𝒋= 𝟏, … , 𝑴) and 𝑵 systematic industry factors 𝒀𝒋
𝒊𝒏𝒅𝒖𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒚(𝒋= 𝟏, … , 𝑵). For

𝒓𝒆𝒈𝒊𝒐𝒏 and industry factor loadings 
𝜷𝒊,𝒋
𝒊𝒏𝒅𝒖𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒚that describe the sensitivity of the entity’s asset return to each systematic factor, such that there 
is at least one non-zero factor loading for the region type and at least one non-zero factor loading for the

For example, rating time series. 
778  
For example, where equity is held to hedge hybrid positions such as convertibles.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore

8.3.224 
A Reporting Bank must assume constant positions over the liquidity horizon 
applied for each position pursuant to paragraph 8.3.221. For instruments with a maturity 
shorter than the applied liquidity horizon, the Reporting Bank must account for the 
maturity of any long or short position when the ability to maintain a constant position 
within the liquidity horizon cannot be contractually assured.  
 
8.3.225 
A Reporting Bank must measure default risk for each reference entity.  
 
8.3.226 
A Reporting Bank must not use probabilities of default (PDs) implied from 
market prices, unless they are corrected to obtain an objective probability of default. The 
Reporting Bank must subject PDs to a floor of 0.03%. 
 
8.3.227 
A Reporting Bank may reflect offsetting of long and short exposures to the same 
reference entity in its DRC requirement model. If such exposures span different 
instruments with exposure to the same reference entity, the Reporting Bank must ensure 
that the effect of the offsetting accounts for different losses in the different instruments779.  
 
8.3.228 
A Reporting Bank must explicitly model the basis risk between long and short 
exposures of different reference entities, and must include the ability to offset default risk 
among long and short exposures across different reference entities through the modelling 
of defaults. The Reporting Bank must not offset positions before they are input into the 
DRC requirement model, except where specified in paragraph 8.3.227. 
 
8.3.229 
A Reporting Bank must recognise in its DRC requirement model the impact of 
correlations between defaults among obligors, including the effect on correlations of 
periods of stress. The Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
base the correlations on objective data, and must not choose the 
correlations such that a higher correlation is used for portfolios with a mix 
of long and short positions and a low correlation is used for portfolios with 
only long exposures; 
 
(b) 
validate that its modelling approach for the correlations is appropriate for 
its portfolio, including the choice and weights of its systematic risk factors; 
 
(c) 
document its modelling approach and the time period used to calibrate the 
model; 
 
(d) 
measure the correlations over a liquidity horizon as applied pursuant to 
paragraph 8.3.221; 
 
(e) 
calibrate the correlations based on data covering a period of at least 10 
years; and 
 
(f) 
reflect all significant basis risks in recognising the correlations780.  
 
8.3.230 
A Reporting Bank must capture any material mismatch between a position and 
its hedge in its DRC requirement model. With respect to default risk within the one-year 
capital horizon, the Reporting Bank must ensure that its DRC requirement model accounts 
 
779  
For example, due to differences in seniority of the instruments.  
780  
For example, maturity mismatches, internal or external ratings, or vintage.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-144 
for the risk in the timing of defaults, to capture the relative risk from the maturity 
mismatch of long and short positions with maturity of less than one year. 
 
8.3.231 
A Reporting Bank must reflect the effect of issuer and market concentrations, 
and concentrations that can arise within and across product classes during stressed 
conditions, in its DRC requirement model. 
 
8.3.232 
As part of a Reporting Bank’s DRC requirement model, the Reporting Bank must 
calculate, for each position subject to the model, an incremental loss amount relative to 
the current valuation that the Reporting Bank would incur in the event that the reference 
entity of the position defaults. 
 
8.3.233 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its DRC requirement model reflects the 
economic cycle in its loss estimates781.  
 
8.3.234 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its DRC requirement model reflects the non-
linear impact of options, and other positions with material non-linear behaviour, with 
respect to default. Subject to prior written approval by the Authority, the Reporting Bank 
may apply simplified modelling approaches 782 to only equity derivative positions with 
multiple underlyings. 
 
8.3.235 
A Reporting Bank must assess default risk from the perspective of the 
incremental loss from default, in excess of the mark-to-market losses already taken into 
account in the current valuation. 
 
8.3.236 
A Reporting Bank must conduct validation of its DRC requirement model to 
assess its qualitative and quantitative reasonableness, particularly with regard to the 
model’s treatment of concentrations783. The Reporting Bank must ensure that tests to 
validate the model are not limited to the range of events experienced historically.   
 
8.3.237 
Where a Reporting Bank seeks written approval from the Authority to use the 
IMA for a trading desk with exposure to both credit spread risk and default risk, the 
Reporting Bank must seek approval to use the IMA to determine market risk capital 
requirements for both credit spread risk and default risk for that trading desk. The 
Reporting Bank must treat trading desks which do not receive approval as out-of-scope of 
the IMA. 
 
8.3.238 
A Reporting Bank must establish a hierarchy ranking its preferred sources for 
PD and loss-given-default (LGD) estimates and must not cherry-pick model parameters. 
 
8.3.239 
Where a Reporting Bank has approved PD estimates as part of the IRBA, the 
Reporting Bank must use this data for the purposes of the DRC requirement model. In all 
 
781  
For example, by incorporating the dependence of the recovery on the systematic risk factors. 
782  
For example, modelling approaches that rely solely on individual jump-to-default sensitivities to estimate 
losses when multiple underlyings default.  
783  
Owing to the high confidence standard and long capital horizon of the DRC requirement, robust direct 
validation of the DRC requirement model through standard backtesting methods at the 99.9%/one-year 
soundness standard will not be possible. Accordingly, validation of a DRC requirement model would 
necessarily rely more heavily on indirect methods including but not limited to stress tests, sensitivity 
analyses and scenario analyses. The Reporting Bank should develop relevant internal modelling 
benchmarks to assess the overall accuracy of their DRC requirement model.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-145 
other cases, the Reporting Bank must calculate PDs using a methodology consistent with 
the IRBA, and must satisfy all of the following conditions: 
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank must not use risk-neutral PDs as estimates of 
observed historical PDs; 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank must measure PDs based on historical default data 
including both formal default events and price declines equivalent to 
default losses784, over a minimum historical observation period of 5 years; 
 
(c)  the Reporting Bank must estimate PDs based on historical data of default 
frequency over a one-year period. The Reporting Bank may also calculate 
PD on a theoretical basis785 provided that the Reporting Bank is able to 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority, that such theoretical 
derivations are in line with historical default experience; 
 
(d)  the Reporting Bank may use PDs provided by external sources, provided 
the Reporting Bank ensures that they are relevant for the Reporting Bank’s 
portfolio. 
 
8.3.240 
Where a Reporting Bank has approved LGD estimates as part of the IRBA, the 
Reporting Bank must use this data for the purposes of the DRC requirement model. In all 
other cases, the Reporting Bank must calculate LGDs using a methodology consistent with 
the IRBA, and must satisfy all of the following conditions: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must determine LGDs based on a position’s current 
market value less the position’s expected market value subsequent to 
default. The Reporting Bank must measure LGD as (1 – recovery rate) and 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the LGD reflects the type and 
seniority of the position, and is not less than zero; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must estimate LGDs based on an amount of historical 
data that is sufficient to derive robust, accurate estimates; 
 
(c)  the Reporting Bank may use LGDs provided by external sources, provided 
the Reporting Bank ensures that they are relevant for the Reporting Bank’s 
portfolio. 
 
 
Calculation of capital requirement for trading desks that are out-of-scope of the 
IMA 
 
8.3.241 
A Reporting Bank must calculate 𝑪𝒖, the capital requirement for trading desks 
that are out-of-scope of the IMA using the SA(MR). To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank 
must ensure that all positions held on trading desks that are out-of-scope of the IMA, 
including positions that are held by trading desks that were nominated to be out-of-scope 
of the IMA pursuant to paragraph 8.3.6, are combined for the purposes of determining 
capital requirements using the SA(MR). 
 
784  
Where possible, a Reporting Bank should base this data on publicly traded securities over a complete 
economic cycle. 
785  
For example, using geometric scaling.

and 
 
(ii) 
𝒎𝒒 is the qualitative add-on determined by the Authority786.  
 
8.3.243 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the aggregate capital requirement for market 
risk, 𝑨𝑪𝑹𝒕𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍, by using the following formula: 
 
𝑨𝑪𝑹𝒕𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍= 𝒎𝒊𝒏{𝑰𝑴𝑨𝑮,𝑨+ 𝑪𝑺+ 𝑪𝑼 , 𝑺𝑨𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒅𝒆𝒔𝒌} + 𝒎𝒂𝒙{𝟎, 𝑰𝑴𝑨𝑮,𝑨−𝑺𝑨𝑮,𝑨} 
 
where – 
 
(a) 𝑰𝑴𝑨𝑮,𝑨= 𝑪𝑨+ 𝑪𝑫𝑹𝑪 is the aggregate capital requirement for trading desks 
that are approved and eligible for IMA; 
 
(b) 𝑪𝑨 is the aggregate capital requirement for market risks excluding DRC, 
for trading desks that are approved and eligible for the IMA calculated in 
accordance with paragraph 8.3.242;

Sub-division 6: Transitional arrangements 
 
8.3.246 
For the period from 1 January 2025 to 31 Dec 2025 (both dates inclusive) 
(referred to in this Sub-division as the “transition period”) –  
 
(a)  paragraphs 8.3.176 and 8.3.177 do not apply. A Reporting Bank using the 
IMA may apply the IMA to determine the market risk capital requirements 
for each trading desk that meets the requirements set out in paragraph 
8.3.17(a) and (b), regardless of the zone the trading desk is assigned to; 
and 
 
(b)  paragraph 8.3.180 does not apply.  
 
8.3.247 
During the transition period, a Reporting Bank using the IMA must, in its ICAAP, 
ensure that it maintains sufficient capital for market risk, taking into account the PLA test 
results.  
 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore

Division 4: SSA(MR) 
 
Sub-division 1: General Requirements 
 
8.4.1 
A Reporting Bank using the SSA(MR) must calculate its market risk capital 
requirement in accordance with the requirements set out in this Division. 
 
8.4.2 
A Reporting Bank that uses the SSA(MR) to calculate its market risk capital 
requirements must calculate its market risk capital requirements under the SSA(MR) using 
the following formula: 
 
𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠= (𝐶𝑅𝐼𝑅𝑅× 1.3) + (𝐶𝑅𝐸𝑄× 3.5) + (𝐶𝑅𝐹𝑋× 1.2) + (𝐶𝑅𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑀× 1.9) 
 
where – 
 
(a) 𝐶𝑅𝐼𝑅𝑅 = aggregate of capital requirements for interest rate risk calculated 
in accordance with paragraphs 8.4.3 to 8.4.25, and capital requirements 
for options pertaining to debt and for options pertaining to interest rate-
related instruments, calculated in accordance with paragraphs 8.4.62 to 
8.4.85; 
 
(b) 𝐶𝑅𝐸𝑄 = aggregate of capital requirements for equity risk calculated in 
accordance with paragraphs 8.4.26 to 8.4.40, and capital requirements 
for options pertaining to equity-related instruments calculated in 
accordance with paragraphs 8.4.62 to 8.4.85; 
 
(c) 𝐶𝑅𝐹𝑋 = aggregate of capital requirements for foreign exchange risk 
calculated in accordance with paragraphs 8.4.41 to 8.4.49, and capital 
requirements 
for 
options 
pertaining 
to 
foreign 
exchange-related 
instruments and for options pertaining to gold, calculated in accordance 
with paragraphs 8.4.62 to 8.4.85; and 
 
(d) 𝐶𝑅𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑀 = aggregate of capital requirements for commodity risk calculated 
in accordance with paragraphs 8.4.50 to 8.4.61, and capital requirements 
for options pertaining to commodity-related instruments calculated in 
accordance with paragraphs 8.4.62 to 8.4.85. 
 
 
Sub-division 2: Interest Rate Risk 
 
8.4.3 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its market risk capital requirement for interest 
rate risk by –  
 
(a)  identifying the positions in its trading book which have interest rate risk; 
 
(b)  allocating the positions into individual currency portfolios;  
 
(c)  for each currency portfolio –  
 
(i) 
calculating the net positions in accordance with paragraphs 8.4.11 
to 8.4.14;  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-150 
 
(ii) 
including these net positions in the calculation of its specific risk 
capital requirement after applying any offsets allowed under 
paragraph 8.4.15; and 
 
(iii) including these net positions in the calculation of its general market 
risk capital requirement; and 
 
(d)  summing all specific risk and general market risk capital requirements for 
each currency portfolio. 
 
 
Scope 
 
8.4.4 
In calculating its market risk capital requirement for interest rate risk, a 
Reporting Bank must include all its trading book positions787 within the scope of application 
set out in Sub-Division 2 of Division 1 of this Part, whether such positions are long or short, 
in instruments (including derivatives and off-balance sheet instruments) whose market 
values are affected by changes in interest rates. A Reporting Bank must ensure that such 
instruments include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 
(a) 
fixed rate and floating rate debt securities;  
 
(b) 
traded mortgage securities and mortgage derivative products, even 
though these carry the risk of prepayment; 
 
(c) 
non-convertible preference shares; 
 
(d) 
convertible securities which are traded like debt securities;  
 
(e) 
bond futures, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps, forward rate 
agreements, and forwards including foreign exchange forwards. 
 
8.4.5 
A Reporting Bank, in calculating its market risk capital requirement for interest 
rate risk under this Sub-division, must not include a position in any of the following: 
 
(a) 
a convertible security which is traded like an equity;  
 
(b)  an option or a position hedging an option, which is caught under Sub-
division 6 of this Division, except where the Reporting Bank is required 
under that Sub-division to include the delta-weighted position in this Sub-
division. 
 
8.4.6 
For the purposes of paragraphs 8.4.4, 8.4.5, 8.4.28, 8.4.29 and 8.4.30 – 
 
(a)  “convertible security” means a debt issue or preference share which is 
convertible at a stated price into ordinary shares of the issuer; and 
 
 
787 
To avoid doubt, this includes positions in any interest rate-related instrument that is sold or lent under an 
SFT, but excludes any interest rate-related instrument that is bought or borrowed under an SFT.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-151 
(b)  a Reporting Bank must treat a “convertible security” as debt if it is traded 
like debt securities, and as equity if it is traded like equity. In the case 
where a convertible security is treated as debt, the Reporting Bank must 
include the position in the convertible security in calculating its market 
risk capital requirement for interest rate risk. In the case where a 
convertible security is treated as equity, the Reporting Bank must include 
the position in the convertible security in calculating its market risk capital 
requirement for equity risk. 
 
 
Measurement of Positions with Interest Rate Risk 
 
8.4.7 
Except for any interest rate-related derivative referred to in paragraph 8.4.8 
and any credit derivative referred to in paragraph 8.4.9, a Reporting Bank must use the 
current market value of the principal amount of its positions in interest rate-related 
instruments to calculate its market risk capital requirement for interest rate risk. 
 
8.4.8 
A Reporting Bank must convert its interest rate-related derivatives into notional 
positions in the relevant underlying instruments in accordance with Annex 8C and use the 
current market value of the principal amount of the underlying instruments to calculate its 
market risk capital requirement for interest rate risk.  
 
8.4.9 
A Reporting Bank must convert its credit derivatives into notional positions in 
the relevant reference obligations in accordance with Annex 8D and use the current market 
value of the principal amount of the reference obligations to calculate its market risk capital 
requirement for interest rate risk, except in the case of credit linked notes, where the 
Reporting Bank must use the current market value of the notes.  
 
8.4.10 
In determining the value of the positions or notional positions, a Reporting Bank 
must use the valuation of the relevant position with reference to readily observable market 
prices788 or, for contracts for which there are no readily observable market prices, the 
Reporting Bank must base the valuation on appropriate valuation models or discounted 
cash flows using market quoted rates. The Reporting Bank must also ensure that the 
valuation it uses meets the standards set out in Annex 6C. For instruments where the 
apparent notional amount differs from the effective notional amount, the Reporting Bank 
must use the effective notional amount in determining the market value.  
 
 
Allowable Offsetting of Matched Positions  
 
8.4.11 
For the purposes of calculating the specific risk and general market risk capital 
requirements for its positions in interest rate-related instruments, or notional positions in 
interest rate-related derivatives, a Reporting Bank may offset –  
 
(a)  a long and a short position, including any notional position, in an identical 
issue789; or  
 
 
788  
Examples are prices quoted by exchanges or dealers. 
789 
To avoid doubt, no offsetting is permitted between different issues, even where the issuer is the same, 
since differences in coupon rates, liquidity, call features, etc. mean that prices may diverge in the short 
run.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-152 
(b)  a matched position in – 
 
(i)  
a futures contract; or  
 
(ii)  a forward,  
 
and its corresponding underlying exposures or underlying instruments. To 
avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must include the position representing 
the time to expiry of a futures contract or forward in the calculation of the 
market risk capital requirements. 
 
8.4.12 
Where a Reporting Bank applies the offsetting in accordance with paragraph 
8.4.11, the Reporting Bank must calculate the net position as the difference between the 
value of the long positions of the Reporting Bank (including notional positions) in a security 
and the value of its short positions (including notional positions) in the same security. 
 
8.4.13 
Where a futures contract or forward comprises a range of deliverable debt 
securities, a Reporting Bank may offset a short position in the futures contract or forward 
and a long position in the corresponding “cheapest-to-deliver” underlying security only 
where the Reporting Bank has sold the futures contract or forward and the “cheapest-to-
deliver” underlying security is identifiable and the Reporting Bank is able to deliver it. 
 
8.4.14 
A Reporting Bank may offset opposite positions in the same category of interest 
rate-related instruments (including the delta-equivalent value of options and the separate 
legs of different swaps) if –  
 
(a) 
the positions relate to the same underlying instruments;  
 
(b) 
the positions are of the same notional value; and 
 
(c) 
the positions are denominated in the same currency;  
 
and –  
 
(i)  
in the case of futures contracts, the offsetting positions in the notional or 
underlying instrument to which the futures contract relates are for 
identical products and mature within 7 days of each other; 
 
(ii)  in the case of swaps and FRAs, the reference rates for floating rate 
positions are identical and the coupons are within 15 basis points; and 
 
(iii)  in the case of swaps, FRAs and forwards, the next interest fixing dates or, 
for fixed coupon positions or forwards, the residual maturities are as 
follows: 
 
(A)  on the same day as each other, if the period between the next 
interest fixing date and the time of calculation, or the residual 
maturity as of the time of calculation, is less than one month; 
 
(B)  within 7 days of each other, if the period between the next interest 
fixing date and the time of calculation, or the residual maturity as of 
the time of calculation, is between one month and one year;  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-153 
 
(C)  within 30 days of each other, if the period between the next interest 
fixing date and the time of calculation, or residual maturity as of the 
time of calculation, is more than a year. 
 
 
Allowable Offsets for Positions Hedged by Credit Derivatives  
 
8.4.15 
For the purposes of calculating the specific risk capital requirement for a credit 
derivative and its hedged position, a Reporting Bank may –  
 
(a)  apply a full offset when the values of the 2 legs (i.e. long and short) always 
move in opposite directions and broadly to the same extent. This would 
be the case when –  
 
(i)  
the 2 legs consist of completely identical instruments; or 
 
(ii)  a long cash position is hedged by a total return swap (or vice versa) 
and there is an exact match between the reference obligation of the 
total return swap and the long cash position790; 
 
(b)  after taking into account any restrictive payout provisions791 applicable to 
the hedged position and the credit derivative, apply an 80% offset to the 
side of the transaction with the higher specific risk capital requirement and 
a zero specific risk capital requirement on the other side when the values 
of the 2 legs always move in opposite directions but not broadly to the 
same extent. This would be the case when –  
 
(i)  
a long cash position or credit derivative (referred to in this paragraph 
as the “initial derivative”), as the case may be, is hedged by a credit 
default swap or a credit linked note (or vice versa);  
 
(ii)  there is an exact match in terms of –  
 
(A)  the long cash position or the reference obligation of the initial 
derivative, as the case may be (such long cash position or 
reference obligation of the initial derivative is referred to in this 
paragraph as the “underlying instrument”), and the reference 
obligation of the credit default swap or credit linked note, as 
the case may be; 
 
(B)  the maturity of the long cash position or initial derivative, as 
the case may be, and the credit default swap or credit linked 
note, as the case may be; and 
 
(C)  the currency of the long cash position or initial derivative, as 
the case may be, and the credit default swap or credit linked 
note, as the case may be; and  
 
 
790 
The maturity of the total return swap may be different from that of the long cash position. 
791  
Examples of restrictive payout provisions are fixed payouts and materiality thresholds below which no 
payment will be made.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-154 
(iii)  the key features of the credit default swap or credit linked note792, 
as the case may be, do not cause its price movement to materially 
deviate from the price movement of the long cash position or initial 
derivative, as the case may be; and 
 
(c)  apply the higher of the 2 specific risk capital requirements when the values 
of the 2 legs usually move in opposite directions. This would be the case 
when –  
 
(i)  
the position would have been captured in sub-paragraph (a)(ii) but 
for an asset mismatch between the reference obligation of the total 
return swap and the long cash position where –  
 
(A)  the reference obligation of the total return swap ranks pari 
passu with or is junior to the long cash position; and  
 
(B)  the long cash position and reference obligation of the total 
return swap share the same obligor and legally enforceable 
cross-default or cross acceleration clauses are in place; 
 
(ii)  the position would have been captured in sub-paragraph (a)(i) or (b) 
but for a mismatch in maturities referred to in sub-paragraph 
(b)(ii)(B) or a mismatch in currencies referred to in sub-paragraph 
(b)(ii)(C); or 
 
(iii)  the position would have been captured in sub-paragraph (b) but for 
an asset mismatch between – 
 
(A)  the underlying instrument; and  
 
(B)  the reference obligation of the credit default swap or credit 
linked note, as the case may be,  
 
and the underlying instrument is included in the deliverable 
obligations in the documentation of the credit default swap or credit 
linked note, as the case may be. 
 
8.4.16 
Where there is a mismatch in currencies referred to in paragraph 8.4.15(c)(ii), 
a Reporting Bank must treat the foreign exchange risk arising from the currency mismatch 
in accordance with Sub-division 4 of this Division. 
 
8.4.17 
A Reporting Bank must calculate a specific risk capital requirement for both the 
credit derivative and the hedged position if paragraph 8.4.15 does not apply to them. 
 
 
 
 
 
792  
Examples are credit event definitions, settlement mechanisms. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-155 
Specific Risk Capital Requirement 
 
8.4.18 
Except for notional positions in zero-specific risk securities793, that do not attract 
specific risk, a Reporting Bank must calculate the specific risk capital requirement794 for 
each net position in an interest rate-related instrument795 or a credit derivative, including 
the net delta-weighted position of options on that interest rate-related instrument or credit 
derivative where the Reporting Bank is using the delta-plus method or the scenario 
approach to calculate its market risk capital requirement for options, by –  
 
 
(a)  in the case of a securitisation exposure, multiplying the market value of 
each net position (ignoring the sign) by the relevant specific risk charge. 
The Reporting Bank must calculate the specific risk charge as the risk 
weight that would apply to the securitisation exposure if the Reporting 
Bank were to hold it in the banking book, as determined by paragraph 
7.1.14(b)(iii), in accordance with the hierarchy of approaches determined 
by paragraphs 7.6.13 to 7.6.19, divided by 12.5, and converting the 
resultant amount into the reporting currency of the Reporting Bank at 
prevailing foreign exchange spot rates; 
 
(b)  in the case of a credit derivative and its hedged position for which the 
Reporting Bank has applied an offset pursuant to paragraph 8.4.15, 
multiplying the market value of the resulting net position (ignoring the 
sign) by the relevant specific risk charge in accordance with Table 8E-1, 
and converting this amount into the reporting currency of the Reporting 
Bank at prevailing foreign exchange spot rates;  
 
(c)  in the case of a CTP, using the larger of – 
 
(i) 
the aggregate of each of the net long positions from the net long 
correlation trading exposures multiplied by the relevant specific risk 
charge in accordance with the relevant table of Annex 8E, and 
converting this amount into the reporting currency of the Reporting 
Bank at prevailing foreign exchange spot rates; and  
 
(ii) 
the aggregate of each of the net short positions from the net short 
correlation trading exposures multiplied by the relevant specific risk 
charge in accordance with the relevant table of Annex 8E, and 
converting this amount into the reporting currency of the Reporting 
Bank at prevailing foreign exchange spot rates;  
 
and  
 
 
(d)  in all other cases, multiplying the market value of each net position 
(ignoring the sign) by the relevant specific risk charge in accordance with 
Table 8E-1, and converting this amount into the reporting currency of the 
Reporting Bank at prevailing foreign exchange spot rates. 
 
793  
Examples are interest rate and currency swaps, FRAs, forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate 
futures and futures on an interest rate index. 
794  
The specific risk capital requirement is intended to protect against an adverse movement in the price of an 
individual instrument owing to factors related to the individual issuer. 
795 
This includes both actual and notional positions (e.g. futures contracts where the underlying is a debt 
security or an index representing a basket of debt securities).  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-156 
 
8.4.19 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the maximum possible loss for each individual 
position796. Despite paragraph 8.4.18, the Reporting Bank may limit the specific risk capital 
requirement for an individual position in a credit derivative or securitisation instrument to 
the maximum possible loss. 
 
 
 
  General Market Risk Capital Requirement 
 
8.4.20 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the general market risk capital requirement797 
for each currency portfolio by –  
 
(a)  applying either the maturity method or the duration method to calculate 
the general market risk capital requirement in the foreign currency; and 
 
(b)  converting the resultant amount into the reporting currency of the 
Reporting Bank at prevailing foreign exchange spot rates. 
 
The Reporting Bank must sum up the absolute value of the general market risk capital 
requirements for each currency portfolio, across all its currency portfolios.  
 
 
Maturity Method798 
 
8.4.21 
A Reporting Bank applying the maturity method must –  
 
(a)  slot each net position (including the net delta-weighted position of options 
on interest rate-related instruments where the Reporting Bank is using the 
delta-plus method to calculate its market risk capital requirement for 
options) into the appropriate maturity band according to the maturity and 
coupon of the instrument in accordance with Table 8E-2799; 
 
(b)  calculate the weighted long and short positions for each maturity band by 
multiplying the net positions by the corresponding general risk charge in 
accordance with Table 8E-2; 
 
(c)  match the weighted long and short positions within –  
 
(i)  
the same maturity band; 
 
(ii)  the same zone (using unmatched positions from sub-paragraph 
(c)(i)); and 
 
 
796  
For a short position, a Reporting Bank may calculate this limit as a change in value due to the underlying 
names immediately becoming default risk-free. For a long position, the Reporting Bank may calculate the 
maximum possible loss as the change in value in the event that all the underlying names were to default 
with zero recoveries. 
797  
The general market risk capital requirement for interest rate risk is intended to capture the risk of loss 
arising from changes in market interest rates. 
798  
An illustration on the calculation of the general market risk capital requirement for interest rate risk under 
the maturity method is set out in Annex 8F. 
799  
A Reporting Bank should allocate fixed rate instruments according to the residual term to maturity and 
floating rate instruments according to the residual term to the next repricing date. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-157 
(iii)  different zones (using unmatched positions from sub-paragraph 
(c)(ii)); 
 
(d)  calculate the maturity band requirement, by multiplying the total amount 
matched within each maturity band by the maturity band matching factor 
in accordance with Table 8E-4; 
 
(e)  calculate the zone requirement, by multiplying the total amount matched 
within each zone by the corresponding zone matching factor in accordance 
with Table 8E-4; 
 
(f)  calculate the adjacent zone requirement, by multiplying the total amount 
matched between adjacent zones by the adjacent zone matching factor in 
accordance with Table 8E-4;  
 
(g)  calculate the non-adjacent zone requirement, by multiplying the total 
amount matched between Zones 1 and 3 and the non-adjacent zone 
matching factor in accordance with Table 8E-4;  
 
(h)  calculate the net position requirement as the sum of all unmatched 
amounts after complying with sub-paragraphs (c) to (g); and 
 
 
(i)  
calculate the general market risk capital requirement as the sum of the 
maturity band requirement, the zone requirement, the adjacent zone 
requirement, the non-adjacent zone requirement and net position 
requirement determined in accordance with sub-paragraphs (d) to (h). 
 
8.4.22 
A Reporting Bank must use separate slotting tables for each currency, except 
in respect of those currencies in which the business of the Reporting Bank is insignificant. 
For currencies in which the business of the Reporting Bank is insignificant, the Reporting 
Bank may construct a single maturity ladder and slot, within each appropriate maturity 
band, the net long or short position for each currency. The Reporting Bank must calculate 
the individual weighted net long and short positions for each maturity band by multiplying 
the net positions by the corresponding risk charges in accordance with Table 8E-2. The 
Reporting Bank must sum the weighted net positions within each maturity band, 
irrespective of whether they are long or short positions, to produce a gross position figure. 
The Reporting Bank must then apply the treatment specified in paragraph 8.4.21(d) to (i) 
to calculate the general market risk capital requirement for these currencies. 
 
 
Duration Method 
 
8.4.23 
A Reporting Bank may, having put in place the necessary IT systems and with 
prior written approval from the Authority, apply the duration method to measure general 
market risk by calculating the price sensitivity of each position separately. A Reporting 
Bank which elects to use this method must use this method to measure general market 
risk unless a change in method is approved by the Authority. 
 
8.4.24 
A Reporting Bank applying the duration method must –  
 
(a)  calculate the price sensitivity of each position based on either one of the 
following:  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore

(ii) 
by adopting an alternative calculation methodology that has been 
approved by the Authority in writing;  
 
(b)  perform slotting by –  
 
(i)  
where the Reporting Bank applies sub-paragraph (a)(i), slotting 
each net position (including the net delta-weighted position of 
options on interest rate-related instruments where the Reporting 
Bank is using the delta-plus method to calculate its market risk 
capital requirement for options) into the appropriate duration band 
based on the modified duration of the position, in accordance with 
Table 8E-3; or  
 
(ii)  
where the Reporting Bank applies sub-paragraph (a)(ii), slotting the 
sensitivity measures of each net position (including the sensitivity 
measures of the net delta-weighted position of options on interest 
rate-related instruments where the Reporting Bank is using the 
delta-plus method to calculate its market risk capital requirement 
for options) into the appropriate duration band based on the tenor 
of the interest rate risk factor applied to calculate the price 
sensitivity of the position, in accordance with Table 8E-3; 
 
(c)  calculate the weighted long and short positions for each duration band by 
–   
 
(i) 
where the Reporting Bank applies sub-paragraph (a)(i), multiplying 
the net positions by the modified duration of the position derived in 
sub-paragraph (a)(i) and the relevant assumed change in yield in 
accordance with Table 8E-3; or 
 
(ii) 
where the Reporting Bank applies sub-paragraph (a)(ii), multiplying 
the sensitivity measures of the net positions by the relevant assumed 
change in yield in accordance with Table 8E-3;  
 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-159 
(d)  match the weighted long and short positions within –  
 
(i)  
the same duration band; 
 
(ii)  the same zone (using unmatched positions from sub-paragraph 
(d)(i)); and 
 
(iii)  different zones (using unmatched positions from sub-paragraph 
(d)(ii)); 
 
 
 
(e)  calculate the duration band requirement, by multiplying the total amount 
matched within each duration band by the duration band matching factor 
in accordance with Table 8E-4; 
 
(f)  calculate the zone requirement, by multiplying the total amount matched 
within each zone by the respective zone matching factor in accordance 
with Table 8E-4; 
 
(g)  calculate the adjacent zone requirement, by multiplying the total amount 
matched between adjacent zones by the adjacent zone matching factor in 
accordance with Table 8E-4; 
 
(h)  calculate the non-adjacent zone requirement, by multiplying the total 
amount matched between Zones 1 and 3 and the non-adjacent zone 
matching factor in accordance with Table 8E-4;  
 
(i)  
calculate the net position requirement as the sum of all unmatched 
amounts after complying with sub-paragraphs (d) to (h); and 
 
(j)  calculate the general market risk capital requirement as the sum of the 
duration band requirement, the zone requirement, the adjacent zone 
requirement, the non-adjacent zone requirement and the net position 
requirement determined in accordance with sub-paragraphs (e) to (i). 
 
8.4.25 
A Reporting Bank must use separate slotting tables for each currency, except 
in respect of those currencies in which the business of the Reporting Bank is insignificant. 
For currencies in which the business of the Reporting Bank is insignificant, the Reporting 
Bank may construct a single maturity ladder and slot, within each appropriate duration 
band, the net long or short position for each currency. The Reporting Bank must calculate 
the individual weighted net long and short positions for each duration band by multiplying 
the net positions by the corresponding assumed change in yield in accordance with Table 
8E-3. The Reporting Bank must sum the weighted net positions within each duration band, 
irrespective of whether they are long or short positions, to produce a gross position figure. 
The Reporting Bank must then apply the treatment specified in paragraph 8.4.24(e) to (j) 
to calculate the general market risk capital requirement for these currencies.  
 
 
Sub-division 3: Equity Risk 
 
8.4.26 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its market risk capital requirement for equity 
risk by –  
 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-160 
(a)  identifying the positions in its trading book which have equity risk; 
 
(b)  allocating the positions into country or jurisdiction portfolios in accordance 
with paragraph 8.4.27; 
 
(c)  for each country or jurisdiction portfolio –  
 
(i)  
calculating the net position in each equity, equity basket or equity 
index in accordance with paragraph 8.4.33; and 
 
(ii)  including these net positions in the calculation of its specific risk and 
general market risk capital requirements; and 
 
(d)  summing all specific risk and general market risk capital requirements for 
each country or jurisdiction portfolio. 
 
8.4.27 
A Reporting Bank must group equity positions into country or jurisdiction 
portfolios as follows: 
 
(a)  a position in an individual equity belongs to –  
 
(i)  
the country or jurisdiction of its primary listing; or 
 
(ii)  where it is unlisted, the country or jurisdiction of issue; and 
 
(b)  a position in an equity basket or equity index is allocated to –  
 
(i)  
one or more country or jurisdiction portfolios based on the countries 
or jurisdictions to which the underlying equities belong under sub-
paragraph (a); or 
 
(ii)  a hypothetical country or jurisdiction. 
 
 
Scope 
 
8.4.28 
In calculating its market risk capital requirement for equity risk, a Reporting 
Bank must include all its trading book positions800 within the scope of application set out 
in Sub-Division 2 of Division 1 of this Part, whether such positions are long or short, in 
instruments (including derivatives and off-balance sheet instruments) whose market 
values are affected by changes in equity prices, unless the position is an option or a 
position hedging an option, which is caught under Sub-division 6 of this Division, except 
where the Reporting Bank is required under that Sub-division to include the delta-weighted 
position in this Sub-division. 
 
8.4.29 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.4.28, “instruments whose market values are 
affected by changes in equity prices” include ownership interests, whether voting or non-
voting, convertible securities that trade like equity, commitments to buy or sell equities, 
and derivatives on individual equities and on equity indices.  
 
800 
To avoid doubt, this includes positions in any equity instrument that is sold or lent under an SFT, but 
excludes any equity that is bought or borrowed under an SFT.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-161 
 
8.4.30 
For the purposes of paragraphs 8.4.28 and 8.4.29, a Reporting Bank must treat 
a convertible security in accordance with paragraph 8.4.6(b) and include the position in 
calculating its market risk capital requirement for equity risk if the convertible security is 
treated as equity. 
 
 
Measurement of Positions with Equity Risk 
 
8.4.31 
Except for equity derivatives referred to in paragraph 8.4.32, a Reporting Bank 
must use the current market value of its positions in equity instruments to calculate its 
market risk capital requirement for equity risk.  
 
8.4.32 
A Reporting Bank must convert its equity derivatives into notional positions in 
the relevant underlying instruments in accordance with Annex 8G and use the current 
market value of the underlying instruments to calculate its market risk capital requirement 
for equity risk.  
 
 
Allowable Offsetting of Matched Positions 
 
8.4.33 
For the purposes of calculating the specific risk and general market risk capital 
requirements for its equity positions, a Reporting Bank may offset –  
 
(a)  a long position and a short position, including notional positions, in an 
identical equity, equity basket or equity index in the same country or 
jurisdiction portfolio; and  
 
(b)  a matched position in a depository receipt against the corresponding 
underlying equity or identical equities in different country or jurisdiction 
portfolios provided that any costs of conversion are fully taken into 
account. The Reporting Bank must include any foreign exchange risk 
arising out of these positions in calculating its market risk capital 
requirements for foreign exchange risk under Sub-division 4 of this 
Division. 
 
8.4.34 
Where a Reporting Bank applies the offsetting in accordance with paragraph 
8.4.33, the Reporting Bank must calculate the net position as the difference between the 
value of the long positions of the Reporting Bank (including notional positions) in a security 
and the value of its short positions (including notional positions) in the same security. 
 
8.4.35 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.4.33, a Reporting Bank must treat 2 equities 
as identical if they enjoy the same rights in all respects and are fungible. 
 
 
Specific Risk Capital Requirement 
 
8.4.36 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the specific risk capital requirement for each 
net position in an equity instrument, including the net delta-weighted position of options 
on that equity instrument where the Reporting Bank is using the delta-plus method or the 
scenario approach to calculate its market risk capital requirement for options, by –  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-162 
 
(a)  converting the value of the net position into the reporting currency of the 
Reporting Bank at prevailing foreign exchange spot rates; and 
 
(b)  multiplying the resultant amount by the appropriate specific risk charge 
as follows:  
 
(i) 
any qualifying equity index (as defined in Annex 8H) – 0%; or 
 
(ii) 
any other equity, equity basket or equity index – 8%. 
 
 
General Market Risk Capital Requirement 
 
8.4.37 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the general market risk capital requirement 
for each country or jurisdiction portfolio by –  
 
(a)  calculating the net position in each country or jurisdiction portfolio by 
summing the net positions of equities, equity baskets and equity indices 
in the same country or jurisdiction portfolio, including the net delta-
weighted positions of options on equities and options on equity indices 
where the Reporting Bank is using the delta-plus method to calculate its 
market risk capital requirement for options; 
 
(b)  converting the net position in each country or jurisdiction portfolio into the 
reporting currency of the Reporting Bank at prevailing foreign exchange 
spot rates; and 
 
(c)  multiplying the resultant amount (ignoring the sign) by a general risk 
charge of 8%. 
 
 
Additional Market Risk Capital Requirement for Qualifying Equity Indices 
 
8.4.38 
In addition to the general market risk capital requirement, a Reporting Bank 
must apply an additional risk charge of 2% to the net long or short position in a qualifying 
equity index (as defined in Annex 8H)801. 
 
 
Treatment of Arbitrage Strategies 
 
8.4.39 
In the case of the futures-related arbitrage strategies described below, a 
Reporting Bank must apply an additional 2% risk charge to only one index with the 
opposite position exempt from the market risk capital requirement. Such futures-related 
arbitrage strategies are –  
 
(a)  where the Reporting Bank takes an opposite position in exactly the same 
index at different dates or in different market centres; or 
 
 
801  
This is intended to cover factors such as execution risk. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-163 
(b)  where the Reporting Bank takes an opposite position in contracts at the 
same date in a different but similar index, subject to approval by the 
Authority. The Authority will not normally grant approval for a Reporting 
Bank to use this treatment unless the Reporting Bank is able to 
demonstrate that the 2 indices contain sufficient common components to 
justify offsetting. 
 
8.4.40 
Where a Reporting Bank engages in a deliberate arbitrage strategy in which a 
futures contract on a broadly-based index matches a basket of stocks, the Reporting Bank 
may exclude both positions for the purposes of calculating its specific risk and general 
market risk capital requirements, on condition that –  
 
(a)  the trades have been deliberately entered into and are separately 
controlled; and 
 
(b)  the composition of the basket of stocks represents at least 90% of the 
index when broken down into its underlying components. 
 
In such a case, the Reporting Bank must apply a risk charge of 4%, with 2% on the gross 
value of the positions on each side, to reflect divergence and execution risks, even if all of 
the stocks comprising the index are held in identical proportions. The Reporting Bank must 
treat any excess value of the stocks comprising the basket over the value of the futures 
contract or excess value of the futures contract over the value of the basket as an open 
long or short position. 
 
 
Sub-division 4: Foreign Exchange Risk 
 
8.4.41 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its market risk capital requirement for foreign 
exchange risk by –  
 
(a)  identifying the positions which have foreign exchange risk; 
 
(b)  calculating the net open position in each currency in accordance with 
paragraphs 8.4.45 to 8.4.48, and the net gold position in accordance with 
paragraphs 8.4.50 and 8.4.55; 
 
(c)  converting the net open position in each currency and the net gold position 
into the reporting currency of the Reporting Bank at prevailing foreign 
exchange spot rates;  
 
(d)  computing the overall net open position by aggregating –  
 
(i)  
the absolute value of the sum of the net short currency positions or 
the sum of the net long currency positions, whichever is greater; and 
 
(ii)  the absolute value of the net position (long or short) in gold; and  
 
(e)  multiplying the overall net open position by 8%. 
 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-164 
8.4.42 
Despite paragraph 8.4.41, a Reporting Bank doing negligible business in foreign 
currency and which does not take foreign exchange positions for its own account may, 
subject to the prior approval of the Authority, be exempted from market risk capital 
requirements on these positions provided that –  
 
(a)  its foreign currency business, defined as the greater of the sum of its gross 
long positions and the sum of its gross short positions in all foreign 
currencies, does not exceed 100% of its Eligible Total Capital; and 
 
(b) 
its overall net open position as defined in paragraph 8.4.41 does not 
exceed 2% of its Eligible Total Capital. 
 
 
Scope 
 
8.4.43 
In calculating its market risk capital requirement for foreign exchange risk, a 
Reporting Bank must include all positions within the scope of application set out in Sub-
division 2 of Division 1 of this Part, in gold and in foreign currency-denominated 
instruments, regardless of whether these are in the trading book or banking book, unless 
–  
 
(a)  the position is hedging a position which is deducted in the calculation of 
CET1 Capital, AT1 Capital or Tier 2 Capital, and excluded from market risk 
capital requirements in accordance with paragraph 8.1.6; or 
 
(b)  the position is an option or a position hedging an option, which is caught 
under Sub-division 6 of this Division, except where the Reporting Bank is 
required under that Sub-division to include the delta-weighted position in 
this Sub-division. 
 
8.4.44 
Despite paragraph 8.4.43(b), a Reporting Bank must calculate a market risk 
capital requirement for foreign exchange risk for option premiums that are denominated 
in a foreign currency.  
 
 
Measurement of Positions with Foreign Exchange Risk 
 
8.4.45 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its net open position in each currency by 
summing –  
 
(a)  the net spot position, which is all asset items less all liability items, 
including accrued interest and accrued expenses, denominated in the 
currency in question; 
 
(b)  the net forward position, which is all amounts to be received less all 
amounts to be paid under forward foreign exchange transactions, 
including currency futures and the principal on currency swaps not 
included in the spot position; 
 
(c)  guarantees and other similar instruments denominated in foreign currency 
which are certain to be called and are likely to be irrecoverable; 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-165 
 
(d)  future income or expenses included pursuant to paragraph 8.4.47; 
 
(e)  depending on particular accounting conventions in different countries or 
jurisdictions, any other item representing a profit or loss in foreign 
currencies; and 
 
(f)  the net delta-weighted position of foreign currency options where the 
Reporting Bank is using the delta-plus method to calculate its market risk 
capital requirement for options. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must 
separately calculate market risk capital requirements for gamma and vega 
for foreign currency options in accordance with paragraphs 8.4.69 to 
8.4.77.   
 
8.4.46 
Despite paragraph 8.4.45, where a Reporting Bank is assessing its foreign 
exchange risk on a consolidated basis, and the inclusion of certain foreign exchange 
positions may be impractical802, the Reporting Bank may use the internal limit in each 
currency as a proxy for the positions, provided the Reporting Bank monitors ex-post the 
actual positions against such limits daily. The Reporting Bank must add the absolute values 
of the limits to the net open position in each currency. 
 
8.4.47 
A Reporting Bank may include future income and expenses in the calculation of 
its net open position if these are certain and have been hedged and the Reporting Bank 
applies such inclusion consistently. To avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must not include 
only the future income and expenses that would reduce its net open position. 
 
8.4.48  
A Reporting Bank must allocate its positions in composite currencies to –  
 
(a)  one or more currency portfolios based on their component parts on a 
consistent basis; or 
 
(b)  a hypothetical currency. 
 
8.4.49 
A Reporting Bank must convert its foreign currency derivatives and derivative 
positions in gold into notional positions in the relevant foreign currencies and in gold in 
accordance with Annex 8I.  
 
 
Sub-division 5: Commodity Risk 
 
8.4.50 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its market risk capital requirement for 
commodity risk by –  
 
(a)  identifying the positions (including any notional positions) which have 
commodity risk; 
 
(b)  expressing each commodity position in terms of the standard unit of 
measurement for that position803; 
 
 
802  
An example is marginal operations of a foreign branch or subsidiary. 
803  
For example, barrels, kilos or grams. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-166 
(c)  converting each position into the reporting currency of the Reporting Bank 
at the prevailing foreign exchange spot rates and the current spot price 
for the commodity;  
 
(d)  calculating the market risk capital requirement for each commodity 
position in accordance with the simplified approach in paragraph 8.4.59 or 
the maturity ladder approach in paragraphs 8.4.60 to 8.4.61; and 
 
(e)  summing the resulting individual market risk capital requirement for each 
commodity position. 
 
8.4.51 
A Reporting Bank must convert its commodity derivatives into notional positions 
in the relevant commodities in accordance with Annex 8J.  
 
 
Scope 
 
8.4.52 
In calculating its market risk capital requirement for commodity risk, a 
Reporting Bank must include all positions804 within the scope of application set out in Sub-
division 2 of Division 1 of this Part, whether such positions are long or short, in instruments 
(including derivatives805 and off-balance sheet instruments), whose market values are 
affected by changes in commodity prices, regardless of whether these positions are in the 
trading book or banking book unless –  
 
(a)  it is a gold position, in which case the Reporting Bank must include the 
position within the scope of its foreign exchange risk and calculate it in 
accordance with Sub-division 4 of this Division;  
 
(b) 
the position is an option or a position hedging an option, which is caught 
under Sub-division 6 of this Division, except where the Reporting Bank is 
required under that Sub-division to include the delta-weighted position in 
this Sub-division; or  
 
(c) 
the position arises purely from stock financing, which is a transaction 
where a physical commodity is sold forward and the cost of funding is 
locked in until the date of the forward sale. 
 
8.4.53 
For the purposes of this Sub-division, “commodity” includes a physical product 
which is or can be traded on a secondary market806. 
 
8.4.54 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must treat any interest rate risk or foreign 
exchange risk, arising from stock financing in accordance with Sub-divisions 2 and 4 of 
this Division, respectively.  
 
 
 
 
 
804 
This includes positions in any commodity that is sold under a repo or lent under a commodities lending 
transaction, but excludes positions in any commodity that is bought under a reverse repo or borrowed 
under a commodities borrowing transaction. 
805 
For example, commodity futures or commodity swaps. 
806  
Examples are agricultural products, minerals (including oil) and precious metals. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-167 
Allowable Offsetting of Matched Positions 
 
8.4.55 
For the purposes of calculating the market risk capital requirement for its 
commodity positions, a Reporting Bank may offset the long and short positions in an 
identical commodity. 
 
8.4.56 
A Reporting Bank must treat positions in different sub-categories of the same 
commodity as different commodities unless they –  
 
(a)  can be delivered against each other; or 
 
(b)  are close substitutes of each other and have price movements which have 
exhibited a stable correlation coefficient of at least 0.9 over the last 12 
months.  
 
8.4.57 
A Reporting Bank that relies on the approach in paragraph 8.4.56(b) must 
monitor the correlation coefficient of the price movements of the commodities to ensure 
that it is at least 0.9 on a continuing basis. The Reporting Bank must cease to treat 
positions in different sub-categories of the same commodity as the same commodity 
pursuant to paragraph 8.4.56(b) if the correlation coefficient of the price movements of 
the commodities ceases to be at least 0.9 at any time. 
 
8.4.58 
A Reporting Bank which intends to rely on the approach in paragraph 8.4.56(b) 
must obtain the prior approval of the Authority. The Authority will generally grant its 
approval if it is satisfied that the chosen method is accurate. 
 
 
Simplified Approach 
 
8.4.59 
A Reporting Bank using the simplified approach must calculate the market risk 
capital requirement for each commodity by summing –  
 
(a)  15% of the net position in the commodity, including the net delta-
weighted position of options on that commodity where the Reporting Bank 
is using the delta-plus method to calculate its market risk capital 
requirement for options; and 
 
(b)  3% of the gross position (long plus short, ignoring the sign) in the 
commodity, including the gross delta-weighted position of options on that 
commodity where the Reporting Bank is using the delta-plus method to 
calculate its market risk capital requirement for options. 
 
 
Maturity Ladder Approach807 
 
8.4.60 
A Reporting Bank using the maturity ladder approach must calculate the market 
risk capital requirement for each commodity by –  
 
 
807 
An illustration on the calculation of the market risk capital requirement for commodity risk under the 
maturity ladder approach is set out in Annex 8K. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-168 
(a)  offsetting long and short positions, including the net delta-weighted 
position of options on that commodity where the Reporting Bank is using 
the delta-plus method to calculate its market risk capital requirement for 
options, maturing –  
 
(i)  
on the same day; or 
 
(ii)  in the case of positions arising from contracts traded in markets with 
daily delivery dates, within 10 business days of each other; 
 
(b)  allocating the remaining positions to the appropriate maturity time-bands 
as follows:  
 
(i)  
up to 1 month; 
 
(ii)  more than 1 month but not more than 3 months; 
 
(iii)  more than 3 months but not more than 6 months; 
 
(iv)  more than 6 months but not more than 12 months; 
 
(v)  more than 1 year but not more than 2 years; 
 
(vi)  more than 2 years but not more than 3 years;  
 
(vii)  more than 3 years; 
 
(c)  matching long and short positions within each time-band, and for each 
time-band, calculating a spread charge equal to the sum of long and short 
positions matched multiplied by the spread rate of 1.5%; 
 
(d)  carrying unmatched positions remaining from a shorter maturity time-
band to a longer maturity time-band where they can be matched, then 
matching them until all matching possibilities are exhausted. In each 
instance, calculating – 
 
(i)  
a carry charge equal to the carried position multiplied by the carry 
rate of 0.6% and the number of time-bands by which the position is 
carried; and 
 
(ii)  a spread charge equal to the sum of long and short positions 
matched multiplied by the spread rate of 1.5%; 
 
(e)  calculating the outright charge on the remaining positions (which will 
either be all long positions or all short positions) equal to the sum of the 
remaining positions (ignoring the sign) multiplied by the outright charge 
of 15%; and 
 
(f)  summing the spread rates, carry rates and outright charge determined in 
sub-paragraphs (c) to (e). 
 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-169 
8.4.61 
A Reporting Bank must allocate physical commodity positions to the time-band 
of up to 1 month. 
 
 
Sub-division 6: Treatment of Options  
 
8.4.62 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its market risk capital requirement for options 
using –  
 
(a) 
the simplified approach in accordance with paragraphs 8.4.64 to 8.4.68; 
 
(b) 
the delta-plus method in accordance with paragraphs 8.4.69 to 8.4.77; or  
 
(c) 
the scenario approach in accordance with paragraphs 8.4.78 to 8.4.85. 
 
8.4.63 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.4.62, a Reporting Bank must use the more 
sophisticated methods under the SSA(MR) i.e. the delta-plus method or the scenario 
approach, if it engages in significant options trading. The Reporting Bank must also 
monitor closely other risks associated with options808. Despite the above, a Reporting Bank 
which trades in exotic options809 must use the scenario approach to calculate its market 
risk capital requirement for such options, unless it is able to demonstrate, to the 
satisfaction of the Authority, that the delta-plus method is appropriate.  
 
 
Simplified Approach810 
 
8.4.64  
A Reporting Bank may use the simplified approach only if –  
 
(a)  it does not write options; or 
 
(b)  where it writes options, all its written options are hedged by perfectly 
matched long positions in exactly the same options, in which case, the 
Reporting Bank need not calculate market risk capital requirements for 
these positions. 
 
8.4.65 
Under the simplified approach, a Reporting Bank must exclude the positions in 
the options and the positions hedging the options that are outright positions in the 
associated underlying instruments, from the requirements in Sub-divisions 2 to 5 of this 
Division, and must separately calculate the market risk capital requirements for those 
positions in accordance with paragraph 8.4.66. The Reporting Bank must add the market 
risk capital requirements for those positions to the market risk capital requirements for 
the interest rate, equity, foreign exchange and commodity risk categories, as the case 
may be, calculated in accordance with Sub-divisions 2 to 5 of this Division. 
 
 
808  
Examples of other risks associated with options are rho (this measures the rate of change of the option 
value with respect to interest rate) and theta (this measures the rate of change of the option value with 
respect to time). A Reporting Bank may also incorporate rho within their market risk capital requirement 
for interest rate risk. 
809  
Examples are barriers and digitals. 
810 
An illustration on the calculation of the market risk capital requirement under the simplified approach is set 
out in Annex 8L. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-170 
8.4.66 
A Reporting Bank using the simplified approach must calculate its market risk 
capital requirement for options by –  
 
(a)  identifying the options and the outright positions in associated underlying 
instruments; 
 
(b)  calculating the market risk capital requirement for each combination of a 
long put and a long outright position in the associated underlying 
instrument, or of a long call and a short outright position in the associated 
underlying instrument, by –  
 
(i)  
multiplying the market value of the outright position by the sum of 
the applicable specific and general risk charges, or single applicable 
risk charge, as the case may be; and  
 
(ii)  subtracting the amount the option is in the money (if any) bounded 
at zero; 
 
(c)  calculating the market risk capital requirement for each long call or long 
put as –  
 
(i)  
the market value of the underlying instrument multiplied by the sum 
of the applicable specific and general risk charges, or single 
applicable risk charge, as the case may be; or 
 
(ii)  the market value of the option, 
 
whichever is lower; and 
 
(d)  summing the market risk capital requirements determined in sub-
paragraphs (b) and (c). 
 
8.4.67 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.4.66(b) and (c) – 
 
(a)  a reference to the “underlying instrument” is a reference to the asset 
which would have been received if the option were to be exercised and 
physically settled; 
 
(b) where the market value of the underlying instrument of an option is zero811, 
the Reporting Bank must use the notional value of the option; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must812 – 
 
(i) 
determine the specific and general risk charges in respect of options 
on interest rate-related instruments in accordance with Sub-division 
2 of this Division; 
 
 
811  
For example, if the option is a cap, floor or swaption. 
812  
To avoid doubt, options on zero-specific risk securities bear no specific risk. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-171 
(ii) 
determine the specific and general risk charges in respect of options 
on equities and options on equity indices in accordance with Sub-
division 3 of this Division; 
 
(iii) apply a risk charge of 8% in respect of foreign currency options and 
gold options; and 
 
(iv) apply a risk charge of 15% in respect of options on commodities; and 
 
(d) 
despite paragraph 8.4.66(c)(ii), where the position in the option does not 
fall within the trading book813, a Reporting Bank may use the book value 
of the option instead. 
 
8.4.68 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.4.66(b)(ii), a Reporting Bank must compare 
the strike price of an option that has a residual maturity of more than 6 months with the 
forward, and not current, price of the underlying, unless it is unable to do so, in which 
case it must take the in-the-money amount to be zero. 
 
 
Delta-plus method814 
 
8.4.69 
A Reporting Bank using the delta-plus method must calculate its market risk 
capital requirement for options by –  
 
(a)  calculating the delta-weighted position of each option in accordance with 
paragraph 8.4.70 and adding these delta-weighted positions to the net 
positions in the relevant risk category in Sub-divisions 2 to 5 of this 
Division for the purposes of calculating the specific risk and general market 
risk capital requirements; 
 
(b)  calculating the capital requirement for gamma 815  risk of its option 
positions (including hedge positions) based on the options pricing model 
of the Reporting Bank, in accordance with paragraphs 8.4.73 to 8.4.76;  
 
(c)  calculating the capital requirement for vega816 risk of its option positions 
(including hedge positions) based on the options pricing model of the 
Reporting Bank, in accordance with paragraph 8.4.77; and 
 
(d)  summing the capital requirements determined in sub-paragraphs (b) and 
(c). 
 
8.4.70 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its delta-weighted position for each option as 
follows:  
 
(a)  where the underlying is a financial instrument, FX or commodity – 
 
 
813  
For example, options on certain foreign exchange or commodities positions that do not belong to the trading 
book.  
814 
An illustration on the calculation of the market risk capital requirement under the delta-plus method is set 
out in Annex 8M. 
815  
This measures the rate of change of delta. 
816  
This measures the sensitivity of the value of the option with respect to a change in volatility.

8.4.71 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.4.70(a), in the case of options on a futures 
contract or forward on a financial instrument, FX or commodity, a Reporting Bank must 
treat the underlying financial instrument, FX or commodity on which the futures contract 
or forward is based, as the relevant underlying financial instrument, FX or commodity.817  
 
8.4.72 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.4.70(b), a Reporting Bank must determine the 
delta-weighted position for the interest rate option in accordance with Annex 8N.  
 
8.4.73 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the "gamma impact" for each individual option 
according to a Taylor series expansion as follows:  
 
 
Gamma impact = ½ x Gamma x (VU)²  
 
 
where VU = variation of the underlying financial instrument, FX or commodity 
of the option or, where the underlying is an interest rate, variation of the 
equivalent interest rate-related instrument determined in accordance with 
Annex 8N. 
 
8.4.74 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.4.73, a Reporting Bank must calculate VU as 
follows: 
 
(a)  for any interest rate-related option, the market value of the underlying 
interest rate-related instruments (including a derived notional position in 
an equivalent interest rate-related instrument) multiplied by the relevant 
general risk charge in accordance with Table 8E-2;  
 
(b)  for any option on equities and any option on equity indices, the market 
value of the underlying equities or equity indices multiplied by 8%;  
 
(c)  for any foreign currency option or gold option, the market value of the 
underlying currency or gold instruments multiplied by 8%; and 
 
(d)  for any option on commodities, the market value of the underlying 
commodities multiplied by 15%. 
 
817  
For example, for a bought call option on a June 3-month bill futures contract, the relevant underlying 
instrument is the 3-month bill. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-173 
 
8.4.75 
A Reporting Bank must treat all of the following positions as positions with the 
same underlying for the purposes of calculating the gamma impact: 
 
(a)  for interest rate-related instruments denominated in the same currency, 
positions (including a derived notional position in an equivalent interest 
rate-related instrument where the underlying is an interest rate) under 
each time-band as set out in Table 8E-2 or Table 8E-3, depending on 
whether the Reporting Bank is using the maturity method or the duration 
method; 
 
(b)  for equities and equity indices, positions in the same country or jurisdiction 
portfolio; 
 
(c)  for foreign currencies, positions in the same currency pair;  
 
(d) 
for gold, positions in gold;  
 
(e)  for commodities, positions in the same individual commodity, or positions 
treated as the same commodity pursuant to paragraphs 8.4.55 and 8.4.56. 
 
8.4.76 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its capital requirement for gamma risk by –  
 
(a)  calculating the net gamma impact, which may be positive or negative, in 
respect of each underlying financial instrument, FX or commodity, where 
positions are treated as positions with the same underlying in accordance 
with paragraph 8.4.75, by aggregating the individual gamma impacts for 
each option position, which may be either positive or negative, in respect 
of that underlying financial instrument, FX or commodity; and 
 
(b)  aggregating the absolute value of the net gamma impacts that are 
negative. 
 
8.4.77 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its capital requirement for vega risk by –  
 
(a)  multiplying the sum of the vegas for all option positions in respect of the 
same underlying financial instrument, FX or commodity, where positions 
are treated as positions with the same underlying in accordance with 
paragraph 8.4.75, by a proportional shift in volatility of ±25%; and 
 
(b)  aggregating the absolute value of the individual capital requirements 
which have been calculated for vega risk. 
 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-174 
 
Scenario Approach818 
 
8.4.78 
A Reporting Bank must obtain the prior approval of the Authority before using 
the scenario approach to calculate its market risk capital requirement for options.819 
 
8.4.79 
Under the scenario approach, a Reporting Bank must exclude the positions in 
the options and the positions hedging the options, from the requirements in Sub-divisions 
2 to 5 of this Division for the purposes of calculating its general market risk capital 
requirements, and must calculate the market risk capital requirements for those positions 
in accordance with paragraph 8.4.82.  
 
8.4.80 
A Reporting Bank applying the scenario approach must analyse its option 
portfolios using a two-dimensional matrix820 where – 
 
(a)  the first dimension analyses the changes in the value of the option 
portfolio due to changes in the value of the underlying within a specified 
range of the current value; and  
 
(b)  the second dimension analyses the changes in value of the option portfolio 
due to changes in the volatility of the value of the underlying within that 
range,  
 
and the Reporting Bank must set up a separate matrix for each group of positions that are 
treated as positions with the same underlying in accordance with paragraph 8.4.75. 
 
8.4.81 
For the purposes of paragraphs 8.4.80, 8.4.82, 8.4.84 and Annex 8O, “option 
portfolio” means each group of positions that are treated as positions with the same 
underlying in accordance with paragraph 8.4.75, and for which a separate matrix has been 
set up. 
 
8.4.82 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its market risk capital requirement for the 
positions referred to in paragraph 8.4.79 under the scenario approach by –  
 
(a) 
calculating the delta-weighted position of each position in accordance with 
paragraph 8.4.70 and adding these delta-weighted positions to the 
relevant risk category in Sub-divisions 2 to 5 of this Division for the 
purposes of calculating the specific risk capital requirement; 
 
(b) 
calculating the general market risk capital requirement by –  
 
(i)  
specifying, for each option portfolio, a fixed range of changes in the 
rate or price of the underlying in accordance with paragraph 8.4.83. 
For all risk categories, the Reporting Bank must use at least 7 
observations, including the current observation, to divide the range 
into equally spaced intervals; 
 
 
818  
The scenario approach uses simulation techniques to calculate changes in the value of an option portfolio 
for changes in the level and volatility of the prices of its associated underlying. 
819  
The Reporting Bank should, among others, take into account standards listed in Division 3 of this Part on 
IMA, which are relevant given the nature of the business. 
820  
An example is set out in Annex 8O. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-175 
(ii)  specifying, for each option portfolio, a shift in the volatility of the 
rate or price of ±25%;  
 
(iii)  revaluing each option portfolio for simultaneous changes in the rate 
or price of the underlying and in the volatility of that rate or price; 
and 
 
(iv)  aggregating the absolute value of the largest loss computed in each 
option portfolio matrix; and 
 
(c)  summing the capital requirements determined in sub-paragraph (b)(iv). 
 
8.4.83 
A Reporting Bank must use the following specified range of changes in the rate 
or price of the underlying: 
 
(a)  for interest rates, the range must be ± the relevant assumed change in 
yield in Table 8E-2; 
 
(b)  for equities, the range must be ±8%; 
 
(c) 
for foreign exchange and gold, the range must be ±8%; and  
 
(d)  for commodities, the range must be ±15%. 
 
8.4.84 
Subject to the approval of the Authority, a Reporting Bank which has significant 
positions in interest rate options may analyse the changes in its interest rate option 
portfolio using a minimum of 6 sets of time-bands. A Reporting Bank using this approach 
must not combine more than 3 of the time-bands as defined in Table 8E-2 into any one 
set. For each set of time-bands, the Reporting Bank must apply the highest of the assumed 
changes in yield in Table 8E-2 applicable to the group to which the time-bands belong.821 
 
8.4.85 
Despite the parameters prescribed in paragraph 8.4.82(b)(i) and (ii), the 
Authority may require a Reporting Bank to use a different change in rate, price, or volatility, 
or to calculate intermediate points on the matrix. 
 
 
821 
For example, if the time-bands of 3 to 4 years, 4 to 5 years and 5 to 7 years are combined, the highest 
assumed change in yield of these 3 time-bands would be 0.75.

Division 5: Regulatory CVA 
 
 
Sub-division 1: Overview of Calculation of CVA RWA 
 
8.5.1  
Subject to paragraph 8.5.10, a Reporting Bank must calculate its CVA RWA as 
12.5 times the sum of – 
 
(a)  the CVA risk capital requirement calculated using the BA-CVA in 
accordance with paragraph 8.5.12; and 
 
(b)  the CVA risk capital requirement calculated using the SA-CVA in 
accordance with paragraph 8.5.29. 
 
8.5.2 
For the purposes of calculation of CVA RWA –  
 
(a)  “covered transactions” comprise –  
 
(i) 
all 
OTC 
derivative 
transactions, 
exchange-traded 
derivative 
transactions and long settlement transactions, except where such 
transactions are –  
 
(A) transacted directly with a qualifying CCP; or 
 
(B) transacted indirectly with a qualifying CCP where – 
 
(I) 
the Reporting Bank is a client of a clearing member or a 
lower level client in a multi-level client structure; and  
 
(II) the Reporting Bank meets the conditions to apply the 
treatment in paragraph 7.7.20 or 7.7.23 in respect of such 
transactions; and 
 
(ii) 
if the Reporting Bank’s CVA losses arising from SFTs are material, 
SFTs that are fair-valued by the Reporting Bank for accounting 
purposes, including SFTs for which the Reporting Bank records zero 
for CVA reserves for accounting purposes; and  
 
(b) 
the CVA portfolio comprises CVA for the Reporting Bank’s entire portfolio 
of covered transactions as set out in sub-paragraph (a) and eligible CVA 
hedges. 
 
8.5.3 
A Reporting Bank must calculate CVA risk capital requirements for covered 
transactions in the banking book and covered transactions in the trading book.  
 
8.5.4 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.5.2(a)(ii), if a Reporting Bank deems the CVA 
losses arising from SFTs that are fair-valued by the Reporting Bank for accounting 
purposes to be immaterial, the Reporting Bank must justify its assessment to the Authority 
by providing relevant supporting documentation in Schedule 3-4A, and may exclude such 
SFTs from “covered transactions” unless otherwise specified by the Authority. 
 
8.5.5 
A Reporting Bank must treat an external CVA hedge as follows: 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-177 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must include all external CVA hedges, whether or not 
such external CVA hedges meet the eligibility criteria specified in 
paragraph 8.5.15 for the BA-CVA or paragraph 8.5.28 for the SA-CVA, 
whichever is applicable, that are covered transactions in the CVA risk 
capital calculation of the counterparty providing the CVA hedge; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must exclude all external CVA hedges that meet the 
eligibility criteria specified in paragraph 8.5.15 for the BA-CVA or 
paragraph 8.5.28 for the SA-CVA, whichever is applicable, from the 
Reporting Bank’s market risk capital requirement calculations under 
Divisions 2, 3 and 4 of this Part; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must treat all external CVA hedges that do not meet 
the eligibility criteria specified in paragraph 8.5.15 for the BA-CVA or 
paragraph 8.5.28 for the SA-CVA, whichever is applicable, as trading book 
instruments and capitalise them under Divisions 2, 3 or 4 of this Part. 
 
8.5.6 
A Reporting Bank must treat an internal CVA hedge822 as follows: 
 
(a) 
if the Reporting Bank has documented the internal risk transfer with 
respect to the CVA risk being hedged and all the sources of such CVA risk, 
and the internal CVA hedge meets the eligibility criteria specified in 
paragraph 8.5.15 for the BA-CVA or paragraph 8.5.28 for the SA-CVA, 
whichever is applicable, the Reporting Bank must –  
 
(i) 
recognise the position of the internal CVA hedge for the CVA portfolio 
in its CVA risk capital requirement under this Division; 
 
(ii) 
recognise the opposite position of the internal CVA hedge for the 
market risk portfolio under the trading book, in its market risk capital 
requirement under Divisions 2, 3 or 4 of this Part; and 
 
(iii) not recognise the position of the internal CVA hedge for the CVA 
portfolio in its market risk capital requirement under Divisions 2, 3 
and 4 of this Part; 
 
(b) 
in all other cases, the Reporting Bank must not recognise the internal CVA 
hedge in its CVA risk capital requirement under this Division, and in its 
market risk capital requirement under Divisions 2, 3 or 4 of this Part823. 
 
8.5.7 
A Reporting Bank must use the BA-CVA for the calculation of its CVA risk capital 
requirements, unless the Reporting Bank has received prior approval of the Authority to 
use the SA-CVA for the calculation of its CVA risk capital requirements in accordance with 
paragraph 8.5.19. 
 
822  
An internal CVA hedge involves two perfectly offsetting positions, one for the CVA portfolio, and one for the 
market risk portfolio under the trading book. 
823  
For example, if the internal CVA hedge does not meet the eligibility criteria specified in paragraph 8.5.15 
for the BA-CVA or paragraph 8.5.28 for the SA-CVA, whichever is applicable, the positions of the internal 
CVA hedge for the CVA portfolio, and the market risk portfolio under the trading book, belong to the trading 
book where they cancel each other, resulting in no impact on both the CVA portfolio and the market risk 
portfolio under the trading book.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore

8.5.8 
A Reporting Bank that has received prior approval of the Authority to use the 
SA-CVA for the calculation of its CVA risk capital requirements may exclude any netting 
set from the calculation of its CVA risk capital requirements using the SA-CVA, provided 
that the Reporting Bank has informed the Authority, no more than 30 days after the netting 
set was first excluded from the calculation of its CVA risk capital requirements using the 
SA-CVA, of the scope of transactions in the netting set excluded and the rationale for such 
exclusion. The Reporting Bank must calculate CVA risk capital requirements for such 
netting sets using the BA-CVA.  
 
8.5.9 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.5.8, when excluding netting sets from the 
calculation of its CVA risk capital requirements using the SA-CVA, a Reporting Bank may 
split a netting set into two synthetic netting sets as follows: 
 
(a) 
a synthetic netting set that is subject to the BA-CVA and that contains the 
transactions which are excluded from the calculation of the Reporting 
Bank’s CVA risk capital requirements using the SA-CVA; 
 
(b) 
a synthetic netting set that is subject to the SA-CVA and that contains 
transactions which are subject to the calculation of the Reporting Bank’s 
CVA risk capital requirements using the SA-CVA; 
 
only if – 
 
(i) 
the splitting of the netting set is consistent with the treatment of the 
netting set used by the Reporting Bank for calculating CVA used for 
accounting purposes; or 
 
(ii) 
the approval of the Authority for the Reporting Bank to use the SA-CVA 
pursuant to paragraph 8.5.19 is limited and does not cover all transactions 
within a netting set.  
 
8.5.10 
If a Reporting Bank’s aggregate notional amount of non-centrally cleared 
derivatives is less than or equal to S$150 billion, the Reporting Bank may choose to set 
its CVA RWA equal to the sum of its CCR-SA RWA and CCR-IRBA RWA for its entire CVA 
portfolio, instead of calculating its CVA RWA in accordance with paragraph 8.5.1. A 
Reporting Bank that calculates CVA RWA in accordance with this paragraph must not 
recognise CVA hedges. 
 
8.5.11 
Despite paragraph 8.5.10, the Authority may require a Reporting Bank to not 
apply the treatment described in paragraph 8.5.10 and to calculate its CVA RWA in 
accordance with paragraph 8.5.1.824  
 
 
Sub-division 2: BA-CVA 
 
8.5.12 
A Reporting Bank using the BA-CVA must calculate its CVA risk capital 
requirement under the BA-CVA using either –  
 
 
824  
For example, the Authority may do so if it determines that CVA risk resulting from a Reporting Bank’s 
derivative positions materially contributes to the Reporting Bank’s overall risk.

(a) 
the full version of the BA-CVA (“full BA-CVA”), which recognises 
counterparty credit spread hedges, in accordance with paragraph 8.5.16; 
or 
 
(b) 
the reduced version of the BA-CVA (“reduced BA-CVA”), which does not 
recognise hedges, in accordance with paragraph 8.5.13. 
 
 
Reduced BA-CVA 
 
8.5.13 
A Reporting Bank using the reduced BA-CVA must calculate its CVA risk capital 
requirement as follows: 
 
𝐷𝑆𝐵𝐴−𝐶𝑉𝐴× 𝐾𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 
 
where 𝐷𝑆𝐵𝐴−𝐶𝑉𝐴 is the discount scalar and is equal to 0.65, and 𝐾𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 is calculated in 
accordance with paragraph 8.5.14. 
 
8.5.14 
A Reporting Bank using the BA-CVA must calculate 𝐾𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 as follows825: 
 
𝐾𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑= √(𝜌∙∑𝑆𝐶𝑉𝐴𝑐
𝑐
)
2
+ (1 −𝜌2) ∙∑𝑆𝐶𝑉𝐴𝑐2
𝑐
 
 
where –  
 
(a) 
summations are across all counterparties c of the Reporting Bank that are 
within the scope of the CVA risk capital requirement; 
 
(b) 𝑆𝐶𝑉𝐴𝑐 is the CVA risk capital requirement for counterparty 𝑐, and is 
calculated by the following formula –  
 
𝑆𝐶𝑉𝐴𝑐= 1
𝛼∙𝑅𝑊𝑐∙∑(𝑀𝑁𝑆∙𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑁𝑆∙𝐷𝐹𝑁𝑆)
𝑁𝑆
 
 
where –  
 
(i)  𝑅𝑊𝑐 is the risk weight for counterparty 𝑐 that reflects the volatility of 
its credit spread, as set out in Table 8-26, where –  
 
(A) if counterparty 𝑐 has one or more external credit assessments 
by recognised ECAIs, the Reporting Bank must assign a risk 
weight corresponding to the sector to which counterparty 𝑐 
belongs, and the credit quality of counterparty 𝑐, where the 
credit quality is determined by applying paragraph 7.3.30 and 
is based on the external credit assessments of counterparty c 
by recognised ECAIs; and 
 
825  
The first term, (𝜌∙∑𝑆𝐶𝑉𝐴𝐶
𝐶
)2, aggregates the systematic components of CVA risk, and the second term, 
(1 −𝜌2) ∙∑𝑆𝐶𝑉𝐴𝐶
2
𝐶
, aggregates the idiosyncratic components of CVA risk.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-180 
 
(B) if counterparty 𝑐 does not have an external credit assessment 
by a recognised ECAI –  
 
(I) 
in the case where the Reporting Bank has obtained 
approval from the Authority to adopt the IRBA pursuant 
to Division 4 of Part VII, the Reporting Bank may, with the 
prior written approval of the Authority, internally rate 
counterparty 𝑐, map the internal rating under the IRBA to 
a credit quality grade set out in Table 7M-1, and assign a 
risk weight corresponding to the sector to which 
counterparty 𝑐 belongs, and the credit quality associated 
with counterparty 𝑐; and 
 
(II) in all other cases, the Reporting Bank must assign a risk 
weight corresponding to the sector to which counterparty 
𝑐 belongs and a credit quality of “not rated”;  
 
(ii) 
𝑀𝑁𝑆 is the effective maturity for the netting set 𝑁𝑆, which is 
calculated as follows:  
 
(A)  for a Reporting Bank using the CCR internal models method, 
the Reporting Bank must calculate 𝑀𝑁𝑆 in accordance with the 
formula for M in paragraphs 5.1 to 5.3 of Annex 7E, except that 
the five year cap on M does not apply;  
 
(B) for a Reporting Bank not using the CCR internal models 
method, the Reporting Bank must calculate 𝑀𝑁𝑆 in accordance 
with the formula for M in Sections 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Annex 7V, 
except that the five year cap on M does not apply; 
 
(iii) 𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑁𝑆 is the E or EAD, whichever is applicable, of the netting set 𝑁𝑆, 
and is calculated in the same way as the Reporting Bank calculates 
its CCR exposures under Division 2 of Part VII; 
 
(iv) 𝐷𝐹𝑁𝑆 is the discount factor, and is calculated as follows826: 
 
(A) for a Reporting Bank using the CCR internal models method,  
 
𝐷𝐹𝑁𝑆= 1 
 
(B)  for a Reporting Bank not using the CCR internal models method, 
 
826  
𝐷𝐹 is the discount factor averaged over time between the current reporting date and the netting set’s 
effective maturity date. The interest rate used for discounting is set at 5%, hence 5% in the formula. The 
product of EAD and effective maturity in the BA-CVA formula is a proxy for the area under the discounted 
expected exposure profile of the netting set. The definition of effective maturity under the CCR internal 
models method already includes this discount factor, hence DF is set to 1 for a Reporting Bank using the 
CCR internal models method. Where the CCR internal models method is not used, the netting set’s effective 
maturity is defined as an average of actual trade maturities, and since this definition lacks discounting, the 
discount factor is added to compensate for this.

𝛼 is the multiplier used to convert effective EPE to EAD in both the SA-CCR and CCR internal models 
method. Its role in the calculation, therefore, is to convert the EAD of the netting set (𝐸𝐴𝐷𝑁𝑆) back to 
effective EPE.  
828  
The effect of 𝜌 is to recognise the fact that the CVA risk to which a Reporting Bank is exposed is less than 
the sum of the CVA risk for each counterparty, given that the credit spreads of counterparties are typically 
not perfectly correlated.  
829  
One of the basic assumptions underlying the BA-CVA is that systematic credit spread risk is driven by a 
single factor. Under this assumption, 𝜌 can be interpreted as the correlation between the credit spread of 
a counterparty and the single credit spread systematic factor.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-182 
Full BA-CVA 
 
8.5.15 
A Reporting Bank using the full BA-CVA must recognise the effect of 
counterparty credit spread hedges which meet all of the following conditions: 
 
(a) 
the hedge is a transaction used for the purposes of mitigating the 
counterparty credit spread component of CVA risk, and is managed as 
such; 
 
(b) 
the hedge is in the form of a single-name credit default swap, a single-
name contingent credit default swap or an index credit default swap; 
 
(c) 
for hedges in the form of a single-name credit default swap or a single-
name contingent credit default swap, the hedge must reference one of the 
following entities: 
 
(i) 
the counterparty;  
 
(ii) 
an entity that is either the parent company or subsidiary of the 
counterparty, or an entity that has the same parent company as the 
counterparty; 
 
(iii)  an entity that belongs to the same sector as set out in Table 8-26, 
and country or jurisdiction, as the counterparty; 
 
(d) 
if the hedge is an internal CVA hedge that involves an instrument that is 
subject to curvature risk, default risk charge or the residual risk add-on, 
under the SA(MR) under Division 2 of this Part, the Reporting Bank must 
have entered, through its trading book, into an external hedge with an 
eligible protection provider that exactly offsets the position of the internal 
CVA hedge for the market risk portfolio under the trading book with the 
CVA portfolio. 
 
8.5.16 
A Reporting Bank using the full BA-CVA must calculate its CVA risk capital 
requirement as follows: 
 
𝐷𝑆𝐵𝐴−𝐶𝑉𝐴× 𝐾𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 
 
where 𝐷𝑆𝐵𝐴−𝐶𝑉𝐴 is the discount scalar and is equal to 0.65, and 𝐾𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 is calculated in 
accordance with paragraph 8.5.17.  
 
8.5.17 
A Reporting Bank using the full BA-CVA must calculate 𝐾𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 as follows:  
 
𝐾𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙= 𝛽∙𝐾𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑+ (1 −𝛽) ∙𝐾ℎ𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑 
 
where –  
 
(a) 𝛽= 0.25 and is the supervisory parameter that is used to limit the extent 
to which hedging can reduce the CVA risk capital requirements; 
 
(b) 𝐾𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 is calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.5.14; and 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-183

that are within scope of the CVA risk capital requirement; 
 
(ii) 
𝑆𝐶𝑉𝐴𝑐 is calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.5.14(b); 
 
(iii) 𝜌 is calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.5.14(c); 
 
(iv) 𝑆𝑁𝐻𝑐831 is calculated as follows: 
 
𝑆𝑁𝐻𝐶= ∑(𝑟ℎ𝑐∙𝑅𝑊ℎ∙𝑀ℎ
𝑆𝑁∙𝐵ℎ
𝑆𝑁∙𝐷𝐹ℎ
𝑆𝑁)
ℎ∈𝑐
 
 
where – 
 
(A) the summation is across all eligible CVA hedges which are 
single-name hedges h that the Reporting Bank has entered into 
to hedge the CVA risk of counterparty c; 
 
(B) 𝑟ℎ𝑐 is the correlation between the credit spread of the 
counterparty c and the credit spread of an eligible CVA hedge 
which is a single-name hedge h of counterparty c. The value of 
𝑟ℎ𝑐 is given in Table 8-27; 
 
(C) 𝑅𝑊ℎ is the risk weight of the eligible CVA hedge which is a 
single-name hedge h that reflects the volatility of the credit 
spread of the reference name of the hedging instrument. The 
risk weight is based on the sector and credit quality of the 
reference name of the hedging instrument and is given in Table 
8-26; 
 
(D) 𝑀ℎ
𝑆𝑁 is the remaining maturity of the eligible CVA hedge which 
is a single-name hedge h; 
 
 
830  
The first term (𝜌∙∑(𝑆𝐶𝑉𝐴𝐶−𝑆𝑁𝐻𝐶) −𝐼𝐻
𝐶
)2 aggregates the systematic components of CVA risk arising 
from the Reporting Bank’s counterparties, and the eligible CVA hedges which are single-name hedges or 
index hedges. The second term (1 −𝜌2) ∙∑(𝑆𝐶𝑉𝐴𝐶−𝑆𝑁𝐻𝐶)2
𝐶
 aggregates the idiosyncratic components of 
CVA risk arising from the Reporting Bank’s counterparties and the eligible CVA hedges which are single-
name hedges. The third term ∑𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶
𝐶
 aggregates the components of eligible CVA hedges which are 
indirect hedges (i.e. not aligned with counterparties’ credit spreads).  
831  
𝑆𝑁𝐻𝑐 is a quantity that gives recognition to the reduction in CVA risk of the counterparty c arising from the 
Reporting Bank’s use of eligible CVA hedges which are single-name hedges of credit spread risk.

where – 
 
(A) the summation is across all eligible CVA hedges which are index 
hedges i that the Reporting Bank has entered into to hedge CVA 
risk; 
 
(B) 𝑅𝑊𝑖 is the risk weight of the eligible CVA hedge which is an 
index hedge i. The risk weight is based on the sector and credit 
quality of the index constituents and is given in Table 8-26, 
adjusted as follows: 
 
(1) for an index where all index constituents belong to the 
same sector in Table 8-26 and have the same credit 
quality, the Reporting Bank must multiply the relevant 
value in Table 8-26 by 0.7833; 
 
(2) for an index with constituents that belong to different 
sectors in Table 8-26 or that do not have the same credit 
quality, the Reporting Bank must calculate the weighted 
average of the risk weights from Table 8-26, based on the 
weightings of the index constituents, and multiply it by 
0.7; 
 
(C) 𝑀𝑖
𝑖𝑛𝑑 is the remaining maturity of the eligible CVA hedge which 
is an index hedge i; 
 
(D) 𝐵𝑖
𝑖𝑛𝑑 is the notional of the eligible CVA hedge which is an index 
hedge i; and 
 
832  
𝐼𝐻 is a quantity that gives recognition to the reduction in CVA risk across all counterparties arising from 
the Reporting Bank’s use of eligible CVA hedges which are index hedges.

For the purposes of paragraph 8.5.17, a Reporting Bank must treat the credit 
quality of two index constituents to be the same only in the following cases: 
 
(a)  if both index constituents have credit quality grades of “3” or better as set 
out in Table 7M-1; 
 
(b)  if both index constituents have credit quality grades of “4” or worse as set 
out in Table 7M-1;

𝐻𝑀𝐴𝑐 is a quantity characterising hedging misalignment designed to limit the extent to which indirect 
hedges can reduce CVA risk capital requirements given that indirect hedges will not be able to fully offset 
movements in a counterparty’s credit spread. This means that with indirect hedges present, 𝐾ℎ𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑑 cannot 
reach zero.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore

Sub-division 3: SA-CVA 
 
8.5.19 
A Reporting Bank must obtain the Authority’s prior written approval to use the 
SA-CVA to calculate its CVA risk capital requirements. The Authority will not grant such 
approval unless the Reporting Bank meets all the requirements set out in paragraph 8.5.20.  
 
8.5.20 
A Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must meet all the following requirements, 
at the minimum, before applying for approval from the Authority to adopt the SA-CVA and 
on an ongoing basis after obtaining the Authority’s approval: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must be able to model exposure in accordance with 
paragraphs 8.5.21 to 8.5.27 and calculate, at least on a monthly basis, 
CVA and sensitivities to the risk factors specified in paragraphs 8.5.35 to 
8.5.73; 
 
(b) 
 the Reporting Bank must have – 
 
(i)  
a CVA desk, which is a group of traders in a business line within the 
Reporting Bank that is responsible for, or a group of trading accounts 
in a business line within the Reporting Bank that is used for, the risk 
management and hedging of CVA; or  
 
(ii)  a dedicated function responsible for risk management and hedging 
of CVA;  
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must have the ability to calculate its CVA risk capital 
requirements using the SA-CVA at any time and must provide such 
calculation to the Authority, upon request by the Authority. 
 
 
Calculation of Regulatory CVA  
 
8.5.21 
A Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must calculate the regulatory CVA for each 
counterparty with which it has at least one covered transaction, for the purpose of the CVA 
risk capital requirements, in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs 8.5.22 to 
8.5.27. 
 
8.5.22 
A Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must calculate the regulatory CVA for each 
counterparty in accordance with all of the following, and must demonstrate its compliance 
with this paragraph to the Authority at the Authority’s request: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must calculate the regulatory CVA for each 
counterparty as the expectation of future losses resulting from default of 
the counterparty under the assumption that the Reporting Bank itself is 
free from the default risk. In expressing the regulatory CVA, the Reporting 
Bank must ensure that losses have a positive sign;  
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank’s calculation of the regulatory CVA for each 
counterparty must be based on at least the following three sets of inputs: 
 
(i) 
term structure of market-implied probability of default; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-187 
(ii) 
market-consensus expected loss given default; 
 
(iii) simulated paths of discounted future exposure; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must estimate term structure of market-implied 
probability of default for each counterparty from credit spreads in the 
markets. For a counterparty whose credit is not actively traded (“illiquid 
counterparty”), the Reporting Bank must estimate market-implied 
probability of default from proxy credit spreads estimated for the 
counterparty in accordance with all of the following: 
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank must estimate the credit spread curve of an 
illiquid counterparty from credit spreads in the markets of the illiquid 
counterparty’s liquid peers via an algorithm that discriminates on at 
least credit quality835, industry and geographical region; 
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank may map an illiquid counterparty to a single 
liquid reference name 836 , where the Reporting Bank is able to 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority on the justification 
of such mapping; 
 
(iii) when no credit spreads of any of the illiquid counterparty’s peers are 
available837, the Reporting Bank may use a fundamental analysis of 
credit risk to proxy the spread of the illiquid counterparty, provided 
that where historical probabilities of default are used as part of this 
fundamental analysis of credit risk, the Reporting Bank must not 
base the spread of the illiquid counterparty that is proxied using the 
fundamental analysis of credit risk (“resulting proxied spread”) on 
only historical probabilities of default, and must ensure that the 
resulting proxied spread takes into consideration relevant data from 
credit markets; 
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the market-consensus expected loss 
given default value for a counterparty is the same as the one the Reporting 
Bank uses to calculate the risk-neutral probability of default from credit 
spreads for the counterparty, unless the Reporting Bank is able to 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that the seniority of the 
exposure resulting from the covered transactions with the counterparty 
differs from the seniority of senior unsecured bonds of the counterparty. 
In determining the seniority of the exposure, the Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the collateral provided by the counterparty does not result in 
a change in the seniority of the exposure; 
 
(e) 
the Reporting Bank must produce the simulated paths of discounted future 
exposure for a counterparty by pricing all covered transactions with the 
counterparty along simulated paths of relevant risk factors and 
discounting the prices to the current reporting date using risk-free interest 
rates along the path; 
 
835  
For example, credit ratings.

An example is mapping a municipality to the central government in which the municipality operates (i.e. 
setting the municipality credit spread equal to the credit spread of the central government plus a premium). 
837  
For example, where the illiquid counterparty is a project finance entity or a fund.

(f) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that all risk factors material for all the 
covered transactions with a counterparty are simulated as stochastic 
processes for an appropriate number of paths defined on an appropriate 
set of future time points extending to the maturity of the longest covered 
transaction; 
 
(g) 
for all covered transactions with a significant level of dependence between 
the exposure to the counterparty and the counterparty’s credit quality, the 
Reporting Bank must take this dependence into account in the 
computation of the regulatory CVA for the counterparty;  
 
(h) 
for a covered transaction with a counterparty where variation margin is 
exchanged, the Reporting Bank may recognise collateral as a risk mitigant

collateral management requirements set out in paragraphs 8.4 and 
8.5 of Annex 7E are satisfied; 
 
(ii) 
all documentation used in a covered transaction that is collateralised 
is binding on all parties and legally enforceable in all relevant 
jurisdictions within the meaning of paragraph 3.1(a) of Annex 7G. 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the documentation used in the 
covered transaction that is collateralised do not cease to be 
enforceable; 
 
(i) 
for a covered transaction with a counterparty where variation margin is 
exchanged –  
 
(i)  
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the simulated paths of 
discounted future exposure capture the effects of margining 
collateral that is recognised as a risk mitigant along each exposure 
path; 
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that all the relevant contractual 
features including the nature of the margin agreement 838 , the 
frequency of margin calls, the type of collateral, margin thresholds, 
independent collateral amounts, initial margins and minimum 
transfer amounts are appropriately captured by the exposure model; 
and 
 
(iii) to determine collateral available to the Reporting Bank at a given 
exposure measurement time point, the Reporting Bank must ensure 
that the exposure model assumes that –  
 
(A) the counterparty will not post or return any collateral within a 
certain time period immediately prior to that time point; and 
 
(B) the margin period of risk is not less than – 
 
 
838  
For example, unilateral or bilateral.

paragraph 7.7.35, 4 + N business days, where N is re-
margining period specified in the margin agreement839; 
and 
 
(II) for all other covered transactions, 9 + N business days, 
where N is the re-margining period specified in the margin 
agreement. 
 
8.5.23 
A Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must obtain the simulated paths of 
discounted future exposure set out in paragraph 8.5.22 via the exposure models used by 
the Reporting Bank for calculating CVA used by the front office or calculating CVA used for 
accounting purposes, adjusted to meet the requirements imposed for the calculation of its 
regulatory CVA in paragraph 8.5.22, and paragraphs 8.5.24 to 8.5.27.  
 
8.5.24 
A Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must ensure that the model calibration 
process (with the exception of the margin period of risk), market and transaction data

risk factors are not calibrated using historical data; 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must calibrate the volatilities and correlations of risk 
factors to market data whenever sufficient data exist in a given market. If 
there is insufficient data in a given market, the Reporting Bank may 
calibrate the volatilities and correlations of risk factors using historical data; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the distribution of modelled risk 
factors accounts for the possible non-normality of the distribution of 
exposures, including the existence of leptokurtosis where appropriate.  
 
8.5.26 
A Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must use the same netting recognition for 
the calculation of its regulatory CVA as that used by the Reporting Bank in its calculation 
of CVA for accounting purposes, for the purposes of determining netting sets under the 
SA-CVA. The Reporting Bank must model netting uncertainty.

accounting purposes; 
 
(e) 
the Reporting Bank must have a risk control unit that is responsible for 
the effective initial and ongoing validation of the exposure models, and 
this unit must be independent from the business and trading functions

adequately staffed and must report directly to senior management of the 
Reporting Bank; 
 
(f) 
the Reporting Bank must document –  
 
(i)

For example, sudden changes in market behaviour. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-191 
ensure that the pricing models for options account for the non-linearity of 
option value with respect to risk factors; 
 
(h) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that its IA carry out an independent

written policy, a description of the process for assessing the performance 
of exposure models and remedying performance that is deemed to be 
unacceptable following the assessment; 
 
(j) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the exposure models capture 
transaction-specific information in order to aggregate exposures at the 
level of the netting set. The Reporting Bank must verify that covered 
transactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the

exposure system correctly or conservatively; 
 
(l) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that the current and historical market 
data used for the calculation of regulatory CVA are – 
 
(i) 
acquired independently of the lines of business; 
 
(ii) 
compliant with the Accounting Standards; 
 
(iii) fed into the exposure models in a timely and complete manner; and 
 
(iv) maintained in a secure database subject to formal and periodic audit;  
 
 
841

(m) the Reporting Bank must have a well-developed process to ensure the 
integrity of, and handle erroneous or anomalous observations in, the 
current and historical data used for the calculation of regulatory CVA;  
 
(n) 
in the case where the Reporting Bank’s exposure model relies on proxy 
market data, the Reporting Bank must set internal policies to identify 
suitable proxies and verify empirically on an ongoing basis that the proxy 
provides a conservative representation of the underlying risk under 
adverse market conditions. 
 
 
Eligible CVA hedges under the SA-CVA 
 
8.5.28 
A Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must recognise the effect of hedges which 
meet all of the following conditions: 
 
(a) 
the hedge is an instrument that hedges the variability of the counterparty 
credit spread, the variability of the exposure component of CVA risk, or 
both; 
 
(b) 
the hedge is a transaction used for the purpose of mitigating CVA risk, and 
is managed as such; 
 
(c) 
the hedge is a whole transaction, and is not split into several effective 
transactions; 
 
(d) 
the hedge is not one of the following instruments for which the Reporting 
Bank is not allowed to use the IMA842: 
 
(i) 
securitisation exposures; 
 
(ii) 
equity investments in funds that cannot be looked through but are 
assigned to the trading book in accordance with the conditions set 
out in paragraph 8.1.27(e)(ii); 
 
(e) 
if the hedge is an internal CVA hedge that involves an instrument that is 
subject to curvature risk, default risk charge or the residual risk add-on, 
under the SA(MR) under Division 2 of this Part, the Reporting Bank must 
have entered through its trading book into an external hedge with an 
eligible protection provider that exactly offsets the position of the internal 
CVA hedge for the market risk portfolio under the trading book with the 
CVA portfolio. 
 
 
Calculation of CVA risk capital requirement under the SA-CVA 
 
8.5.29 
A Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must calculate its CVA risk capital 
requirement under the SA-CVA as the sum of the capital requirements for delta risk and 
vega risk for the CVA portfolio, where –  
 
 
842  
For example, tranched credit derivatives. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-193 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must calculate the capital requirements for delta risk 
as the sum of delta capital requirements calculated for each of the 
following six risk classes, in accordance with paragraphs 8.5.32 and 8.5.33: 
 
(i) 
interest rate risk; 
 
(ii)  foreign exchange risk; 
 
(iii) counterparty credit spread risk; 
 
(iv) reference credit spread risk; 
 
(v) 
equity risk; 
 
(vi) commodity risk; and 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must calculate the capital requirements for vega risk 
as the sum of vega capital requirements calculated for each of the 
following five risk classes, in accordance with paragraphs 8.5.32 and 
8.5.33: 
 
(i) 
interest rate risk; 
 
(ii)  foreign exchange risk; 
 
(iii) reference credit spread risk; 
 
(iv) equity risk; 
 
(v) 
commodity risk.  
 
8.5.30 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must not calculate vega 
capital requirements for counterparty credit spread risk. 
 
8.5.31 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.5.29, if an instrument is an eligible CVA hedge 
that hedges the variability for credit spread risk, a Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must 
assign it, in its entirety, either to the counterparty credit spread risk class or to the 
reference credit spread risk class, in accordance with paragraph 8.5.28(c).  
 
8.5.32 
Subject to paragraph 8.5.33, a Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must calculate 
the capital requirement for delta risk and the capital requirement for vega risk for each 
risk class using the steps as follows: 
 
(a) 
step 1: within each risk class, for each risk factor 𝑘 specified in paragraphs 
8.5.35 to 8.5.73, calculate – 
 
(i) 
the sensitivity of the aggregate regulatory CVA across all 
counterparties, where the regulatory CVA for each counterparty is 
calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.5.21, to each risk factor 
𝑘 in the risk class, 𝑠𝑘
𝐶𝑉𝐴; and 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-194 
(ii) 
the sensitivity of the market value of all eligible CVA hedges in the 
CVA portfolio to each risk factor 𝑘 in the risk class, 𝑠𝑘
𝐻𝑑𝑔, 
 
in accordance with paragraphs 8.5.35 to 8.5.73; 
 
(b) 
step 2: calculate the weighted sensitivities for each risk factor 𝑘, 𝑊𝑆𝑘
𝐶𝑉𝐴 
and 𝑊𝑆𝑘
𝐻𝑑𝑔, by multiplying the sensitivities 𝑠𝑘
𝐶𝑉𝐴 and 𝑠𝑘
𝐻𝑑𝑔, respectively, by 
the corresponding risk weight 𝑅𝑊𝑘 as defined in paragraphs 8.5.35 to 
8.5.73: 
 
𝑊𝑆𝑘
𝐶𝑉𝐴= 𝑅𝑊𝑘𝑠𝑘
𝐶𝑉𝐴 
 
𝑊𝑆𝑘
𝐻𝑑𝑔= 𝑅𝑊𝑘𝑠𝑘
𝐻𝑑𝑔 
 
(c) 
step 3: calculate the net weighted sensitivity of the CVA portfolio to risk 
factor 𝑘, 𝑊𝑆𝑘, by the following formula843: 
 
𝑊𝑆𝑘= 𝑊𝑆𝑘
𝐶𝑉𝐴−𝑊𝑆𝑘
𝐻𝑑𝑔 
 
(d) 
step 4 (aggregation within buckets): calculate the capital requirement 
within each bucket 𝑏, 𝐾𝑏, by the following formula: 
 
𝐾𝑏= √(∑𝑊𝑆𝑘
2
𝑘∈𝑏
+ ∑
∑
𝜌𝑘𝑙𝑊𝑆𝑘𝑊𝑆𝑙
𝑙∈𝑏,𝑙≠𝑘
𝑘∈𝑏
) + 𝑅∙∑((𝑊𝑆𝑘
𝐻𝑑𝑔)
2)
𝑘∈𝑏
 
 
where – 
 
(i) 
the buckets and correlation parameters 𝜌𝑘𝑙 applicable to each risk 
class are specified in paragraphs 8.5.35 to 8.5.73; 
 
(ii) 
𝑅= 0.01 and is the hedging disallowance parameter that prevents 
the possibility of recognising perfect hedging of CVA risk; and 
 
(iii) 𝑊𝑆𝑘 and 𝑊𝑆𝑙 are the net weighted sensitivities of the CVA portfolio 
to risk factors 𝑘 and 𝑙, respectively;  
 
(e) 
step 5 (aggregation across buckets): calculate the capital requirements, 
K for delta risk and K for vega risk for each risk class by aggregating the 
 
843  
Note that the formula in paragraph 8.5.32(c) is set out under the convention that the regulatory CVA is 
positive as specified in paragraph 8.5.22(a). It intends to recognise the risk reducing effect of hedging. For 
example, when hedging the counterparty credit risk spread component of CVA risk for a specific 
counterparty by buying credit protection on the counterparty: if the counterparty’s credit spread widens, 
the regulatory CVA (expressed as a positive value) increases resulting in the positive sensitivity to the 
counterparty credit spread. At the same time, as the value of the hedge from the Reporting Bank’s 
perspective increases as well (as protection becomes more valuable), the sensitivity of the hedge is also 
positive. The positive weighted sensitivities of the regulatory CVA and its hedge offset each other using the 
formula in paragraph 8.5.32(c), where there is a minus sign before the term 𝑊𝑆𝑘
𝐻𝑑𝑔. If CVA loss had been 
expressed as a negative value, the minus sign in the formula in paragraph 8.5.32(c) would have been 
replaced by a plus sign.  


Monetary Authority of Singapore

capital requirements for all buckets within each risk class using the 
following formula: 
 
𝐾= 𝑚𝐶𝑉𝐴∙√∑𝐾𝑏
2
𝑏
+ ∑∑𝛾𝑏𝑐𝑆𝑏𝑆𝑐
𝑏≠𝑐
𝑏
 
 
where – 
 
(i) 
𝑚𝐶𝑉𝐴= 1. The Authority may require a Reporting Bank to use a 
higher value of 𝑚𝐶𝑉𝐴 if the Authority determines that the Reporting 
Bank’s CVA model risk warrants it844; 
 
(ii) 
the cross-bucket correlation parameters 𝛾𝑏𝑐 applicable to each risk 
class are specified in paragraphs 8.5.35 to 8.5.73; and 
 
(iii) 𝑆𝑏 and 𝑆𝑐 are the sum of the net weighted sensitivities 𝑊𝑆𝑘 for all 
risk factors 𝑘 within buckets 𝑏 and 𝑐, respectively, floored by −𝐾𝑏 
and −𝐾𝑐, respectively, and capped by 𝐾𝑏 and 𝐾𝑐, respectively, and 
are given by the following formulae: 
 
𝑆𝑏= max {−𝐾𝑏; min (∑𝑊𝑆𝑘; 𝐾𝑏
𝑘∈𝑏
)} 
𝑆𝑐= max {−𝐾𝑐; min (∑𝑊𝑆𝑘; 𝐾𝑐
𝑘∈𝑐
)} 
 
8.5.33 
For the purposes of paragraph 8.5.32 –  
 
(a) 
when calculating sensitivities of its regulatory CVA to counterparty credit 
spreads and risk factors referred to in paragraph 8.5.32(a) driving the 
values of covered transactions under the SA-CVA, a Reporting Bank must 
calculate these sensitivities in accordance with the prudent valuation 
standards set out in Annex 6C; 
 
(b) 
a Reporting Bank may use smaller values of risk factor changes as 
compared to those set out in paragraphs 8.5.35 to 8.5.73 for calculating 
sensitivities, if doing so is consistent with the Reporting Bank’s internal 
risk management calculations; 
 
(c) 
a Reporting Bank may use adjoint algorithmic differentiation and similar 
algorithmic computational techniques to calculate sensitivities under the 
SA-CVA if doing so is consistent with the Reporting Bank’s internal risk 
management calculations and complies with the relevant validation 
standards specified in paragraph 8.5.27; 
 
 
844  
For example, if the level of model risk for the calculation of sensitivities is too high, or if the dependence 
between the Reporting Bank’s exposure to a counterparty and the counterparty’s credit quality is not 
appropriately taken into account in its CVA calculations. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-196 
(d) 
a Reporting Bank must calculate sensitivities for vega risk regardless of 
whether or not the CVA portfolio includes options. When calculating 
sensitivities for vega risks, the Reporting Bank must apply the volatility 
change to the following two types of volatilities in exposure models: 
 
(i) 
volatilities used for generating risk factor paths; 
 
(ii) 
volatilities used for pricing options; 
 
(e) 
for a covered transaction or an eligible CVA hedge, whose underlying is an 
index, a Reporting Bank must calculate the sensitivity of the covered 
transaction or the eligible CVA hedge, to all risk factors upon which the 
value of the index depends, by –  
 
(i) 
applying the change for each risk factor to all index constituents that 
depend on the risk factor; and  
 
(ii) 
recalculating the changed value of the index845; and 
 
(f) 
despite sub-paragraph (e), for the counterparty credit spread risk class, 
reference credit spread risk class and equity risk class, a Reporting Bank 
may choose to specify, for a covered transaction or an eligible CVA hedge, 
whose underlying is a qualified index, risk factors that directly correspond 
to a qualified index. If a Reporting Bank chooses this option, instead of 
calculating the sensitivities to all risk factors upon which the value of the 
index depends as specified in sub-paragraph (e), the Reporting Bank must 
calculate sensitivities for the covered transaction and the eligible CVA 
hedge to the risk factors that directly correspond to the qualified index846. 
 
8.5.34 
For the purposes of this Division, a qualified index means – 
 
(a)  for counterparty credit spread delta risk, reference credit spread delta risk 
and equity delta risk, a credit index or equity index, that is widely-
recognised, and that satisfies all of the following conditions:  
 
(i) 
the index is listed on an approved exchange or overseas exchange; 
 
(ii)  the Reporting Bank is able to look through the credit index or equity 
index, such that the constituents of the credit index or equity index 
and their respective weightings are known to the Reporting Bank; 
 
(iii)  the credit index or equity index contains at least 20 constituents; 
 
(iv)  no single constituent within the credit index or equity index has a 
weighting of more than 25% of the index; 
 
 
845  
For example, to calculate delta sensitivity of S&P500 to large financial companies, the Reporting Bank must 
apply the relevant change to equity prices of all large financial companies that are constituents of S&P500 
and recalculate the index.  
846  
For example, for a portfolio consisting only of equity derivatives referencing only qualified equity indices, 
no calculation of sensitivities to non-index equity risk factors is necessary. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-197 
(v)  the sum of the weightings of the largest 10% of the index 
constituents, based on the weightings of the index constituents, is 
less than 60% of the credit index or equity index;  
 
(vi)  the market capitalisation of all the constituents of the credit index or 
equity index is greater than or equal to USD 40 billion; and  
 
(b)  for reference credit spread vega risk and equity vega risk, any credit index 
or equity index. 
 
 
Buckets, risk factors, sensitivities, risk weights and correlations for interest rate 
risk  
 
8.5.35 
For interest rate delta and vega risks, a Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must 
treat each currency as a separate bucket.  
 
8.5.36 
For the reporting currency of a Reporting Bank and for the following currencies 
USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, SEK and JPY, a Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must – 
 
(a) 
specify the following interest rate delta risk factors for each currency:  
 
(i) 
a simultaneous change, by an absolute value, of the risk-free yields 
for all risk-free yield curves in each currency for each of the following 
five tenors: 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years and 30 years; 
 
(ii) 
the change, by an absolute value, of the inflation rate;  
 
(b) 
calculate the sensitivities as follows: 
 
(i)  
for each currency and each tenor point, calculate the sensitivity of 
the aggregate regulatory CVA to the risk-free yields for a tenor (𝑠𝑘
𝐶𝑉𝐴) 
by –  
 
(A) simultaneously changing, in an upwards direction, the risk-free 
yields for the tenor for all risk-free yield curves in each currency 
by 1 basis point; and  
 
(B) dividing the resulting change in the aggregate regulatory CVA 
by 0.0001; 
 
(ii)  for each currency and each tenor point, calculate the sensitivity of 
the market value of all eligible CVA hedges to the risk-free yields for 
a tenor (𝑠𝑘
𝐻𝑑𝑔) by – 
 
(A) simultaneously changing, in an upwards direction, the risk-free 
yields for the tenor for all risk-free yield curves in each currency 
by 1 basis point; and  
 
(B) dividing the resulting change in the market value of all eligible 
CVA hedges by 0.0001;

(iii) for each currency, calculate the sensitivity of aggregate regulatory 
CVA to the inflation rate (𝑠𝑘

point; and  
 
(B) dividing the resulting change in the aggregate regulatory CVA 
by 0.0001; 
 
(iv) for each currency, calculate the sensitivity of market value of all 
eligible CVA hedges to the inflation rate (𝑠𝑘
𝐻𝑑𝑔) by – 
 
(A) changing, in an upwards direction, the inflation rate by 1 basis 
point; and  
 
(B) dividing the result change in the market value of all eligible CVA 
hedges by 0.0001; 
 
(c) 
apply the risk weights (𝑅𝑊𝑘) in Table 8-28; and

For other currencies not specified in paragraph 8.5.36, a Reporting Bank using 
the SA-CVA must – 
 
(a) 
specify the following interest rate delta risk factors for each currency: 
 
(i) 
a simultaneous parallel shift of the entire risk-free yield curve for all 
risk-free yield curves in each currency;

8.5.62 
A Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must assign risk positions with equity delta 
or vega risks – 
 
(a) 
for a covered transaction referencing an individual equity, to a bucket set 
out in Table 8-36 that corresponds to the market capitalisation of the 
equity underlying the risk position, and the economy and sector to which 
the issuer of the equity underlying the risk position belongs; and 
 
(b)  for an eligible CVA hedge referencing an individual equity, to a bucket set 
out in Table 8-36 that corresponds to the market capitalisation of the 
equity underlying the risk position, and the economy and sector to which 
the issuer of the equity underlying the risk position belongs. 
 
8.5.63 
For a covered transaction, or an eligible CVA hedge, with equity delta or vega 
risks and which references either of the following indices, a Reporting Bank using the 
SA-CVA must look through the index to its index constituents:  
 
(a) 
a qualified index, if the Reporting Bank did not choose to calculate a single 
sensitivity to the underlying index in accordance with paragraph 8.5.33(f);  
 
(b) 
a non-qualified index. 
 
8.5.64 
A Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA must assign a risk position in each index 
constituent referred to in paragraph 8.5.63 to a bucket set out in Table 8-36 that 
corresponds to –  
 
(a)  the market capitalisation of the index constituent; and  
 
(b)  the economy and sector to which the issuer of the index constituent 
belongs. 
 
8.5.65 
For a covered transaction or an eligible CVA hedge, with equity delta or vega 
risks and which references a qualified index, where a Reporting Bank using the SA-CVA 
calculates sensitivities to the risk factors that directly correspond to a qualified index in 
accordance with paragraph 8.5.33(f), the Reporting Bank must –  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-217 
 
(a)  if more than 75% of constituents of the qualified index, based on the 
weightings of the constituents of the qualified index, are mapped to the 
same sector, assign the risk position in the qualified index, to the sector 
set out in Table 8-36 corresponding to buckets 1 to 11 of Table 8-36. In 
all other cases, the Reporting Bank must assign the risk position in the 
qualified index, to bucket 12 or 13 of Table 8-36; 
 
(b)  for the risk position in the qualified index which must be assigned to a 
specific sector set out in Table 8-36 corresponding to buckets 1 to 10 of 
Table 8-36 in accordance with sub-paragraph (a) –  
 
(i)  
assign the risk position in the qualified index, to a bucket that 
corresponds to large market capitalisation if 75% or more of the 
constituents of the qualified index, based on the weightings of the 
constituents of the qualified index, have a large market capitalisation. 
In all other cases, the Reporting Bank must assign the risk position 
in the qualified index to a bucket that corresponds to small market 
capitalisation; and 
 
(ii)  assign the risk position in the qualified index, to a bucket that 
corresponds to advanced economy if 75% or more of the constituents 
of the qualified index, based on the weightings of the constituents of 
the qualified index, are from an advanced economy. In all other cases, 
the Reporting Bank must assign the risk position in the qualified index 
to a bucket that corresponds to emerging market economy; and 
 
(c)  for the risk position in the qualified index which must be assigned to bucket 
12 or 13 of Table 8-36 in accordance with sub-paragraph (a), assign the 
risk position in the qualified index, to bucket 12 if 75% or more of the 
constituents of the qualified index, based on the weightings of the 
constituents of the qualified index, have a large market capitalisation and 
are from an advanced economy. In all other cases, the Reporting Bank 
must assign the risk position in the qualified index to bucket 13 of Table 
8-36. 
 
8.5.66  
For the purposes of paragraphs 8.5.62, 8.5.64 and 8.5.65 –  
 
(a) 
a large market capitalisation is a market capitalisation equal to or larger 
than USD 2 billion, and a small market capitalisation is a market 
capitalisation less than USD 2 billion, where –

the Reporting Bank must calculate the market capitalisation of an 
equity or index constituent, as the sum of the market capitalisations, 
based on the market value of total outstanding shares issued by –  
 
(A) the issuer of the equity or index constituent; and  
 
(B)  where applicable, all the issuer’s subsidiaries,  
 
that are listed on an approved exchange or an overseas exchange; 
and 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-218 
 
(ii) 
to avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must not, under any 
circumstances, include in the market capitalisation of an equity or 
index constituent, calculated pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(i), the 
market capitalisations of related corporations of the issuer of the 
equity or index constituent, where such related corporations are not 
subsidiaries848 of the issuer; 
 
(b) 
an advanced economy is the economy of Canada, the United States, 
Mexico, the euro area, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, 
Switzerland, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore or Hong Kong SAR;  
 
(c) 
an emerging market economy is an economy that is not an advanced 
economy; and 
 
(d) 
to assign a risk position to a sector – 
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank must rely on a classification that is commonly 
used in the market for assigning issuers to industry sectors; 
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank must assign each issuer to a sector in Table 8-36, 
and must assign all issuers from the same industry to the same 
sector;

The strike amount of the option on a bond is expressed in terms of the bond price, and not the yield to 
maturity of the bond. 
851  
For a long call option on a bond, the notional amount is zero, since the call option will not be exercised in 
the event of a default of the bond issuer. In this case, a JTD would extinguish the call option’s value and 
this loss would be captured through the P&L term in the gross JTD position calculation.

APPLICATIONS 
OF 
THE 
REQUIREMENTS 
TO 
DETERMINE 
RISK 
FACTOR 
MODELLABILITY 
  
1.1 
Under paragraph 8.3.127, a Reporting Bank is required to demonstrate to the 
Authority that the Reporting Bank is applying the requirements set out in paragraphs 
8.3.128 to 8.3.137 and in this Annex to determine whether a risk factor that has passed 
the risk factor eligibility test can be modelled using the ES model. A Reporting Bank must 
maintain, at a minimum, the following evidence for the purposes of such a demonstration: 
 
(a) 
regression diagnostics for a multi-factor beta model used by the Reporting 
Bank, demonstrating that – 
 
(i) 
the risk factors, estimated coefficients, indices and any other 
regressors included in the multi-factor beta model, are – 
 
(A) adequate to capture both general market risk and idiosyncratic 
risk; and  
 
(B) appropriate for the region and asset class of the instrument and 
is able to explain the general market risk of the instrument, as 
evidenced by goodness-of-fit statistics852 and other diagnostics 
on the coefficients; 
 
(ii) 
where the residuals from the multi-factor model are treated as 
uncorrelated with each other, the residuals from the multi-factor 
model are indeed uncorrelated; and 
 
(iii) where coefficients that are determined based on the Reporting 
Bank’s judgement are used853 – 
 
(A) 
the Reporting Bank’s choice of coefficients is appropriate, with 
reasons why these coefficients cannot be estimated; and 
 
(B) 
the Reporting Bank’s use of the coefficients does not 
underestimate risk; 
 
(b) 
evidence demonstrating that the Reporting Bank periodically checks and 
documents whether the risk factors used in the Reporting Bank’s risk 
model can be fed into front office pricing models to recover the prices of 
the assets concerned854; 
 
(c) 
evidence demonstrating that the Reporting Bank periodically reconciles its 
risk pricing with internal prices from both front office and back office. For 
 
852  
For example, an adjusted-R2 coefficient. 
853  
In general, a risk factor is not considered modellable in cases where parameters are determined based on 
the Reporting Bank’s judgement.  
854  
Where the recovered prices of a risk factor substantially deviate from the actual prices, this may be 
indicative of a problem with the prices used to derive the risk factor, and thus call into question the validity 
of data inputs used to model the risk factor. In such a case, the Authority may determine that the risk 
factor is non-modellable. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-228 
the purposes of this sub-paragraph, the Reporting Bank must ensure that 
the results of such reconciliations include statistics on the differences of 
the risk price from front office and back office prices855; 
 
(d) 
evidence demonstrating that the Reporting Bank periodically conducts risk 
factor backtesting for modelled risk factors by comparing the forecasted 
risk factor returns generated by the Reporting Bank’s risk model with the 
actual risk factor returns produced by front office prices, to confirm that 
the modelled risk factors accurately reflect the volatility and correlations 
of the instruments covered by the risk model. The Reporting Bank may 
conduct such risk factor backtesting on the Reporting Bank’s actual 
portfolio, or on hypothetical portfolios856; 
 
(e) 
where one or more risk factors used in the Reporting Bank’s risk model 
are generated from parameterised models 857, evidence demonstrating 
that – 
 
(i) 
the Reporting Bank periodically updates and recalibrates these risk 
factors as trades occur and new data becomes available; and 
 
(ii) 
where one or more such risk factors are used as a proxy for a single-
name option surface points, the Reporting Bank has defined an 
additional NMRF to account for any potential deviations between the 
proxy and the actual surface point. 
 
 
 
855  
Where a Reporting Bank uses price data from external sources, the Reporting Bank should periodically 
reconcile such external prices with internal prices from both front office and back office, to ensure they do 
not deviate substantially and that they are not consistently biased in any fashion. Where such external 
prices deviate substantially from internal prices from either front office or back office, the Authority may 
determine that the risk factor is non-modellable. 
856  
Risk factor backtesting using hypothetical portfolios that are dependent on key risk factors (or combinations 
thereof) can be useful to identify whether these key risk factors adequately reflect volatility and correlations 
of specific instruments. 
857  
Where a Reporting Bank models risk factors that options are exposed to, the Reporting Bank may –  
(a) 
construct implied volatility surfaces using a parameterised model which may be based on single-name 
underlyings, real price observations of option indices, and/or market quotes of option indices; and 
(b) 
use the moneyness, tenor and option expiry points of liquid options, to calibrate level, volatility, drift 
and correlation risk factor parameters for a volatility surface of a single-name or benchmark.

index of debt securities, into forwards on single debt securities as follows: 
 
(a)  in the case of a single currency basket or index of debt securities – 
 
(i)  
a series of forwards, one for each of the constituent debt securities 
in the basket or index, of an amount which is a proportionate part of 
the total current market value of the underlying securities of the 
contract according to the weighting of the relevant debt security in 
the basket or index; or 
 
(ii)  a single forward on a hypothetical debt security; or 
 
(b) 
in the case of multiple currency baskets or indices of debt securities – 
 
(i) 
a series of forwards (using the method described in sub-paragraph 
(a)(i)); or 
 
(ii) 
a series of forwards, each one on a hypothetical debt security to 
represent one of the currencies in the basket or index, of an amount 
which is a proportionate part of the total current market value of the 
underlying securities of the contract according to the weighting of 
debt securities in the relevant currency in the basket or index, 
 
and treat the resulting positions according to paragraph 1.1 of this Annex.  
 
1.3 
A Reporting Bank must assign the hypothetical debt security in paragraph 
1.2(a)(ii) of this Annex a specific risk charge and a general market risk charge equal to 
the highest that would apply to the debt securities in the basket or index, even if they

relate to different debt securities and regardless of the proportion of those debt securities 
in the basket or index.  
 
 
Interest Rate Futures and FRAs

long (short) FRA as – 
 
(a) 
a notional short (long) position in a zero coupon zero-specific risk security 
with a maturity equal to the sum of the period to expiry of the futures 
contract or settlement date of the FRA and the maturity of the borrowing 
or deposit; and 
 
(b) 
a notional long (short) position in a zero coupon zero-specific risk security 
with maturity equal to the period to expiry of the futures contract or 
settlement date of the FRA. 
 
 
Interest Rate Swaps or Foreign Exchange Swaps

TREATMENT OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IN THE TRADING BOOK 
 
Credit Default Swaps 
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank that is a protection seller (buyer) must treat its position in a 
credit default swap as –  
 
(a)  for the purposes of calculating the general market risk capital requirement 
where any periodic premiums or interest payments are due under the 
swap, a notional long (short) position in a zero-specific risk security with 
a coupon equal to the appropriate fixed or floating rate and a maturity 
equal to the expiry date of the swap or the date on which the interest rate 
will be reset, respectively; and 
 
(b)  for the purposes of calculating the specific risk capital requirement, a 
notional long (short) position in the reference obligation, or where the 
swap is a qualifying debt security858, a long (short) position in the swap, 
with a maturity equal to the expiry date of the swap. 
 
 
Total Return Swaps 
 
1.2 
A Reporting Bank that is a protection seller (buyer) must treat its position in a 
total return swap as –  
  
(a) 
for the purposes of calculating the general market risk capital requirement 
–  
 
(i) 
a notional long (short) position in the reference obligation with a 
maturity equal to the expiry date of the swap, subject to paragraph 
1.3 of this Annex; and 
 
(ii) 
where any periodic premiums or interest payments are due under 
the swap, a notional short (long) position in a zero-specific risk 
security with a coupon equal to the appropriate fixed or floating rate

1.3 
Where a long cash position is hedged by a total return swap (or vice versa) and 
there is an exact match between the reference obligation and the cash position, a 
Reporting Bank that is a protection buyer (seller) may, for the purposes of calculating the 
general market risk capital requirement, treat its position in the total return swap as a 
notional short (long) position in the reference obligation with a maturity equal to the 
maturity date of the reference obligation. 
 
858 
This refers to a security that falls under the “qualifying” category in paragraph 1.1(b) of Annex 8E.

Credit Linked Notes 
 
1.4 
A Reporting Bank that is a protection seller must treat its position in a credit 
linked note as –  
 
(a) 
for the purposes of calculating the general market risk capital requirement,  
a long position in the note issuer with a coupon equal to the appropriate 
fixed or floating rate and a maturity equal to the expiry date of the note

the reference obligation with a maturity equal to the expiry date 
of the note; or 
 
(B)  for a multiple name credit linked note providing proportional 
protection, a notional long position in each of the reference 
obligations according to their respective proportions specified 
in the note. 
 
1.5 
A Reporting Bank that is a protection buyer must treat its position in a credit 
linked note as –

for a single name credit linked note, a notional short position 
in the reference obligation with a maturity equal to the expiry 
date of the note; or 
 
(B) 
for a multiple name credit linked note providing proportional 
protection, a notional short position in each of the reference 
obligations according to their respective proportions specified 
in the note. 
 
 
First-to-default Credit Derivatives 
 
1.6 
A Reporting Bank that is a protection seller (buyer) must treat its position in a 
first-to-default credit derivative as –  
 
(a) 
for the purposes of calculating the general market risk capital requirement 
where any periodic premiums or interest payments are due under the 
credit derivative, a notional long (short) position in a zero-specific risk 
security with a coupon equal to the appropriate fixed or floating rate and 
a maturity equal to the expiry date of the credit derivative or the date on 
which the interest rate will be reset, respectively;  
 
(b) 
for the purposes of calculating the specific risk capital requirement –  
 
(i) 
in the case where the credit derivative is rated by a recognised ECAI,  
a long (short) position in the credit derivative. For such positions, 
the Reporting Bank must use the external credit assessment of the 
credit derivative and calculate the specific risk capital requirement in 
accordance 
with 
the 
specific 
risk 
capital 
requirements 
for 
securitisation exposures in paragraph 8.4.18(a); and  
 
(ii) 
in all other cases, a long (short) position in each of the reference 
obligations in the contract, with the specific risk capital requirement 
for the contract capped at the maximum payout possible under the 
contract. 
 
1.7 
Where a Reporting Bank has a position in one of the reference obligations 
underlying a first-to-default credit derivative, and this credit derivative hedges the position, 
the Reporting Bank may reduce with respect to the hedged amount both the specific risk 
capital requirement for the reference obligation and that part of the specific risk capital 
requirement for the credit derivative that relates to this particular reference obligation.  
 
1.8 
Where a Reporting Bank holds multiple positions in reference obligations 
underlying a first-to-default credit derivative, the Reporting Bank may only offset the 
specific risk capital requirement for the underlying reference obligation with the lowest 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-234 
specific risk capital requirement and that part of the specific risk capital requirement for 
the credit derivative that relates to this particular reference obligation. 
 
 
N-th-to-default Credit Derivatives (with N greater than 1) 
 
1.9 
A Reporting Bank that is a protection seller (buyer) must treat its position in an 
n-th-to-default credit derivative with n greater than 1 as –  
 
(a)  for the purposes of calculating the general market risk capital requirement 
where any periodic premiums or interest payments are due under the 
credit derivative, a notional long (short) position in a zero-specific risk 
security with a coupon equal to the appropriate fixed or floating rate and 
a maturity equal to the expiry date of the credit derivative or the date on 
which the interest rate will be reset, respectively;  
 
(b)  for the purposes of calculating the specific risk capital requirement –  
 
(i) 
in the case where the credit derivative is rated by a recognised ECAI, 
a long (short) position in the credit derivative. For such positions, 
the Reporting Bank must use the external credit assessment of the 
credit derivative and calculate the specific risk capital requirement in 
accordance 
with 
the 
specific 
risk 
capital 
requirements 
for 
securitisation exposures in paragraph 8.4.18(a); and 
 
(ii) 
in all other cases, a long (short) position in each of the reference 
obligations in the contract but disregarding the (n-1) obligations with 
the lowest specific risk capital requirements, with the specific risk 
capital requirement capped at the maximum payout possible under 
the contract.  
  
1.10 
For n-th-to-default credit derivatives with n greater than 1, a Reporting Bank 
must not offset the specific risk capital requirements against that of any underlying 
reference obligation.  
 
1.11 
Where a Reporting Bank has a position in an n-th-to-m-th-to-default credit 
derivative with n and m both greater than 1 and m greater than n, the Reporting Bank 
must decompose the position into equivalent positions in individual n-th-to-default credit 
derivatives861, and treat these equivalent positions in accordance with paragraphs 1.9 and 
1.10 of this Annex. 
 
1.12 
A Reporting Bank must apply the capital requirements against each net n-th-
to-default credit derivative position (including first-to-default credit derivative positions) 
irrespective of whether the Reporting Bank provides or obtains protection.  
 
1.13 
For the purposes of paragraphs 1.6(b)(i) and 1.9(b)(i) of this Annex, where a 
security has more than one external credit assessment and these map into different credit 
quality grades, a Reporting Bank must apply paragraph 7.3.30. 
 
 
861  
For example, for a 5th-to-8th default product, a Reporting Bank must decompose it into a 5th-to-default 
product, 6th-to-default product, 7th-to-default product and 8th-to-default product.

1.2 
For the purposes of paragraphs 1.1(b)(ii) and (iii) and 1.4(b) of this Annex, 
where a security has more than one external credit assessment and these map into 
different quality grades, a Reporting Bank must apply paragraph 7.3.30.  
 
1.3

(a) 
the Singapore Government or the Authority, which is denominated in 
Singapore dollars and funded by the Reporting Bank in Singapore dollars; 
 
(b) 
other central governments with a credit quality grade of “3” or better as

(c) 
a PSE which is risk-weighted at 0% under the SA(CR) pursuant to 
paragraph 7.3.48 and Table 7-3.  
  


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-239 
1.5 
The Authority may, at its discretion, direct a Reporting Bank to assign a higher 
specific risk charge other than the specific risk charges mentioned in paragraph 1.4 of this 
Annex and Table 8E-1 to securities issued by certain governments or PSEs.862 
  
1.6 
For securities in the “others” category which have a high yield to redemption 
relative to government debt securities issued in the same country or jurisdiction, the 
Authority may do either or both of the following:  
  
(a) 
apply a higher specific risk charge to such securities;  
 
(b) 
disallow offsetting for the purposes of defining the extent of general 
market risk between such securities and any other debt securities. 
 
 
 
862  
This may apply especially in cases where the securities are denominated in a currency other than that of 
the issuing government, or that of the government of the issuing PSE, respectively.

ILLUSTRATION ON THE CALCULATION OF THE GENERAL MARKET RISK CAPITAL 
REQUIREMENT FOR INTEREST RATE RISK UNDER THE MATURITY METHOD 
 
1.1 
 A Reporting Bank may have all of the following positions: 
 
(a)  a qualifying bond863, $13.33 million market value, remaining maturity 8 
years, coupon 8%; 
 
(b)  a government bond, $75 million market value, remaining maturity 2 
months, coupon 7%; 
 
(c)  an interest rate swap, $150 million, in respect of which the Reporting Bank 
receives floating rate interest and pays fixed, next interest fixing after 9 
months, remaining life of swap is 8 years (assume the current interest 
rate is identical to the one on which the swap is based);  
 
(d)  a long position in an interest rate future, $50 million, delivery date after 
6 months, life of underlying government security is 3.5 years (assume the 
current interest rate is identical to the one on which the interest rate future 
is based).  
 
1.2 
 
Assuming that all the coupons or interest rates are more than 3%, a Reporting 
Bank must record these positions as positions in a maturity slotting table and apply risk 
charges to them in accordance with Table 8E-2. 
 
1.3 
 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the maturity band requirement by multiplying 
the total amount matched within each maturity band by the maturity band matching factor 
of 10%. In this example, there are partially offsetting long and short positions in the 10th 
maturity band, the matched amount of which is equal to $500,000. This results in a vertical 
disallowance of $50,000. 
 
1.4  
 
A Reporting Bank must then calculate its horizontal disallowances comprising 
–  
 
(a)  the zone requirement, by multiplying the total amount matched within 
each zone by the corresponding zone matching factor in Table 8E-4. In 
this example, a zone requirement would be calculated for Zone 1 
amounting to 40% of the total matched amount of $200,000. This results 
in a horizontal disallowance within the zones of $80,000. There is no zone 
requirement if offsetting does not occur within a zone; 
 
(b)  the adjacent zone requirement, by multiplying the total amount matched 
between adjacent zones by the adjacent zone factor in Table 8E-4. In this 
example, the following positions remain unmatched after sub-paragraph 
(a): Zone 1 +$1,000,000, Zone 2 +$1,125,000, Zone 3 -$5,125,000. The 
adjacent zone matching factor of 40% would apply to the matched amount 
of $1,125,000 between Zones 2 and 3. This results in a horizontal 
disallowance between adjacent zones of $450,000; and  
 
863 
This refers to a security that falls under the “qualifying” category in paragraph 1.1(b) of Annex 8E. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
8-243 
 
(c)  the non-adjacent zone requirement, by multiplying the total amount 
matched between Zones 1 and 3. In this example, the following positions 
remain unmatched after sub-paragraph (b): Zone 1 +$1,000,000, Zone 3 
-$4,000,000. The non-adjacent zone factor of 100% would apply to the 
matched amount of $1,000,000 resulting in a horizontal disallowance 
between Zones 1 and 3 of $1,000,000.  
 
1.5  
 
Finally, the Reporting Bank must calculate a net position requirement for the 
residual unmatched amount. In this example this amounts to $3,000,000. 
 
1.6  
 
The general market risk capital requirement is the sum of the maturity band 
requirement, the zone requirement, the adjacent zone requirement, the non-adjacent 
zone requirement and the net position requirement. In this example, the general market 
risk capital requirement would be $50,000 + $80,000 + $450,000 + $1,000,000 + 
$3,000,000 = $4,580,000.

Bank would make if it did convert to equity; or 
 
(ii)  a reduction equal to the current value of any profit which the 
Reporting Bank would make if it did convert to equity, subject to a 
maximum reduction equal to the equity position on the notional 
position underlying the convertible financial instrument.

that equity's contribution to the total market value of the equities in the 
index or basket; or 
 
(b)  if there is –  
 
(i)  
one country or jurisdiction in the index or basket, a notional position 
in the index or basket with a value equal to the total market value 
of the equities in the index or basket; or 
 
(ii)  more than one country or jurisdiction in the index or basket –  


Monetary Authority of Singapore

jurisdiction’s contribution to the total market value of the 
equities in the index or basket; or 
 
(B)  one notional basket position in a separate, hypothetical country 
or jurisdiction with a value equal to the total market value of 
the equities in the index or basket. 
 
1.5 
In the case of a futures contract, forward or CFD on a single equity, equity index 
or equity basket, a Reporting Bank must treat any interest rate risk or foreign exchange 
risk arising from the non-equity leg of the futures contract, forward or CFD in accordance 
with the requirements set out in Sub-divisions 2 and 4 of Division 4 of Part VIII, 
respectively. 
 
 
 
Equity Swaps 
 
1.6 
A Reporting Bank must treat an equity swap where the Reporting Bank is 
receiving an amount based on the change in value of a single equity or equity index and 
paying an amount based on the change in value of another equity or equity index as a 
notional long position in the former and a notional short position in the latter.  
 
1.7 
Where one of the legs of an equity swap involves receiving or paying, a fixed 
or floating interest rate, a Reporting Bank must slot that exposure into the appropriate re-
pricing time-band for interest rate risk as set out in Sub-division 2 of Division 4 of Part 
VIII.

DERIVATION OF NOTIONAL POSITIONS FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY AND GOLD 
DERIVATIVES 
 
 
Foreign Exchange Forwards, Futures Contracts, Contract for Differences 
(“CFD”s) 
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank must treat a foreign exchange forward, futures contract or 
CFD as 2 notional currency positions: 
 
(a)  a long notional position in the currency which the Reporting Bank has 
contracted to buy; and 
 
(b)  a short notional position in the currency which the Reporting Bank has 
contracted to sell, 
 
where each notional position has a value equal to the present value864 of the amount of 
each currency to be exchanged in the case of a forward or futures contract. 
 
 
 
Foreign Exchange Swaps 
 
1.2  
A Reporting Bank must treat a foreign exchange swap as –  
 
(a)  a long notional position in the currency which the Reporting Bank has 
contracted to receive interest and principal; and 
 
(b)  a short notional position in the currency which the Reporting Bank has 
contracted to pay interest and principal, 
 
where each notional position has a value equal to the present value amount of all cash 
flows in the relevant currency. 
 
 
Gold Forwards, Futures Contract and CFDs 
 
1.3  
A Reporting Bank must treat a forward, futures contract or CFD on gold as a 
notional position in gold with a value equal to the amount of gold underlying the contract 
multiplied by the current spot price for gold, except in the case of a forward where the 
Reporting Bank, in accordance with industry norms, may use the net present value of each 
position, discounted using prevailing interest rates and valued at prevailing spot rates.  
 
1.4 
In the case of a futures contract, forward or CFD on gold, a Reporting Bank 
must treat any interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk arising from the non-gold leg of 
the futures contract, forward or CFD in accordance with the requirements set out in Sub-
divisions 2 and 4 of Division 4 of Part VIII, respectively. 
 
864  
This is normally equal to the amount underlying the contract multiplied by the current spot price, except in 
the case of a forward where the Reporting Bank, in accordance with industry norms, may use the net 
present value of each position, discounted using prevailing interest rates and valued at prevailing spot rates.

commodity which settles according to the difference between the price set on trade date 
and that prevailing at the maturity date of the contract as a notional position equal to the 
total quantity of the commodity underlying the contract that has a maturity equal to the 
expiry date of the contract. 
 
 
Commitment to Buy or Sell a Single Commodity at an Average of Spot Prices 
Prevailing in the Future 
 
1.2  
A Reporting Bank must treat a commitment to buy (sell) at the average spot 
price of a single commodity prevailing over some period between trade date and maturity 
date as a combination of –  
 
(a)  a long (short) position equal to the total quantity of the commodity 
underlying the contract with a maturity equal to the maturity date of the 
contract; and 
 
(b)  a series of short (long) notional positions, one for each of the reference 
dates where the contract price remains unfixed, each of which is a

which settles according to the difference between the price set on trade date and that 
prevailing at the maturity date of the contract as either –  
 
(a)  a single notional commodity position (separate from all other commodities) 
equal to the total quantity of the commodities underlying the contract that 
has a maturity equal to the maturity date of the contract; or 
 
(b)  a series of notional positions, one for each of the constituent commodities 
in the index, each of which is a proportionate part of the total quantity of 
the commodities underlying the contract according to the weighting of the 
relevant commodity in the index and has a maturity equal to the maturity 
date of the contract. 
 
1.4 
In the case of a futures contract, forward or CFD on a single commodity or 
commodity index, a Reporting Bank must treat any interest rate risk or foreign exchange 
risk from the non-commodity leg of the futures contract, forward or CFD in accordance 
with the requirements set out in Sub-divisions 2 and 4 of Division 4 of Part VIII, 
respectively.

Commodity Swaps 
 
1.5  
A Reporting Bank must treat a commodity swap as a series of notional positions, 
one for each payment under the swap, each of which equals the total quantity of the 
commodity underlying the contract, has a maturity corresponding to each payment and is 
long or short as follows: 
 
 
Receiving amounts 
unrelated to any 
commodity’s price 
Receiving the price of 
commodity ‘b’ 
Paying amounts 
unrelated to any 
commodity’s price 
N.A. 
Long positions in 
commodity ‘b’ 
Paying the price of 
commodity ‘a’ 
Short positions in 
commodity ‘a’ 
Short positions in 
commodity ‘a’ and long 
positions in commodity 
‘b’ 
 
 
1.6 
Where one of the legs of a commodity swap involves receiving or paying, a fixed 
or floating interest rate, a Reporting Bank must slot that exposure into the appropriate re-
pricing time-band for interest rate risk as set out in Sub-division 2 of Division 4 of Part 
VIII.

ILLUSTRATION ON THE CALCULATION OF THE MARKET RISK CAPITAL 
REQUIREMENT FOR OPTIONS UNDER THE SIMPLIFIED APPROACH 
 
1.1  
Assuming a Reporting Bank holds 100 shares currently valued at $10 each and 
an equivalent put option with a strike price of $11, the Reporting Bank must calculate its 
market risk capital requirement as follows: $1,000 x 16% (i.e. 8% specific risk + 8% 
general market risk) = $160, less the amount the option is in the money ($11 - $10) x 
100 = $100. In this example, the market risk capital requirement of the Reporting Bank 
would be $60. 
 
1.2  
A Reporting Bank must apply a similar methodology as that mentioned in 
paragraph 1.1 of this Annex for options whose underlying is a foreign currency, an interest 
rate-related instrument or a commodity.

Annex 8M 
 
ILLUSTRATION ON THE CALCULATION OF THE MARKET RISK CAPITAL 
REQUIREMENT FOR OPTIONS UNDER THE DELTA-PLUS METHOD  
 
1.1  
Assume a Reporting Bank has a European short call option on a commodity with 
an exercise price of 490 and a market value of the underlying commodity 12 months from 
the expiration of the option at 500, a risk-free interest rate at 8% per annum, and the 
volatility at 20%. The current delta for this position is according to the Black-Scholes 
formula -0.721 (i.e. the price of the option changes by -0.721 if the price of the underlying 
commodity moves by one). The gamma is -0.0034 (i.e. the delta changes by -0.0034 
(from -0.721 to -0.7244) if the price of the underlying commodity moves by one). The 
current value of the option is 65.48.  
 
1.2  
The following example shows how the market risk capital requirement will be 
calculated according to the delta-plus method: 
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank must calculate the delta-weighted position by 
multiplying the current market value of the commodity by the absolute 
value of the delta.  
 
500 x 0.721 = 360.5 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank must incorporate the delta-weighted position into the 
measure described in Sub-division 5 of Division 4 of Part VIII on 
Commodity Risk. If the Reporting Bank uses the maturity ladder approach 
and no other positions exist, the Reporting Bank must multiply the delta-
weighted position by the outright charge of 15% to calculate the capital 
requirement for delta. 
 
360.5 x 0.15 = 54.075 
 
(c)  the Reporting Bank must calculate the capital requirement for gamma in 
accordance with paragraphs 8.4.73 to 8.4.76. 
 
1/2 x 0.0034 x (500 x 0.15)² = 9.5625 
 
(d)  the Reporting Bank must calculate the capital requirement for vega risk. 
Assuming that the current (implied) volatility is 20%, as only an increase 
in volatility carries a risk of loss for a short call option, the volatility has to 
be increased by a relative shift of 25%. This means that the Reporting 
Bank must calculate the vega risk capital requirement on the basis of a 
change in volatility of 5% from 20% to 25% in this example. According to 
the Black-Scholes formula used, the vega risk equals 1.68. Thus, a 1% or 
0.01 increase in volatility increases the value of the option by 1.68. 
Accordingly, a change in volatility of 5% increases the value by – 
 
5 x 1.68 = 8.4 
 
which is the capital requirement for vega risk. 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

(e)  the Reporting Bank must calculate the market risk capital requirement in 
this example as follows: 54.075 + 9.5625 + 8.4 = 72.0375.

DETERMINING 
DELTA-WEIGHTED 
POSITIONS 
FOR 
INTEREST RATE OPTIONS  
 
1.1  
In the case of a bought call option on a June 3-month interest rate future, a 
Reporting Bank must in April treat the option as a long position with a maturity of 5 months 
and a short position with a maturity of 2 months. The Reporting Bank must delta-weight 
both positions.  
 
1.2 
In the case of a written option on a June 3-month interest rate future, a 
Reporting Bank must in April treat the option as a long position with a maturity of 2 months 
and a short position with a maturity of 5 months. The Reporting Bank must delta-weight 
both positions.  
 
1.3  
A Reporting Bank must in April treat a 2-month call option on a 10-year bond 
future where delivery of the bond takes place in September as a long bond position with 
a maturity of 10 years 5 months and a short 5 months deposit position. The Reporting 
Bank must delta-weight both positions. 
 
1.4  
A Reporting Bank must treat caps and floors as a series of European options. 
For example, a Reporting Bank that buys a 2-year cap with semi-annual resets and a cap 
rate of 15% must treat the cap as a series of bought call options on a FRA with a reference 
rate of 15%, each with a negative sign at the maturity date of the underlying FRA and a 
positive sign at the settlement date of the underlying FRA.  
 
1.5 
 
A Reporting Bank must treat floating rate instruments with caps or floors as a 
combination of floating rate securities and a series of European options. For example, a 
Reporting Bank that buys a 3-year floating rate bond indexed to 6-month LIBOR with a 
cap of 15% must treat the position as a debt security that reprices in 6 months and a 
series of 5 written call options on an FRA with a reference rate of 15%, each with a positive 
sign at the maturity date of the underlying FRA and a negative sign at the settlement date 
of the underlying FRA.

PART IX:  OPERATIONAL RISK  
 
 
Division 1:  SA(OR) 
 
Sub-division 1:  Calculation of Operational Risk Capital Requirement 
 
9.1.1 
A Reporting Bank must calculate its operational RWA as –  
 
(a)  at the Group level, 12.5 times the operational risk requirement calculated 
in paragraph 9.1.2, based on consolidated figures of the banking group 
for the calculation of the BI in paragraph 9.1.3 and the ILM in paragraph 
9.1.2(b); and 
 
(b)  at the Solo level, 12.5 times the operational risk requirement calculated 
in paragraph 9.1.2, based on standalone figures of the Reporting Bank for 
the calculation of the BI in paragraph 9.1.3 and the ILM in paragraph 
9.1.2(b). 
 
9.1.2 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the operational risk capital requirement (𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶) 
based on the SA(OR) as follows: 
 
𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶= 𝐵𝐼𝐶× 𝐼𝐿𝑀 
 
where – 
 
(a)  BIC is the Business Indicator Component and is calculated as the  
sum of901 – 
 
(i) 
12% of the Reporting Bank’s BI;  
 
(ii) 
if the Reporting Bank’s BI exceeds S$1.5 billion, 3% of the amount 
by which the BI exceeds S$1.5 billion; and  
 
(iii) if the Reporting Bank’s BI exceeds S$45 billion, 3% of the amount 
by which the BI exceeds S$45 billion; and  
 
(b)  subject to paragraphs 9.1.8(a), 9.1.10 and 9.1.15, ILM is the Internal Loss 
Multiplier and is calculated as follows: 
 
𝐼𝐿𝑀= ln (exp(1) −1 + ( 𝐿𝐶
𝐵𝐼𝐶)
0.8
) 
 
where –  
 
(i)  
LC is the loss component and is equal to 15 times the Reporting 
Bank’s average annual net losses incurred over the past 10 
consecutive financial years or the observation period of the internal 
 
901  
For example, given a BI of S$50 billion, BIC = (S$50 billion x 12%) + [(S$50 billion – S$1.5 billion) x 3%] 
+ [(S$50 billion – S$45 billion) x 3%] = S$7.605 billion.

loss data as set out in paragraph 9.1.14 or 9.1.15, whichever is 
applicable; and 
 
(ii) 
BIC is defined in accordance with sub-paragraph (a). 
 
9.1.3 
For the purposes of paragraph 9.1.2(a), BI is calculated using the following 
formula: 
 
𝐵𝐼= 𝐼𝐿𝐷𝐶+ 𝑆𝐶+ 𝐹𝐶 
 
where – 
 
(a)  ILDC is the interest, leases and dividend component and is calculated 
using the following formula:  
 
𝐼𝐿𝐷𝐶= min(abs(interest income −interest expenses)
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅, 2.25% ×

̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅) + dividend income
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅; 
 
(b)  SC is the services component and is calculated using the following 
formula:  
 
𝑆𝐶=
max(fee and commission income
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅, fee and commission expenses
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅) +
max(other operating income
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅, other operating expenses
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅); and 
 
(c)  FC is the financial component and is calculated using the following 
formula:  
 
𝐹𝐶= abs(Net P&L on the trading book)
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ +
abs(Net P&L on the banking book)
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅; 
 
and where –  
 
(i)  
a bar above a term means that it is calculated as the average over the 
past 3 consecutive financial years; 
 
(ii)  abs() is the absolute value of the terms within the brackets;  
 
(iii) the absolute value of net items902 must be calculated first for each financial 
year, and the average of the past 3 consecutive financial years must be 
calculated based on the absolute value of net items for each financial year;  
 
(iv)  the definitions of each of the components of the BI are set out in Annex 
9A; and 
 
(v) 
the calculations of the components of the BI must be based on the past 3 
consecutive financial years of the Reporting Bank’s audited year-end 
financial statements. Where the audited year-end financial statements for 
 
902  
For example, interest income less any interest expenses. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
9-3 
the most recent financial year are not available, the Reporting Bank may 
use the unaudited year-end financial statements for the most recent 
financial year, provided that the Reporting Bank reconciles the 
components of the BI calculated based on its unaudited year-end financial 
statements for the most recent financial year with those calculated based 
on its audited year-end financial statements for the most recent financial 
year, once available. If the reconciliation indicates that there are material 
differences between the components of the BI calculated based on 
unaudited year-end financial statements for the most recent financial year 
which have been submitted to the Authority under the reporting schedules 
in Part XII, and those calculated based on audited year-end financial 
statements for the most recent financial year, the Reporting Bank must 
resubmit to the Authority all relevant reporting schedules in Part XII with 
the components of the BI calculated based on audited year-end financial 
statements for the most recent financial year, and other calculations based 
on the BI updated accordingly, as soon as practicable after the audited 
year-end financial statements become available. In all other cases, where 
a Reporting Bank does not have audited year-end financial statements for 
the past 3 consecutive financial years, it must obtain the Authority’s 
written approval to use an alternative calculation methodology. 
 
[MAS Notice 637 (Amendment) 2024] 
 
9.1.4 
For the purposes of the calculation of the LC or the BI under the SA(OR), a past 
number (“X”) of consecutive financial years903 refers to904 –  
 
(a) 
in the case where the LC or the BI, whichever is applicable, is being 
calculated as of the last day of a financial year (“A”), the period of X 
consecutive financial years ending on the last day of financial year A; and 
 
(b) 
in any other case, the period of X consecutive financial years immediately 
preceding the date as of which the LC or the BI, whichever is applicable, 
is being calculated. 
 
9.1.5  
For the purposes of the calculation of the ILDC in paragraph 9.1.3(a), a 
Reporting Bank must include all outstanding credit obligations on non-accrued status905. 
 
9.1.6  
For the purposes of the calculation of the BI in paragraph 9.1.3, a Reporting 
Bank must not include any of the following profit or loss items in any of the components 
of the BI: 
 
 
903  
For example, in each of paragraph 9.1.3(i), 9.1.3(iii) and 9.1.3(v), X is 3.  
904  
As an example, for the purposes of calculating the BI under the SA(OR) for a Reporting Bank whose financial 
year ends on 31 December 2023 – 
(a) for its submission in respect of the BI as of 31 December 2023, the “past 3 consecutive financial years” 
would refer to 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023; and 
(b) for its submissions in respect of the BI as of 31 March 2024, 30 June 2024 or 30 September 2024 (as 
the case may be), the “past 3 consecutive financial years” would also refer to 1 January 2021 to  
31 December 2023. 
905  
For example, non-performing loans.

(a)  income or expenses from insurance businesses except where the 
Reporting Bank does not assume any risk or undertake any liability as part 
of the insurance business906; 
 
(b)  premiums paid for or reimbursements or payments received from 
insurance or reinsurance policies purchased; 
 
(c)  administrative expenses, including staff expenses, outsourcing fees paid 
for the supply of non-financial services907, and other administrative 
expenses908; 
 
(d)  recovery of administrative expenses including recovery of payments on 
behalf of customers909; 
 
(e)  expenses of premises or fixed assets (except when these expenses result 
from operational loss events); 
 
(f)  depreciation or amortisation of tangible or intangible assets (except 
depreciation related to operating lease assets, which must be included in 
financial and operating lease expenses); 
 
(g)  provisions or reversal of provisions910 except for provisions related to 
operational loss events; 
 
(h)  expenses due to share capital repayable on demand; 
 
(i)  
impairment or reversal of impairment911; 
 
(j)  changes in goodwill recognised in profit or loss; 
 
(k)  corporate income tax, including current tax and deferred tax. 
 
9.1.7 
For the purposes of the calculation of the BI in paragraph 9.1.3, a Reporting 
Bank –  
 
(a)  may exclude items arising from divested businesses from the calculation 
of the BI with immediate effect upon obtaining the written approval of the 
Authority. The Reporting Bank must report the operational RWA taking 
into account such exclusion in the next quarterly submission of reporting 
schedules under Part XII, after obtaining the written approval of the 
Authority for the exclusion; and  
 
(b)  must include every business acquired by the Reporting Bank and every 
entity merged with the Reporting Bank, in the calculation of the BI, with 
immediate effect after each respective acquisition or merger. The

911  
For example, impairment on financial assets, non-financial assets, investments in subsidiaries, joint 
ventures and associates. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
9-5 
Reporting Bank must incorporate, in its calculation of its BI, audited 
financial information (from before the acquisition or merger, as the case 
may be) of a business that is acquired or an entity that is merged, for the 
period relevant to the BI calculation. The Reporting Bank must report the 
operational RWA taking into account such inclusion in the next quarterly 
submission of reporting schedules under Part XII. Where a Reporting Bank 
does not have audited financial information (from before the acquisition 
or merger, as the case may be) of any business that is acquired or any 
entity that is merged, it must obtain the Authority’s written approval to 
use an alternative calculation methodology.  
 
9.1.8 
For the purposes of the calculation of 𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶 in paragraph 9.1.2 – 
 
(a)  a Reporting Bank with a BI less than or equal to S$1.5 billion must set the 
ILM equal to one in the calculation of 𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶 in paragraph 9.1.2 (that is, 
calculate 𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶 based solely on the BIC), unless the Reporting Bank has 
obtained the Authority’s written approval to calculate the ILM in 
accordance with paragraph 9.1.2(b) for the calculation of 𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶. The 
Authority will not grant such approval unless the Reporting Bank meets all 
the criteria set out in paragraphs 9.1.16 to 9.1.41; and 
 
(b)  a Reporting Bank with a BI more than S$1.5 billion must calculate the ILM 
in accordance with paragraph 9.1.2(b) in the calculation of 𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶. 
 
 
Sub-division 2:  Criteria on Internal Loss Data Identification, Collection and 
Treatment 
 
9.1.9 
When either of the following applies, a Reporting Bank must ensure that it 
meets all the criteria set out in paragraphs 9.1.16 to 9.1.41 and must be able to 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that it has met all the criteria set out in 
paragraphs 9.1.16 to 9.1.41:  
 
(a)  the Reporting Bank has a BI less than or equal to S$1.5 billion and has 
obtained the Authority’s written approval to calculate the ILM in 
accordance with paragraph 9.1.2(b) for the calculation of 𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶;  
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank has a BI more than S$1.5 billion. 
 
A Reporting Bank referred to in paragraph 9.1.9(a) or paragraph 9.1.9(b) is referred to in 
this Sub-division and Annex 9B as a “Relevant Reporting Bank”. 
 
9.1.10 
Where a Relevant Reporting Bank fails to meet any of the criteria set out in 
paragraphs 9.1.16 to 9.1.41 as required by paragraph 9.1.9, the Relevant Reporting Bank 
must set the ILM equal to one, or greater than one if required by the Authority, in the 
calculation of 𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶 in paragraph 9.1.2. The Relevant Reporting Bank must continue to set 
the ILM equal to one, or greater than one if required by the Authority, until the Relevant 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
9-6 
Reporting Bank has been notified by the Authority that the Relevant Reporting Bank may 
calculate the ILM in accordance with paragraph 9.1.2(b) for the calculation of 𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶.912 
 
9.1.11 
Nothing in paragraph 9.1.10 prejudices or affects any right of the Authority to 
take any action, including any regulatory action, for any breach by a Relevant Reporting 
Bank of paragraph 9.1.9.  
 
9.1.12 
To avoid doubt, each of the following is treated as a separate breach of this 
Notice: 
 
(a)  a failure by a Relevant Reporting Bank to comply with paragraph 9.1.9; 
 
(b)  a failure by a Relevant Reporting Bank to comply with paragraph 9.1.10. 
 
9.1.13 
Subject to paragraphs 9.1.14 and 9.1.15, a Relevant Reporting Bank must 
ensure that its internal loss data used for the calculation of the LC is based on an 
observation period of the past 10 consecutive financial years, and the Relevant Reporting 
Bank must meet the criteria set out in paragraphs 9.1.16 to 9.1.41 in relation to the 
internal loss data. 
 
9.1.14 
Despite paragraph 9.1.13, where a Relevant Reporting Bank does not have 
internal loss data for the past 10 consecutive financial years in relation to which the 
Relevant Reporting Bank meets the criteria set out in paragraphs 9.1.16 to 9.1.41, the 
Relevant Reporting Bank may, subject to the Authority’s written approval, use a minimum 
observation period of the past 5 consecutive financial years of internal loss data for the 
calculation of the LC, provided that the Relevant Reporting Bank meets the criteria set out 
in paragraphs 9.1.16 to 9.1.41 in relation to the internal loss data. Where such approval 
is granted by the Authority, the Relevant Reporting Bank must include all past consecutive 
financial years of internal loss data available for the calculation of the LC, including internal 
loss data that is available beyond the past 5 consecutive financial years, provided that the 
Relevant Reporting Bank meets the criteria set out in paragraphs 9.1.16 to 9.1.41 in 
relation to the internal loss data.  
 
9.1.15 
Despite paragraph 9.1.13, where a Relevant Reporting Bank referred to in 
paragraph 9.1.9(b) does not have internal loss data for at least the past 5 consecutive 
financial years in relation to which the Relevant Reporting Bank meets the criteria set out 
in paragraphs 9.1.16 to 9.1.41, the Authority may require the Relevant Reporting Bank to 
use less than 5 consecutive financial years of internal loss data for the calculation of the 
LC, if – 
 
(a)  the Relevant Reporting Bank meets the criteria set out in paragraphs 
9.1.16 to 9.1.41 in relation to the internal loss data;  
 
(b)  the Relevant Reporting Bank’s ILM is greater than one; and  
 
(c)  the Authority believes the losses are representative of the Relevant 
Reporting Bank’s operational risk exposure.  
 
 
912  
The Authority will consider whether the Relevant Reporting Bank has remedied the deficiencies and 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Authority that it is able to meet all the criteria set out in paragraphs 
9.1.16 to 9.1.41. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
9-7 
Otherwise, the Relevant Reporting Bank must set the ILM equal to one in the calculation 
of 𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶 in paragraph 9.1.2 (that is, calculate 𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶 based solely on the BIC). 
 
 
 General Criteria 
 
9.1.16 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must have documented procedures and processes 
for the identification, collection and treatment of internal loss data, and must subject such 
procedures and processes to –  
 
(a)  validation before the Relevant Reporting Bank’s use of the internal loss 
data for the calculation of 𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶; and  
 
(b)  regular reviews by IA or an external third party independent of the 
Relevant Reporting Bank. 
 
9.1.17 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must ensure that its internal loss data captures all 
activities and exposures from all geographic locations and systems.  
 
9.1.18  
A Relevant Reporting Bank must have processes to independently review the 
comprehensiveness and accuracy of its internal loss data. 
 
9.1.19 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must map its internal loss data into the relevant 
Level 1 operational loss event type categories as defined in Table 9B-1 and must document 
the criteria for allocating operational risk losses to the specified Level 1 operational loss 
event type categories. The Relevant Reporting Bank must provide the mapping of its 
internal loss data, and the criteria for allocating operational risk losses, to the relevant 
Level 1 operational loss event type category as set out in Table 9B-1 to the Authority upon 
request.  
 
9.1.20 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must include an operational loss event in its internal 
loss data set if the net loss of that operational loss event, calculated in accordance with 
paragraph 9.1.22, is equal to or above S$30,000.  
 
9.1.21 
For the purposes of the calculation of the LC in paragraph 9.1.2(b)(i) – 
 
(a) 
a Relevant Reporting Bank referred to in paragraph 9.1.9(a) must include 
an operational loss event if the net loss of that operational loss event, 
calculated in accordance with paragraph 9.1.22, is equal to or above 
S$30,000; and 
 
(b) 
a Relevant Reporting Bank referred to in paragraph 9.1.9(b) must include 
an operational loss event if the net loss of that operational loss event, 
calculated in accordance with paragraph 9.1.22, is equal to or above 
S$150,000. 
 
9.1.22 
For the purposes of calculating the LC, a Relevant Reporting Bank must 
calculate the net loss of an operational loss event by summing all of the operational loss 
event’s gross losses inside the calculation window of past 10 consecutive financial years 
or the observation period of the internal loss data as set out in paragraph 9.1.14 or 9.1.15, 
whichever is applicable, and subtracting all recoveries inside the calculation window of 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
9-8 
past 10 consecutive financial years or the observation period of the internal loss data as 
set out in paragraph 9.1.14 or 9.1.15, whichever is applicable. A Relevant Reporting Bank 
must use the date of accounting of the gross losses and recoveries to determine whether 
they are inside the calculation window of past 10 consecutive financial years or the 
observation period of the internal loss data as set out in paragraph 9.1.14 or 9.1.15, 
whichever is applicable. For a legal event, the Relevant Reporting Bank must use the date 
when a reserve is recognised for the potential loss impact, as the date of accounting. A 
Relevant Reporting Bank must ensure that tax effects913 are not included as recoveries.  
 
9.1.23 
To avoid doubt, for the purposes of paragraphs 9.1.20 and 9.1.21, a Relevant 
Reporting Bank must include an operational loss event in its internal loss data set and in 
the calculation of the LC in paragraph 9.1.2(b)(i), if the cumulative net loss impact of the 
operational loss event in the calculation window of past 10 consecutive financial years or 
the observation period of the internal loss data as set out in paragraph 9.1.14 or 9.1.15, 
whichever is applicable, is equal to or above the relevant thresholds stated in paragraphs 
9.1.20 and 9.1.21, even if the operational loss event does not result in a net loss equal to 
or above the relevant threshold stated in paragraphs 9.1.20 and 9.1.21 in any individual 
financial year.914 
 
9.1.24 
Subject to paragraphs 9.1.20 and 9.1.21, for operational loss events arising 
from a Relevant Reporting Bank’s activities that are outsourced to service providers 
external to the Relevant Reporting Bank, the Relevant Reporting Bank must include 
financial impacts of operational loss events that are payable by the Relevant Reporting 
Bank and exclude financial impacts of operational loss events that are payable by the 
service provider (rather than by the Relevant Reporting Bank) in its internal loss data set.  
 
9.1.25 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must convert its operational risk losses denominated 
in a foreign currency into Singapore dollars using the same exchange rate that the 
Relevant Reporting Bank uses to convert these operational risk losses in the Relevant 
Reporting Bank’s financial statements of the period the operational risk losses were 
accounted for.  
 
9.1.26 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must collect all of the following information for each 
operational loss event: 
 
(a)  the gross loss amounts; 
 
(b)  reference dates of the operational loss event, including –  
 
(i)  
the date when the operational loss event happened or first began 
(“date of occurrence”), where available;  
 
 
913  
For example, reductions in corporate income tax liability due to operational risk losses. 
914  
For example, a Relevant Reporting Bank referred to in paragraph 9.1.9(a) must, when determining its 𝐾𝑂𝑅𝐶 
using a calculation window of financial years 2012 to 2021 –  
(a)  include in its internal loss data set and in its calculation of the LC, an operational loss event that results 
in a net loss impact of S$24,000 in 2012 and S$10,500 in 2012, because the net loss of the operational 
loss event inside the calculation window is S$34,500; and 
(b)  exclude from its internal loss data set and in its calculation of the LC, an operational loss event that 
results in a net loss impact of S$1.5 million in 2010 (outside of the calculation window), a net loss 
impact of S$450,000 in 2013 (inside the calculation window), and a recovery of S$750,000 in 2015 
(inside the calculation window), because the net loss of the operational loss event inside the calculation 
window is negative. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
9-9 
(ii)  the date on which the Relevant Reporting Bank became aware of the 
operational loss event (“date of discovery”); and 
 
(iii) the date (or dates) when the operational loss event resulted in a loss, 
or when a reserve or provision was recognised against the potential 
loss impact, in the Relevant Reporting Bank’s accounts (“date of 
accounting”). To avoid doubt, for a loss referred to in paragraph 
9.1.31(d), the date of accounting refers to the date (or dates) when 
the loss was temporarily booked in transitory or suspense accounts; 
 
(c)  the recoveries of gross loss amounts;  
 
(d)  descriptive information about the drivers or causes of the operational loss 
event, where the level of detail of any descriptive information must be 
commensurate with the size of the gross loss amounts. 
 
9.1.27 
Subject to paragraphs 9.1.20 and 9.1.21, a Relevant Reporting Bank must 
include operational loss events related to credit risk that are not accounted for in credit 
RWA in the internal loss data set. A Relevant Reporting Bank must not include any 
operational loss event related to credit risk that is accounted for in credit RWA in the 
internal loss data set. 
 
9.1.28 
Subject to paragraph 9.1.20 and 9.1.21, a Relevant Reporting Bank must 
include operational loss events related to market risk in the internal loss data set. 
 
 
 Specific criteria  
 
9.1.29 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must develop policies and procedures to identify 
gross loss amounts and the reference dates mentioned in paragraph 9.1.26(b), and to 
group losses that relate to a single operational loss event.  
 
9.1.30 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must be able to identify the gross loss amounts, 
non-insurance recoveries, and insurance recoveries for all operational loss events. For the 
purposes of calculating the net loss of an operational loss event pursuant to paragraph 
9.1.22, a Relevant Reporting Bank must use recoveries to reduce losses only after the 
Relevant Reporting Bank receives payment. A Relevant Reporting Bank must provide 
evidence of its receipt of such payments to the Authority upon request. 
 
9.1.31 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must include all of the following items in the 
computation of gross losses of an operational loss event: 
 
(a)  direct charges, including impairments and settlements, to the Relevant 
Reporting Bank’s P&L accounts and write-downs due to the operational 
loss event; 
 
(b)  costs incurred as a consequence of the operational loss event including 
external expenses with a direct link to the operational loss event915 and 
 
915  
For example, legal expenses directly related to the operational loss event and fees paid to advisors, 
attorneys or suppliers. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
9-10 
costs of repair or replacement, incurred to restore the position that was 
prevailing before the operational loss event916; 
 
(c)  reserves or provisions recognised in the Relevant Reporting Bank’s 
accounts against the potential loss impact arising from the operational loss 
event; 
 
(d)  losses stemming from the operational loss event with a definitive financial 
impact, which are temporarily booked in transitory or suspense accounts 
and are not yet reflected in the P&L (“pending losses”)917. A Relevant 
Reporting Bank must include pending losses in the internal loss data set 
within a time period commensurate with the size and age of the pending 
item;  
 
(e)  negative economic impacts booked in a financial year, due to the 
operational loss event impacting the cash flows or financial statements of 
previous financial years (“timing losses”)918. A Relevant Reporting Bank 
must include timing losses in the internal loss data set when they are due 
to an operational loss event that spans more than one financial year.  
 
9.1.32 
When a Relevant Reporting Bank makes a provision against a potential loss 
impact arising from an operational loss event, the Relevant Reporting Bank must include 
the provision amount as a gross loss in its internal loss data. When the Relevant Reporting 
Bank subsequently recognises a charge-off919, the Relevant Reporting Bank must add the 
difference between the initial provision and the charge-off (if any) to the gross loss 
calculation.920 
 
9.1.33 
When a Relevant Reporting Bank refunds a customer that was overbilled due to 
an operational failure –  
 
916  
For example, in the case where an asset of a Reporting Bank is damaged or destroyed, the costs incurred 
in relation to the reduction in the carrying amount of the asset and the costs of repair or replacement of 
the asset, without prejudice of additional indirect losses, are as follows: 
(a) where the asset is not replaced or repaired by the Reporting Bank, the reduction in the carrying amount 
of the asset, and any residual clean-up or disposal costs; 
(b) where the asset is replaced or fully repaired by the Reporting Bank, the cost of replacing or repairing 
the asset, and any residual clean-up or disposal costs; 
(c) where the asset is partially repaired by the Reporting Bank (i.e. the carrying amount of the asset is 
lower than prior to the operational loss event), the sum of the cost of repairing the asset, the reduction 
in the carrying amount of the asset after the repair, relative to the carrying amount of the asset prior 
to the operational loss event, and any residual clean-up or disposal costs.  
917  
For instance, the impact of some operational loss events (e.g. legal events, damage to physical assets) 
may be known and clearly identifiable before these operational loss events are first recognised as a reserve 
in the Relevant Reporting Bank’s accounts. Moreover, the way in which banks determine when to first 
recognise a reserve can vary across banks.  
918  
Timing impacts typically relate to the occurrence of operational risk loss that result in the temporary 
distortion of a Relevant Reporting Bank’s financial accounts (e.g. revenue overstatement, accounting errors 
and mark-to-market errors). While these operational loss events do not represent a true financial impact 
on the Relevant Reporting Bank (net impact over time is zero), if the error continues across more than one 
financial year, it may represent a material misrepresentation of the Relevant Reporting Bank’s financial 
statements.  
919  
For example, a settlement. 
920  
For example, if a Relevant Reporting Bank makes a S$1 million provision for a legal event in 2018 and then 
settles the legal event for S$1.2 million in 2019, the Relevant Reporting Bank’s gross loss is S$1 million in 
2018 and S$0.2 million in 2019 (that is, the S$1.2 million settlement in 2019 minus the S$1 million 
provision in 2018). 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
9-11 
 
(a)  if the refund is provided in the same financial year as the overbilling and 
no misrepresentation of the Relevant Reporting Bank’s financial 
statements occurs, the Relevant Reporting Bank must recognise no 
operational risk loss for the overbilling; and 
 
(b) 
if the refund is provided in a subsequent financial year to the overbilling, 
the Relevant Reporting Bank must include the timing loss as a gross loss 
in the financial year that the refund is provided, and must not recognise 
the overbilling as a recovery.  
 
9.1.34 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must exclude all of the following items from the 
computation of gross losses of an operational loss event: 
 
(a)  costs of general maintenance contracts on property, plant or equipment;  
 
(b)  expenditures to enhance the business after the operational risk losses921;  
 
(c)  insurance premiums. 
 
9.1.35 
For the purposes of paragraph 9.1.22, a Relevant Reporting Bank must allocate 
gross losses and recoveries arising from an operational loss event, including an operational 
loss event identified pursuant to paragraph 9.1.36, but posted to the accounts over several 
financial years, to the corresponding financial year in which the losses are recognised, in 
line with their accounting treatment. 
 
9.1.36 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must group all gross losses and recoveries caused 
by a common underlying trigger or root cause into one operational loss event in its internal 
loss data set.922 
 
9.1.37 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must have a clear, well-documented policy for 
determining the criteria for grouping multiple operational risk losses into an operational 
loss event (“loss event group policy”) and must have processes in place to ensure all of 
the following: 
 
(a)  there is a bank-wide understanding of the loss event group policy; 
 
(b)  there is appropriate sharing of internal loss data across businesses to 
implement the loss event group policy effectively; 
 
(c)  there are adequate controls, including the implementation of independent 
reviews, to assess ongoing compliance with the loss event group policy. 
 
 
921  
For example, upgrades, improvements, risk assessment initiatives and enhancements. 
922  
For example, a Relevant Reporting Bank must regard each of the following as one operational loss event in 
its internal loss data set:   
(a)  a natural disaster which causes operational risk losses in multiple locations or across an extended time 
period or both;  
(b)  a breach of a Relevant Reporting Bank’s information security which results in the disclosure of 
confidential customer information, and as a result, fraud-related losses incurred by multiple customers 
that the Relevant Reporting Bank must reimburse, and remediation expenses such as credit card 
re-issuances or credit history monitoring services.

Exclusion of losses from and inclusion of losses in the internal loss data set 
 
9.1.38 
A Relevant Reporting Bank may exclude operational loss events that are no 
longer relevant to the Relevant Reporting Bank’s risk profile from its internal loss data set, 
with immediate effect upon obtaining the written approval of the Authority, and subject to 
any conditions or restrictions that the Authority may impose. The Authority may consider 
granting such approval, if –  
 
(a)  the Relevant Reporting Bank rarely requests for the exclusion of 
operational loss events and the Relevant Reporting Bank’s request is 
supported by strong justification; 
 
(b)  the Relevant Reporting Bank demonstrates that it is unlikely for the cause 
of the operational loss event to occur in other areas of the Relevant 
Reporting Bank’s operations923;  
 
(c)  the Relevant Reporting Bank provides evidence, to the Authority’s 
satisfaction, that for the purposes of calculating the LC, the net loss arising 
from the operational loss event to be excluded is greater than 15% of the 
Relevant Reporting Bank’s average annual net losses over the past 10 
consecutive financial years or the observation period of the internal loss 
data as set out in paragraph 9.1.14 or 9.1.15, whichever is applicable, or 
such other higher percentage that the Authority may specify; and 
 
(d)  the Relevant Reporting Bank provides evidence, to the Authority’s 
satisfaction, that the operational loss event (except for losses related to 
divested businesses) to be excluded has been included in the Relevant 
Reporting Bank’s internal loss data set for a minimum period of one 
financial year, or such other longer minimum period that the Authority 
may specify.  
 
9.1.39 
Upon obtaining the Authority’s written approval in paragraph 9.1.38, a Relevant 
Reporting Bank must report the operational RWA taking into account such exclusion in the 
next quarterly submission of reporting schedules under Part XII.  
 
9.1.40 
Operational loss events relating to the reform of benchmark reference rates924 
do not fulfil the criteria for exclusion from a Relevant Reporting Bank’s loss data set 
pursuant to paragraph 9.1.38. To avoid doubt, not all costs related to the implementation 
of the reform of benchmark reference rates represent operational risk losses.925 
 
9.1.41 
A Relevant Reporting Bank must include every business acquired by the 
Relevant Reporting Bank and every entity merged with the Relevant Reporting Bank in its 
 
923  
For example, for settled legal exposures and divested businesses, the Relevant Reporting Bank must 
demonstrate that there are no similar or residual legal exposures and that the excluded operational loss 
event has no relevance to other activities or products, that the Relevant Reporting Bank continues to deal 
in. 
924  
For example, operational risk losses incurred over an extended period of time if a Relevant Reporting Bank 
fails to identify and remediate relevant legacy contracts prior to the discontinuation of a benchmark rate. 
925  
For example, legal fees incurred to amend contracts to prepare for the new reference rates in accordance 
with relevant legal rules, or costs related to adjustments to IT systems, would not represent operational 
risk losses. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

internal loss data set, with immediate effect after each respective acquisition or merger. 
The Relevant Reporting Bank must incorporate, in its internal loss data set, audited 
financial information (from before the acquisition or merger, as the case may be) of a 
business that is acquired or an entity that is merged, for the period relevant to the LC 
calculation. The Relevant Reporting Bank must report the operational RWA taking into 
account such inclusion in the next quarterly submission of reporting schedules under Part 
XII. Where a Relevant Reporting Bank does not have audited financial information (from 
before the acquisition or merger, as the case may be), of any business that is acquired or 
any entity that is merged, it must obtain the Authority’s written approval to use an 
alternative calculation methodology.

PART X: SUPERVISORY REVIEW PROCESS 
 
 
Division 1: Introduction 
 
10.1.1 
Part X sets out the key principles of the supervisory review process, risk 
management guidance, and supervisory transparency and accountability with respect to 
banking risks. It seeks to encourage a Reporting Bank to develop and use better risk 
management techniques in monitoring and managing its risks, and to ensure that a 
Reporting Bank has in place a rigorous process for determining the adequacy of its capital 
to support all risks to which it is exposed. This process is known as the ICAAP. A thorough 
and comprehensive ICAAP is a vital component of a strong risk management programme. 
A Reporting Bank must develop its own ICAAP and maintain capital levels that are 
commensurate with its risk profile and control environment. 
 
10.1.2 
The Authority will review a Reporting Bank’s ICAAP to evaluate how well the 
Reporting Bank is assessing its capital needs relative to its risks. The Authority may impose 
higher regulatory capital requirements on a Reporting Bank to buffer the Reporting Bank 
against the higher risk of unexpected losses resulting from inadequate controls or risk 
management process weaknesses. Despite any higher regulatory capital requirements, a 
Reporting Bank must address weaknesses in internal controls or risk management 
processes.929 Aside from requiring additional capital, the Authority may also apply other 
supervisory measures to address the heightened risk or risk management deficiencies of 
a Reporting Bank. The Authority may intervene at an early stage to prevent capital levels 
of a Reporting Bank from falling below the appropriate levels required to support the risk 
characteristics of the Reporting Bank, and to require swift remedial action from the 
Reporting Bank if the appropriate level of capital is not maintained or restored by the 
Reporting Bank. 
 
10.1.3 
A Reporting Bank must maintain an appropriate level of capital above minimum 
Pillar 1 requirements so that all risks of the Reporting Bank − both on- and off-balance 
sheet − are adequately covered, particularly those related to complex capital market 
activities930. 
 
 
 
 
 
929 
Higher regulatory capital requirements serve as an interim measure until permanent measures are 
implemented by a Reporting Bank to address such weaknesses. 
930 
This will help ensure that a Reporting Bank maintains sufficient capital for risks not adequately addressed 
through Pillar 1 and that it will be able to operate effectively throughout a severe and prolonged period of 
financial market stress or an adverse credit cycle. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-2 
Division 2: ICAAP 
 
 
Sub-division 1: General Requirements 
 
10.2.1 
A Reporting Bank is responsible for developing an ICAAP. A Reporting Bank 
must be able to demonstrate to the Authority that its ICAAP is comprehensive and that its 
chosen internal capital targets are well founded and consistent with its overall risk profile 
and operating environment, and that its capital levels are adequate in view of its overall 
risk profile and operating environment. 
 
10.2.2 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the outcome of the ICAAP is not a static 
capital target. A Reporting Bank must ensure the following: 
 
 
(a) 
the ICAAP takes into account the current stage of the business cycle of 
the Reporting Bank and is a forward-looking process capable of timely 
response to changes in the risk profile and business strategies of a 
Reporting Bank, as well as its external environment; 
 
(b) 
the ICAAP addresses both short- and long-term needs and considers the 
prudence of building excess capital over benign periods of the credit cycle 
and also to withstand a severe and prolonged market downturn; 
 
(c) 
the ICAAP incorporates rigorous stress testing and scenario analysis that 
identify possible events or changes in market conditions that could 
adversely impact the Reporting Bank; 
 
(d) 
the results of these stress tests and analyses are incorporated, where 
applicable, into the capital adequacy assessment of the Reporting Bank.  
 
 
10.2.3 
A Reporting Bank must implement its ICAAP in a methodical manner and ensure 
that the ICAAP is comprehensively documented in the policies, processes and procedures 
of a Reporting Bank. A Reporting Bank may vary the sophistication of its ICAAP according 
to the size, complexity, and business strategy of the Reporting Bank. At a minimum, a 
Reporting Bank must have the following features in its ICAAP: 
 
 
(a) 
Board and senior management oversight; 
 
(b) 
comprehensive assessment of risks; 
 
(c) 
sound capital assessment;  
 
(d) 
monitoring and reporting; 
 
(e) 
independent review. 
 
10.2.4 
A Reporting Bank must take into account the details set out in Annex 10A when 
assessing the comprehensiveness and rigour of its ICAAP. 
 
 
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-3 
Sub-division 2: Board and Senior Management Oversight 
 
10.2.5 
 A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and its senior management 
understand the nature and level of risks being taken by the Reporting Bank, and put in 
place appropriate risk management processes to mitigate the risks931. A Reporting Bank 
must maintain adequate capital beyond the regulatory minimum to support such risks and 
to take into account the following considerations: 
 
 
(a) 
level of creditworthiness of the Reporting Bank to be achieved in markets, 
that is higher than that indicated by the minimum regulatory capital 
requirements; 
 
(b) 
fluctuations in capital adequacy ratios, as a result of changes in type and 
volume of activities and risk exposures in the normal course of business; 
 
(c) 
cost of capital raising, especially in situations where capital injections need 
to be done quickly or at a time when market conditions are unfavourable; 
 
(d) 
potential breach of the minimum regulatory capital requirements and 
regulatory actions in such an event; 
 
(e) 
risks arising from the features of the countries or jurisdictions and markets 
in which the Reporting Bank operates. 
 
10.2.6 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and its senior management bear 
ultimate responsibility for ensuring a sound risk management framework, strong internal 
controls and a robust ICAAP, setting capital targets that are commensurate with the 
Reporting Bank’s risk profile and control environment, and ensuring that the Reporting 
Bank has adequate capital to support its risks beyond the regulatory requirements. In this 
regard, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board defines the Reporting Bank’s risk 
appetite, establishes an acceptable level of risks that the Reporting Bank may take, 
establishes the capital strategy of the Reporting Bank, and regularly verifies whether the 
Reporting Bank’s system of internal controls is adequate. A Reporting Bank must also 
ensure that its senior management – 
 
(a) 
performs an analysis of the current and future capital requirements of the 
Reporting Bank in relation to its strategic objectives; 
 
(b) 
establishes a strategic plan which clearly outlines the Reporting Bank’s 
capital needs, anticipated capital expenditures, desired capital levels, and 
external capital sources; 
 
(c) 
establishes frameworks for assessing the categories of risks facing the 
Reporting Bank and develops systems for relating these risks to the capital 
level of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(d) 
ensures that the Reporting Bank’s risk management framework includes 
detailed policies that set specific prudential limits which apply across the 
 
931  
A sound risk management framework is essential for the effective assessment of the adequacy of the capital 
position of a Reporting Bank. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-4 
banking group on the Reporting Bank’s activities, which are consistent 
with its risk taking appetite and capacity; 
 
(e) 
establishes a method for monitoring compliance with internal policies on 
risk assessment and the processes for relating risks to capital levels; 
 
(f) 
 institutes a strong internal control culture throughout the Reporting Bank, 
including the adoption of written policies and procedures; and 
 
(g) 
communicates the internal controls and written policies and procedures 
throughout the Reporting Bank. 
 
10.2.7 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board reviews and approves the target 
level and composition of capital, and the process for setting and monitoring such targets 
at least annually, to ensure congruence between the risk profile and capital adequacy of 
the Reporting Bank. 
 
10.2.8 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its senior management is responsible for 
developing a risk management framework and ensuring that the detail and sophistication 
of the risk management processes are appropriate in light of its risk profile, size, 
complexity and business strategy, and integrating the ICAAP with the capital planning and 
management processes of the Reporting Bank. 
 
10.2.9 
In this regard, a Reporting Bank must ensure that its senior management, at a 
minimum – 
 
 
(a) 
establishes robust policies and procedures to identify, measure and report 
all material risks; 
 
(b) 
evaluates the level and trend of material risks and their effect on capital 
levels; 
 
(c) 
evaluates the sensitivity and reasonableness of key assumptions used in 
the capital assessment and measurement system; 
 
(d) 
determines if the Reporting Bank holds sufficient capital against the risks 
facing the Reporting Bank; 
 
(e) 
assesses future capital needs based on the risk profile of the Reporting 
Bank and make necessary adjustments to its strategic plan; and 
 
(f) 
subjects the ICAAP to annual independent review for robustness and 
integrity. 
 
10.2.10 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that every subsidiary (including subsidiaries that 
are excluded from consolidation) of a Reporting Bank that is a financial institution 
regulated by the Authority or a financial services regulatory authority outside Singapore 
complies with the regulatory capital requirements imposed on that subsidiary by the 
Authority or the financial services regulatory authority of that subsidiary, and such 
subsidiary is adequately capitalised at all times. 
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-5 
Sub-division 3: Comprehensive Risk Assessment 
 
10.2.11 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its ICAAP identifies and assesses all material 
risks. In this respect, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the ICAAP addresses – 
 
 
(a) 
credit risk, market risk and operational risk, captured under Pillar 1; 
 
(b) 
risks not fully captured under Pillar 1932; 
 
(c) 
risks that are not taken into account by Pillar 1933; and 
 
(d) 
external factors outside the direct control of the Reporting Bank, including 
changes in regulations, accounting rules and the economic environment934. 
 
10.2.12 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its senior management puts in place risk 
management systems and processes that are robust and comprehensive, and be capable 
of capturing the nature and magnitude of all material risks faced by the Reporting Bank, 
not limited to credit, market, liquidity, operational, reputational, legal and strategic risks. 
A Reporting Bank must consider risks that do not appear to be significant in isolation, but 
when combined with other risks could lead to material losses. A Reporting Bank must 
identify the risks inherent in its business and determine how these risks should be 
incorporated into its ICAAP. 
 
10.2.13 
A Reporting Bank must fully document the risk assessment process and must 
be able to demonstrate to the Authority that all material aspects of risks have been 
considered and accounted for in its ICAAP. 
 
10.2.14 
A Reporting Bank must perform regular reviews of its ICAAP to ensure that all 
the risks identified continue to be relevant and accounted for, and that new risks are 
incorporated into the ICAAP on a timely basis. A Reporting Bank must also make 
adjustments to its ICAAP in light of changes in its operating profile or operating 
environment. 
 
10.2.15 
For each material risk identified in its ICAAP, a Reporting Bank must incorporate 
the following into its risk assessment and management process: 
 
 
(a) 
a Reporting Bank must conduct detailed analyses to determine the 
effectiveness and appropriateness of risk management techniques in 
controlling the risks identified; 
 
(b) 
a Reporting Bank must ensure that the risk assessments are consistent 
and objective; 
 
(c) 
a Reporting Bank must incorporate changes in its risk profile935 into its risk 
assessments on a timely basis; 
 
 
932 
For example, credit concentration risk. 
933 
For example, IRRBB, liquidity risk, business risk, reputational risk, strategic risk or concentration risk. 
934 
For example, business cycle effects. 
935 
These changes may result from the introduction of new products or activities, changes in business volumes, 
or changes in the operating environment. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-6 
(d)  a Reporting Bank must send to the Board and its senior management 
regular reports on the Reporting Bank’s risk profile and capital needs; 
 
(e) 
a Reporting Bank must not rely solely on quantitative methods to assess 
the risk, and must also use qualitative methods936 to assess and manage 
the risk; 
 
(f) 
a Reporting Bank must ensure the integrity of data used in its risk 
measurement process and such data is verifiable. 
 
 
Sub-division 4: Sound Capital Assessment 
 
10.2.16 
A Reporting Bank must state its objectives in deciding how much capital to hold. 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the capital objectives go beyond meeting the 
regulatory capital requirements set out in Part IV937. In particular, the Reporting Bank 
must explicitly state its expected future capital requirements and how it plans to meet 
those requirements (including under stressed situations). A Reporting Bank must ensure 
that the capital management process makes allowances for divergences and unexpected 
events. 
 
10.2.17 
A Reporting Bank must assess whether its long-run capital objectives differ 
significantly from its short-run capital objectives. As it may take time for a Reporting Bank 
to raise new capital, the Reporting Bank must make allowances for unexpected events, 
including putting in place contingency plans for raising additional capital. 
 
10.2.18 
A Reporting Bank must hold capital for uncertainties in the precision of risk 
measures and volatility of exposures. 
 
10.2.19 
A Reporting Bank must be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Authority that its approach of relating its capital to the risks it is exposed to is conceptually 
sound, and that the output and results of the ICAAP are reasonable, taking into account 
the Reporting Bank’s strategic focus and business plans. 
 
 
Sub-division 5: Independent Review 
 
10.2.20 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the systems for assessing the risks to which 
it is exposed and for relating those risks to the capital level of the Reporting Bank are 
reviewed independently by persons other than those responsible for the design or 
implementation of the ICAAP. A Reporting Bank must also ensure that its risk management 
processes and internal controls are frequently monitored and tested independently, to 
ensure that the information on which decisions are based is accurate so that processes 
fully reflect management policies and that regular reporting, including the reporting of 
limit breaches and other exception-based reporting, is undertaken effectively 938 . A 
 
936 
For example, qualitative methods are relevant for some material risks such as reputational risk and strategic 
risk, which cannot be easily quantified. 
937 
The capital objectives may include the desired level of risk coverage, credit rating or degree of 
creditworthiness (hence funding access) of the Reporting Bank. 
938 
A Reporting Bank should refer to the BCBS’ paper “Framework for Internal Control Systems in Banking 
Organisations” published in September 1998. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-7 
Reporting Bank must conduct a high level review939 at least annually. Arising from this 
high level review, the Reporting Bank must identify risks that must be reviewed for the 
current year and risks that can be deferred for review to the next 2 to 3 years. The 
Reporting Bank must document the outcome of each high level review, including full 
justifications for its priority of review. 
 
10.2.21 
A Reporting Bank must ensure the following: 
 
 
(a) 
the team responsible for the independent review is not in a position of 
conflict and does not stand to gain from particular review outcomes;  
 
(b) 
policies and processes are established to ensure that the independent 
review team is insulated from influence and pressure from others who 
stand to gain from particular review outcomes; 
 
(c) 
the independent review team possesses the necessary technical 
capabilities to perform the independent review in order to provide an 
effective 
challenge 
to 
persons 
responsible 
for 
the 
design 
and 
implementation of the ICAAP; 
 
(d) 
the results of the independent review are reported to the Board and senior 
management of the Reporting Bank. 
 
10.2.22 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the independent review covers the 
appropriateness of the capital assessment process, identification of large exposures and 
risk concentrations, the accuracy and completeness of data inputs, the reasonableness 
and validity of scenarios used, and stress testing and analysis of assumptions and inputs 
of the Reporting Bank. 
 
939 
A Reporting Bank should complete a full cycle for the independent review within a period of 3 years. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-8 
Division 3: Supervisory Review  
 
10.3.1 
The Authority will review and assess the following as part of its risk-based 
approach to supervision: 
 
 
(a) 
the ICAAP of a Reporting Bank; 
 
(b) 
compliance by a Reporting Bank with the requirements set out in this 
Notice; 
 
(c) 
the adequacy of capital maintained by a Reporting Bank. 
 
10.3.2 
The supervisory review of a Reporting Bank by the Authority includes the 
following areas: 
 
 (a) 
reviewing and evaluating a Reporting Bank’s ICAAP and strategies, as well 
as a Reporting Bank’s ability to monitor and ensure compliance with 
regulatory capital adequacy ratios; 
 
(b) 
assessing whether a Reporting Bank complies with the minimum 
standards, 
qualifying 
criteria 
and 
requirements, 
including 
risk 
management standards and disclosure requirements, set out in this Notice 
for the use of internal methodologies, CRM techniques and securitisations 
to be recognised for regulatory capital purposes, on an ongoing basis; 
 
(c) 
assessing whether a Reporting Bank complies with requirements and 
conditions set out in this Notice for the use of standardised approaches, 
and whether the use of various instruments that can reduce Pillar 1 capital 
requirements are utilised and understood as part of a sound, tested and 
properly documented risk management process; 
 
(d) 
assessing a Reporting Bank’s application of definition of default set out in 
Annex 7L and its impact on the adequacy of capital maintained by a 
Reporting Bank, focussing on the impact of deviations from the definition 
of default arising from the use of external data or internal data in 
accordance with paragraph 5.2(f), (g) and (h) of Annex 7X. 
 
10.3.3 
The Authority may place more reliance on the ICAAP results of a Reporting Bank 
if it has assessed the ICAAP to be robust and comprehensive. If the Authority is not 
satisfied with the outcomes from its review, the Authority may, among other things – 
 
 
(a) 
require the Reporting Bank to take action to improve its risk management 
processes or lower the risks which it assumes; 
 
(b) 
require the Reporting Bank to maintain additional capital; 
 
(c) 
restrict the payment of dividends by the Reporting Bank; 
 
(d) 
require the Reporting Bank to implement a satisfactory capital adequacy 
restoration plan, including plans to correct capital shortfalls in subsidiaries 
that are financial institutions regulated by the Authority or financial 
services regulatory authorities outside Singapore; and 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-9 
 
(e) 
apply other supervisory measures to address the heightened risk or risk 
management deficiencies of the Reporting Bank940. 
 
10.3.4 
The assessment process941 of the Authority generally involves a review of the 
documentation of the Reporting Bank on the ICAAP, discussions between the Authority 
and the key management personnel of the Reporting Bank, on-site examinations and other 
methods the Authority may identify as appropriate for evaluating the robustness of the 
ICAAP of a Reporting Bank942. 
 
10.3.5 
A Reporting Bank must furnish to the Authority such other information relating 
to the capital adequacy ratios and capitalisation level of the Reporting Bank, as may be 
requested by the Authority. 
 
 
 
 
 
940 
For example, intensifying supervisory monitoring of the Reporting Bank or requiring the Reporting Bank to 
apply internal limits, strengthen the level of its provisions and reserves, or improve its internal controls. 
941 
Following the assessment, a Reporting Bank should notify and engage the Authority in discussions if it plans 
to make material changes to its ICAAP. 
942 
This is intended to foster dialogue between the Reporting Bank and the Authority, so that when deficiencies 
are identified, prompt and decisive action may be taken by the Authority to reduce risk or restore capital.

Annex 10A 
 
SPECIFIC ISSUES IN ICAAP FOR MAIN RISK CATEGORIES AND TOPICS 
 
 
Section 1: Introduction 
 
1.1 
This Annex sets out additional details on the expectations of the Authority with 
regard to the ICAAP of a Reporting Bank. While this document is intended to help a 
Reporting Bank in assessing the comprehensiveness and rigour of its ICAAP, a Reporting 
Bank must not construe this document as an exhaustive compliance checklist943. The 
following material risk categories and topics are covered in this Annex: 
 
(a) 
Section 3 – Credit Risk, Concentration Risk, Counterparty Credit Risk and 
Securitisation Risk; 
 
(b) 
Section 4 – Market Risk and Valuation Practices; 
 
(c) 
Section 5 – Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book; 
 
(d) 
Section 6 – Operational Risk; 
 
(e) 
Section 7 – Liquidity Risk;  
 
(f) 
Section 8 – Reputational Risk; 
 
(g) 
Section 9 – Other Risk Categories; 
 
(h) 
Section 10 – Stress Testing Practices. 
 
 
Section 2: General  
 
2.1 
In addition to the specific issues covered in the respective sections, a Reporting 
Bank must observe the following: 
 
(a)  a Reporting Bank must have a comprehensive risk management 
framework for each main risk category that the Reporting Bank identifies 
in its ICAAP. A Reporting Bank must ensure that its risk management 
framework for each risk category sets out clearly the policies and 
procedures of the Reporting Bank for the identification, assessment, 
monitoring and control or mitigation of each material risk, and be 
adequately documented. A Reporting Bank must set specific prudential 
limits that apply across the banking group on material risks relevant to 
the Reporting Bank’s activities, which are consistent with its risk taking 
 
943 
A Reporting Bank should refer to “A Sound Capital Planning Process: Fundamental Elements” and “Overview 
of Pillar 2 supervisory review practices and approaches” issued by the BCBS in January 2014 and June 
2019, respectively. A Reporting Bank should also refer to other relevant risk management publications 
issued by the BCBS and the Authority. For example, the “Guidelines on Risk Management Practices” issued 
by the Authority, “Range of Practices and Issues in Economic Capital Frameworks” issued by the BCBS in 
March 2009, and “Supervisory guidance for managing risks associated with the settlement of foreign 
exchange transactions” issued by the BCBS in February 2013. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

appetite and capacity. The Reporting Bank must define the limits in 
relation to its capital, total assets, earnings or, where adequate measures 
exist, its overall risk level 944. The Reporting Bank must implement a 
process to review and update such policies, procedures and limits as 
appropriate; 
 
(b) 
with respect to new or complex products and activities, a Reporting Bank 
must ensure that senior management understands the underlying 
assumptions regarding business models, valuation and risk management 
practices and evaluate the potential risk exposure if those assumptions 
fail; 
 
 
(c) 
before a Reporting Bank launches any new product or undertakes any new 
activity, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and senior 
management identify and review the changes in risks across the banking 
group arising from the new product or activity and ensure that the 
infrastructure and internal controls necessary to manage the related risks 
are in place. In the review, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board 
and senior management must also consider the possible difficulty in 
valuing the new product and how it might perform in a stressed economic 
environment; 
 
 (d) a Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and senior management 
have a sufficient understanding of each risk category and risk exposures 
across the banking group, and that senior management possesses in-
depth knowledge of these risk categories and is responsible for the 
effective implementation of the risk management framework, including its 
approval and regular review. A Reporting Bank must also ensure that the 
Board and senior management have the necessary expertise to 
understand the capital markets activities in which the Reporting Bank is 
involved in, including securitisation and off-balance sheet activities, and 
the associated risks; 
 
(e) 
a Reporting Bank must set out the responsibilities of senior management, 
business line managers and functional units managing the material risk, 
including clearly defined risk limits and reporting thresholds, in each risk 
management framework. A Reporting Bank must clearly delineate the 
accountability and lines of authority. A Reporting Bank must ensure that 
its risk function and its chief risk officer or equivalent position is 
independent of the individual business lines and reports directly to the 
chief executive officer and the Board; 
 
(f) 
a Reporting Bank must ensure regular monitoring of risk exposures and 
regular reporting of significant risk concerns to the Board. A Reporting 
Bank must have in place procedures for reporting deviations from 
established policies to the Board or senior management, as appropriate; 
 
(g) 
a Reporting Bank must subject each risk management framework to 
regular independent reviews. 
 
 
944 
The Reporting Bank should also take into consideration its role in the financial system in defining the limits. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

2.2 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that appropriate members of senior 
management bring together the perspectives of the key business and control functions to 
achieve an understanding of risk exposures and develop an integrated perspective on risk 
across the banking group. A Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management 
overcome organisational silos between business lines and share information on market 
developments, risks and risk mitigation techniques. 
 
2.3 
To enable proactive management of risk, a Reporting Bank must have 
appropriate management information systems at the business level and across the banking 
group. A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and senior management are 
responsible for implementing management information systems that are capable of 
providing regular, accurate and timely information on the Reporting Bank’s aggregate risk 
profile, as well as the main assumptions used for risk aggregation. The Reporting Bank 
must ensure that the management information systems are adaptable and responsive to 
changes in the Reporting Bank’s underlying risk assumptions and incorporate multiple 
perspectives of risk exposure to account for uncertainties in risk measurement. A 
Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management understands the assumptions 
behind and limitations inherent in each risk measure. The Reporting Bank must ensure 
that the relevant information concerning the Reporting Bank’s risk profile includes all risk 
exposures (including those that are off-balance sheet). The Reporting Bank must subject 
third-party inputs or other tools used within the management information systems, 
including credit ratings, risk measures and models, to initial and ongoing validation. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the management information systems are sufficiently 
flexible to – 
 
(a) 
allow for aggregation of exposures and risk measures across business lines; 
 
(b) 
support customised identification of concentrations and emerging risks; 
 
(c) 
support forward-looking scenario analyses across the banking group that 
capture management’s interpretation of evolving market conditions and 
stressed conditions; and 
 
(d) 
capture limit breaches945. 
 
2.4 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and senior management are 
responsible for mitigating the risks arising from remuneration policies in order to ensure 
effective risk management across the banking group. For a broad and deep risk 
management culture to develop and be maintained over time, the Reporting Bank must 
ensure that compensation practices and policies are not unduly linked to short-term 
accounting profit generation. The Reporting Bank must ensure that compensation policies 
are linked to longer-term capital preservation and the financial strength of the Reporting 
Bank and must consider risk-adjusted performance measures946. 
 
 
 
945 
For example, a Reporting Bank should aggregate similar exposures across business platforms (including 
both the banking book and the trading book) to determine whether there is a concentration or a breach of 
an internal position limit. 
946 
For further guidance, a Reporting Bank should refer to relevant publications issued by the BCBS and the 
Authority, for example, “Principles for Sound Compensation Practices” published by the Financial Stability 
Board in April 2009, “The Compensation Principles and Standards Assessment Methodology” published by 
the BCBS in January 2010, and “Corporate Governance Principles for Banks” published by the BCBS in 2015.

Section 3: Credit Risk, Concentration Risk, Counterparty Credit Risk and 
Securitisation Risk  
 
 
Introduction 
 
3.1 
A Reporting Bank must, at a minimum, cover the following areas in its credit 
risk assessment for the purposes of capital adequacy:  
 
 (a) 
risk rating systems; 
 
(b) 
portfolio analysis and aggregation;  
 
(c) 
large exposures and risk concentrations;  
 
(d) 
country or jurisdiction risk, and transfer risk; 
 
(e) 
securitisation and complex credit derivatives. 
 
 
3.2 
A Reporting Bank must have internal credit risk rating systems capable of 
assessing credit risk exposures both on an individual obligor basis, as well as systems in 
place to analyse credit risk on a portfolio level. A Reporting Bank must ensure that internal 
risk ratings are able to identify and measure risk from all credit exposures, and are 
integrated into the overall analysis of credit risk and capital adequacy of the Reporting 
Bank. A Reporting Bank must ensure that the credit review process is comprehensive and, 
at a minimum, has the ability to – 
 
(a) 
generate detailed ratings for all credit exposures;  
 
(b) 
determine an adequate level of loan loss reserves; 
 
(c) 
identify credit weaknesses at the portfolio level, especially large exposures 
and credit risk concentrations; and  
 
(d) 
consider the risks involved in securitisation and complex credit derivative 
transactions. 
 
3.3 
A Reporting Bank using the SA(CR) must assess exposures, regardless of 
whether they are rated or unrated, and determine whether the risk weights applied to 
such exposures under the SA(CR) are appropriate for their inherent risk. In those instances 
where it determines that the inherent risk of such an exposure, particularly if it is unrated, 
is significantly higher than that implied by the risk weight to which it is assigned, the 
Reporting Bank must consider the higher degree of credit risk in the evaluation of its 
overall capital adequacy.  
 
 
 
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-14 
 
Concentration Risk (including credit concentration risk)947  
 
3.4 
A risk concentration948 is a single exposure or group of 2 or more exposures of 
similar risk characteristics949 with the potential to produce –  
 
(a)  losses large enough (relative to a Reporting Bank’s earnings, capital, total 
assets 
or 
overall 
risk 
level) 
to 
threaten 
a 
Reporting 
Bank’s 
creditworthiness or ability to maintain its core operations; or  
 
(b)  a material change in a Reporting Bank’s risk profile. 
 
3.5 
A Reporting Bank must aggregate direct and indirect exposures with common 
or correlated950 risks, across its different business lines, regardless of where the exposures 
have been booked.951 A Reporting Bank must analyse risk concentrations at both the Solo 
and Group levels, and at the level of each banking group entity.952,953  
 
3.6 
While concentration risk often arises due to direct exposures to obligors, a 
Reporting Bank must identify and manage risk concentrations to a particular asset type 
indirectly through investments backed by specific asset types954 or exposures to protection 
providers guaranteeing the performance of specific asset types955. 
 
3.7 
Through its risk management processes and management information systems, 
a Reporting Bank must identify and aggregate exposures with common or correlated risks 
across the banking group 956, including across legal entities, asset types 957, and risk 
areas958, and for the following: 
 
(a) 
significant credit exposures to a single counterparty or a group of 2 or 
more related counterparties; 
 
(b) 
credit exposures to counterparties in the same economic sector, industry, 
or geographic region;  
 
 
947 
A Reporting Bank should ensure that it complies with the “Principles for the Management of Credit Risk” 
issued by the BCBS in September 2000. A Reporting Bank should also refer to any other relevant 
publications issued by the BCBS and the Authority in this area. 
948 
Risk concentrations can arise from the assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet items of a Reporting Bank, 
through the execution or processing of transactions (either product or service), or through a combination 
of exposures across these broad categories. 
949 
Examples of exposures with similar characteristics are exposures to the same counterparty (including 
protection providers), geographic area, industry or other risk factors. 
950 
For example, correlations between market, credit and liquidity risks. 
951 
Risk concentrations, by their nature, are dependent on common or correlated vulnerabilities, which if 
realised, can have an adverse impact on individual exposures making up the concentration. 
952 
A risk concentration may appear immaterial at the Group level, but can nonetheless threaten the viability 
of a banking group entity. 
953 
A Reporting Bank should employ a number of techniques, as appropriate, to measure these concentrations. 
The techniques include shocks to various risk factors, use of scenarios at the business level and across the 
banking group, use of integrated stress testing and economic capital models. 
954 
For example, collateralised debt obligations. 
955 
For example, monoline insurers. 
956 
A Reporting Bank should be cognisant that the growth of market-based intermediation has increased the 
possibility that different areas of a Reporting Bank are exposed to a common set of products, risk factors 
or counterparties. 
957 
For example, loans, derivatives, structured products or off-balance sheet exposures. 
958 
For example, exposures in the banking book and trading book. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-15 
(c) 
credit exposures to counterparties whose financial performance is 
dependent on the same activity or commodity or other common risks; 
 
(d) 
indirect credit exposures arising from investment and CRM activities of a 
Reporting Bank959. 
 
3.8 
For its concentration risk management programme, a Reporting Bank must, 
amongst other things – 
 
(a) 
ensure that the senior management of a Reporting Bank is responsible for 
developing policies and procedures for identifying, measuring, monitoring 
and controlling concentration risk in a timely manner. The Reporting Bank 
must ensure that such policies and procedures are implemented at both 
the Solo and Group levels, and are commensurate with the overall risk 
appetite and strategic initiatives of the Reporting Bank. The Reporting 
Bank must clearly assign responsibilities for the measurement and 
monitoring of risks and risk concentrations to a person or unit that is 
independent of any person or unit originating such risk exposures. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the risk management framework for 
concentration risk is clearly documented; 
 
(b) 
ensure that the Board reviews and approves the risk management 
framework for concentration risk proposed by the management of the 
Reporting Bank. The Reporting Bank must regularly apprise the Board of 
the risk exposure and vulnerability of the Reporting Bank to risk 
concentrations, and ensure that adequate resources are devoted to 
effectively manage risk concentrations; 
 
(c) 
clearly define risk concentrations relevant to the Reporting Bank, along 
with how these concentrations and their corresponding limits are to be 
measured. A Reporting Bank must also have in place comprehensive 
management information and reporting systems to facilitate the 
identification and monitoring of risk concentrations across portfolios; 
 
(d) 
have credible risk mitigation strategies in place that have senior 
management approval.960 A Reporting Bank must have in place adequate 
and systematic procedures for identifying high correlation between the 
creditworthiness of a protection provider and the obligors of the underlying 
exposures due to their performance being dependent on common factors 
beyond systematic risk; 
 
(e) 
establish internal limits that are reasonable in relation to its capital, total 
assets or, where adequate measures exist, its overall risk level. A 
Reporting Bank must not set its internal limits based solely on regulatory 
capital requirements without regard for its own risk appetite;  
 
 
959 
For example, exposures to similar asset or collateral types or to credit protection provided by a single 
counterparty of a group of related counterparties. 
960 
For example, altering business strategies, reducing limits or increasing capital buffers in line with the 
Reporting Bank’s desired risk profile. While a Reporting Bank implements risk mitigation strategies, it should 
be aware of possible concentrations that might arise as a result of employing risk mitigation techniques. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-16 
(f) 
give attention to qualitative factors in the assessment of risk 
concentrations. This includes analysing how political, legal, regulatory, 
societal and market conditions might impact the obligors of a Reporting 
Bank and the industries and countries in which the Reporting Bank 
operates; 
 
(g) 
perform periodic scenario analysis and stress testing of material risk 
concentrations and analyse the results, to identify potential changes in 
key factors that could affect the Reporting Bank’s risk concentrations, 
including economic cycles, interest rate movements, liquidity and market 
conditions, and to assess its ability to withstand such changes. 961 In 
addition, the Reporting Bank must ensure that scenarios consider possible 
concentrations arising from contractual and non-contractual contingent 
claims; and  
 
(h) 
put in place adequate internal controls in the concentration risk 
management framework, including an independent review, to ensure the 
integrity of the information used by the Board and senior management. 
 
3.9 
A Reporting Bank must consider the extent of its risk concentrations in its 
assessment of capital adequacy and, where appropriate, set aside additional capital to 
address such risk962. 
 
 
Residual Credit Risk Arising From CRM963 
 
3.10 
A Reporting Bank must have in place an effective framework to manage residual 
risks from the use of CRM, including appropriate written CRM policies and procedures to 
manage and control residual risks.964 A Reporting Bank must submit these policies and 
procedures to the Authority, where required by the Authority, and must regularly review 
the appropriateness, effectiveness and operation of the policies and procedures. A 
Reporting Bank must, amongst other things, do the following to ensure that the framework 
is effective: 
 
(a) 
a Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and senior management are 
aware of and understand the CRM used by the Reporting Bank. A 
Reporting Bank must clearly assign the responsibility for the management 
and monitoring of CRM to a person, unit or department within the 
 
961 
Stress testing can also help to identify concentrations in the portfolios or different exposures of a Reporting 
Bank as seemingly uncorrelated exposures during normal market conditions may become correlated under 
stressed conditions. Examples of stress scenarios that may have an impact on the performance and 
exposure of a Reporting Bank include a recession, a pandemic, an oil price hike or a natural disaster. 
962 
Although risk concentrations are mitigated to some extent by the imposition of internal limits or supervisory 
limits, such risk is not explicitly taken into account under the Pillar 1 regulatory capital requirements. 
963 
For further guidance, a Reporting Bank should refer to Newsletter No. 16 on “High Cost Credit Protection” 
issued by the BCBS in December 2011, and any other relevant publications issued by the BCBS and the 
Authority in this area. 
964 
CRM, such as collateral, guarantees and credit derivatives, can reduce Pillar 1 regulatory capital 
requirements for Reporting Banks. However, such techniques can give rise to other risks including legal, 
documentation, operational, liquidity and market risks (collectively known as “residual risk”) that may 
reduce the effectiveness of CRM. Examples of such residual risk include the inability to realise in a timely 
manner the collateral pledged, the refusal or delay by a guarantor to pay and the legal enforceability of 
contracts. While a Reporting Bank may meet the regulatory capital requirements under Pillar 1, such 
residual risks could result in the Reporting Bank having a greater than expected credit risk exposure to an 
underlying counterparty. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-17 
Reporting Bank. A Reporting Bank must ensure that procedures and 
controls to implement such policies are approved by senior management, 
who possess adequate product knowledge for proper management of all 
material risks965 associated with credit derivatives; 
 
(b) 
a Reporting Bank must have sound written policies and procedures 
covering strategy, consideration of the underlying credit, valuation, 
systems and management of concentration risk arising from the use of 
CRM and its interaction with the overall credit risk profile of the Reporting 
Bank. A Reporting Bank must ensure that such policies and procedures 
clearly specify the acceptable types of CRM, the purposes for which such 
transactions are to be undertaken, as well as lending policies966; 
 
(c) 
a Reporting Bank must ensure that sound policies and procedures are 
accompanied by effective internal controls for the management of CRM 
activities. A Reporting Bank must conduct sufficient legal review, including 
obtaining a written independent legal opinion967, to satisfy itself that the 
documentation used in CRM for an exposure are binding on all parties and 
legally enforceable in all relevant countries or jurisdictions. A Reporting 
Bank must regularly monitor CRM activities and report significant concerns 
to the Board and senior management; 
 
(d) 
when calculating capital requirements, a Reporting Bank must consider 
whether it is appropriate to recognise the full value of the credit risk 
mitigant as permitted under Pillar 1. A Reporting Bank must ensure that 
its CRM management policies and procedures are appropriate to the level 
of capital benefit it recognises; 
 
(e) 
a Reporting Bank must implement regular independent reviews of its risk 
management process for CRM in accordance with paragraph 10.2.20. This 
helps to ensure that policies and procedures are adhered to as well as 
facilitate the timely identification of internal control weaknesses or system 
deficiencies. This also helps to ensure compliance with the minimum 
operational requirements for CRM set out in Part VII. 
 
3.11 
A Reporting Bank must evaluate its capital adequacy taking into account the 
residual risks arising from CRM and, where appropriate, set aside additional capital to 
address such risk. 
 
 
Counterparty Credit Risk (“CCR”) 
 
3.12 
A Reporting Bank must employ sound practices in managing all aspects of its 
CCR exposures, regardless of the methods used to compute its regulatory capital 
requirements under Pillar 1. As CCR represents a form of credit risk, a Reporting Bank 
 
965 
Examples of material risks are credit, market, counterparty, legal and liquidty risks. 
966 
An example of such lending policies is advance rates. 
967 
While a Reporting Bank may use either an in-house or external legal counsel for the purposes of obtaining 
a written independent legal opinion, it should consider whether or not an in-house counsel opinion is 
appropriate. In the case of an in-house legal opinion, a Reporting Bank should ensure that the in-house 
legal counsel providing the legal opinion should be independent of the parties involved in the origination of 
the exposure or the use of CRM for the exposure. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-18 
must observe, in relation to its CCR exposures, the requirements on stress testing, credit 
concentrations and residual risks associated with CRM set out in this Notice. 
 
3.13 
A Reporting Bank must have in place CCR management policies, processes and 
systems that are conceptually sound and implemented with integrity relative to the 
sophistication and complexity of its CCR exposures. In order to have sound CCR policies, 
processes and systems, a Reporting Bank must, amongst other things – 
 
(a) 
ensure that the Board and senior management are actively involved in the 
CCR control processes of the Reporting Bank and that sufficient resources 
are devoted to the CCR control function. Where the Reporting Bank is 
using an internal model for CCR, a Reporting Bank must ensure that senior 
management is aware of the limitations and assumptions of the model 
used and the impact these can have on the reliability of the output, and 
also considers the uncertainties of the market environment 968  and 
operational issues 969  and how these are reflected in the model. A 
Reporting Bank must ensure that daily reports prepared on the CCR 
exposures are reviewed by a level of management with sufficient seniority 
and authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual 
credit managers or traders and reductions in the overall CCR exposure of 
the Reporting Bank;  
 
(b) 
establish sound and well-documented CCR management policies and 
procedures for identifying, measuring, approving, managing, monitoring 
and internal reporting of CCR exposures970; 
 
(c) 
ensure that its CCR management policies take account of the market, 
liquidity, legal and operational risks that can be associated with CCR and, 
to the extent practicable, inter-relationships among those risks. Before 
undertaking business with a counterparty, a Reporting Bank must assess 
the creditworthiness of the counterparty and take due account of both 
settlement and pre-settlement credit risk. A Reporting Bank must 
aggregate all credit exposures to each counterparty and manage these at 
both the Solo and Group levels; 
 
(d) 
ensure that the CCR management system of a Reporting Bank is used in 
conjunction with internal credit and trading limits. A Reporting Bank must 
relate credit and trading limits to the risk measurement model of the 
Reporting Bank, in a manner consistent over time and that is well 
understood by credit managers, traders and senior management; 
 
(e) 
ensure that the measurement of CCR includes the monitoring of daily and 
intra-day usage of credit lines. A Reporting Bank must measure current 
exposure gross and net of collateral held. A Reporting Bank must include 
the measurement and monitoring of peak exposure or potential future 
exposure at a confidence level chosen by the Reporting Bank at both the 
portfolio and counterparty levels in its limit monitoring system. A 
 
968 
For example, timing of realisation of collateral. 
969 
For example, pricing feed irregularities. 
970 
For example, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the CCR management manual of the Reporting Bank sets 
out the basic principles of the risk management system as well as provides an explanation of the empirical 
techniques used to measure CCR. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-19 
Reporting Bank must take into account large or concentrated positions, 
including concentrations by groups of related counterparties, industry, 
market and customer investment strategies; 
 
(f) 
monitor the appropriate risks and have processes to adjust its estimation 
of EPE when those risks become significant, in the case where a Reporting 
Bank has received approval from the Authority to use an internal model 
to estimate its exposure amount or EAD for CCR exposures. This includes 
the following: 
 
(i) 
a Reporting Bank must identify and manage its exposures to specific 
wrong-way risk; 
 
(ii) 
for exposures with a rising risk profile after one year, a Reporting 
Bank must compare on a regular basis the estimate of EPE over one 
year with the EPE over the life of the exposure; 
 
(iii) for exposures with maturities below one year, a Reporting Bank must 
compare on a regular basis the replacement cost (current exposure) 
and the realised exposure profile, or store such data that would allow 
comparisons; 
 
(g) 
have in place a routine and rigorous programme of stress testing as a 
supplement to the CCR analysis based on the day-to-day output of the 
risk measurement model of the Reporting Bank. A Reporting Bank must 
ensure that stress-testing results are reviewed periodically by senior 
management and taken into account when setting the CCR policies and 
limits. Where stress tests reveal particular vulnerability to a given set of 
circumstances, a Reporting Bank must explicitly consider appropriate risk 
management strategies971; 
 
(h) 
have procedures in place for ensuring compliance with a documented set 
of internal policies, procedures and controls concerning the operation of 
the CCR management system; and 
 
(i) 
conduct an independent review through its internal auditing process in 
accordance with Sub-division 5 of Part X of its CCR management system 
and process at regular intervals.972 A Reporting Bank must include both 
the activities of the business credit and trading units and of the 
independent CCR control unit in the independent review. A Reporting Bank 
must ensure that, at a minimum, the review specifically addresses – 
 
(i) 
the adequacy of the documentation of the CCR management system 
and process; 
 
(ii) 
the organisation of the CCR control unit; 
 
(iii) the integration of CCR measures into daily risk management; 
 
 
971 
For example, hedging against that outcome or reducing the size of the exposures. 
972 
The review should ideally be conducted not less than once a year. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-20 
(iv) the approval process for risk pricing models and valuation systems 
used by front and back-office personnel; 
 
(v) 
the validation of any significant change in the CCR measurement 
process; 
 
(vi) the scope of CCR captured by the risk measurement model; 
 
(vii) the integrity of the management information system; 
 
(viii) the accuracy and completeness of CCR data; 
 
(ix) the verification of the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data 
sources used to run internal models, including the independence of 
such data sources; 
 
(x) 
the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation 
assumptions; 
 
(xi) the accuracy of valuation and risk transformation calculations; 
 
(xii) the verification of the accuracy of the model through frequent 
backtesting; 
 
(xiii) the organisation of the collateral management unit; and 
 
(xiv) the accurate reflection of legal terms in collateral and netting 
agreements into exposure measurements. 
 
3.14 
A Reporting Bank must consider the extent of its CCR in its assessment of 
capital adequacy and, where appropriate, set aside additional capital to address such risk. 
 
 
Securitisation 
 
3.15 
A Reporting Bank must implement an effective framework to manage risks from 
securitisation which includes the following elements: 
 
(a) 
a Reporting Bank must assign clearly responsibility for the management 
and monitoring of securitisations. A Reporting Bank must ensure that the 
Board and senior management are aware of and understands the effect of 
securitisation on its risk profile as well as the legal, accounting, risk-based 
capital and potential reputational impact of this activity. A Reporting Bank 
must ensure that senior management is responsible for the participation 
of the Reporting Bank in securitisations and provides direction on the 
strategy of the Reporting Bank for securitisation as well as its development 
of policies and procedures for managing, monitoring and controlling risks 
arising from securitisation activities; 
 
(b) 
a Reporting Bank must understand the credit quality and risk 
characteristics of the underlying exposures and have securitisation policies 
and procedures in place to ensure that prudent standards of credit 
assessment and approval relevant to its role in a securitisation are 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-21 
adhered to. A Reporting Bank must conduct analyses of the underlying 
risks when investing in securitisations and must not solely rely on the 
external credit ratings assigned to securitisation exposures by credit rating 
agencies. A Reporting Bank must conduct credit analysis of a securitisation 
exposure at acquisition and on an ongoing basis973. A Reporting Bank must 
review the maturity of the exposures underlying the securitisation against 
the maturity of the securities issued pursuant to the securitisation in order 
to assess potential maturity mismatches. A Reporting Bank providing 
credit enhancement must assess the risk thereof on an arm’s length basis 
in accordance with its normal credit assessment and approval processes; 
 
(c) 
a Reporting Bank with securitisation exposures must take into account the 
credit risk arising from the underlying exposures in determining its overall 
exposures to any particular obligor, industry or geographic area for the 
purpose of managing concentration risks. A Reporting Bank must track 
credit risk in securitisation exposures at the transaction level, and 
aggregate credit risk exposures across securitisation exposures within 
each business line and across business lines. A Reporting Bank must also 
track concentrations in its securitisation exposures, including name, 
product and sector concentrations, across the banking group in its 
management information systems; 
 
(d) 
a Reporting Bank undertaking a role in a securitisation must satisfy itself 
that it is not subject to reputational risk, and where appropriate, disclose 
its obligations in order to mitigate that risk; 
 
(e) 
a Reporting Bank must have in place appropriate internal systems and 
controls to identify, monitor and manage the risks that arise from its 
involvement in securitisations. These risks include credit, market, liquidity 
and reputational risks of each exposure, potential delinquencies and losses 
on the underlying securitised exposures, exposures from credit lines or 
liquidity facilities to special purpose entities, and exposures from 
guarantees provided by monolines and other third parties. A Reporting 
Bank must ensure that its securitisation exposures are monitored on an 
ongoing basis and that significant concerns are reported to the Board and 
senior management on a timely basis. A Reporting Bank must include its 
securitisation exposures in its management information system to ensure 
that senior management understands the implications of such exposures 
for the Reporting Bank’s liquidity, earnings, risk concentration and capital. 
A Reporting Bank must have the necessary processes in place to capture, 
in a timely manner, updated information on its securitisation transactions, 
including market data, if available, and updated performance data from 
the servicer of the securitisation and trustee representing investors of a 
securitisation; 
 
(f) 
a Reporting Bank must assess the adequacy of the regulatory capital 
requirements stated in Part VII and all relevant and prevailing legislation 
and Notices as may be in force from time to time, for its securitisation 
 
973 
A Reporting Bank should have in place the necessary quantitative tools, valuation models and stress tests 
of sufficient sophistication to reliably assess all relevant risks, including any risk concentrations and 
correlation between underlying exposures.

exposures, whether retained or repurchased, taking into account the 
economic substance of those securitisation exposures; 
 
(g) 
a Reporting Bank that employs risk mitigation techniques for a 
securitisation must understand the risks to be mitigated, the potential 
effects of that risk mitigation and whether or not the risk mitigation is 
effective974. The Reporting Bank must take account of the appropriateness 
of credit protection recognised against first loss credit enhancements or 
purchased on first loss retained securitisation positions in determining its 
economic capital; 
 
(h) 
a Reporting Bank must understand the structure of the securitisation and 
must identify the various types of triggers975, credit events and other legal 
provisions that may affect the performance of its on- and off-balance sheet 
exposures. A Reporting Bank must integrate these triggers and provisions 
into its funding, liquidity, credit and balance sheet management and 
consider the impact on its liquidity and capital positions. A Reporting Bank 
must consider the effects that changes in portfolio management or 
business strategies may have on the levels of excess spread and on the 
likelihood of an early amortisation event976; 
 
(i) 
a Reporting Bank must have in place reasonable methods for allocating 
economic capital against the economic substance of the credit risk arising 
from revolving securitisations and use techniques977 to understand pool 
performance. The Reporting Bank must have in place capital and liquidity 
contingency plans to evaluate the probability of an early amortisation 
occurring and to address the implications of scheduled and early 
amortisations of revolving securitisations as well as adverse and 
unanticipated changes and market disruptions. The Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the sophistication of its system in monitoring the probability 
and risks of an early amortisation event is commensurate with the size 
and complexity of its securitisation activities that involve early 
amortisation provisions. The Reporting Bank must also develop 
contingency plans to address how the Reporting Bank would respond to 
funding, capital and other pressures that arise when its access to 
securitisation markets is reduced and address valuation challenges for 
potentially illiquid positions held for sale or for trading; 
 
 
974 
This is to ensure that the Reporting Bank does not understate the true risk of securitisation exposures. 
975 
For example, a Reporting Bank should consider the following factors affecting excess spread levels: 
(a) interest payments made by obligors on the underlying receivable balances; 
(b) other fees and charges to be paid by the underlying obligors (e.g. late-payment fees, cash advance 
fees, over-limit fees); 
(c) gross write-offs; 
(d) principal payments; 
(e) recoveries on loans written off; 
(f) interchange fees; 
(g) interest paid on securitisation exposures held by investors; 
(h) macroeconomic factors such as bankruptcy rates, interest rate movements and unemployment rates. 
976 
For example, marketing strategies or underwriting changes that result in lower finance charges or higher 
charge-offs, may lower excess spread levels and increase the likelihood of an early amortisation event. 
977 
For example, static pool cash collections analyses and stress tests. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-23 
(j) 
a Reporting Bank must not make use of clauses within the documentation 
of the securitisation that entitle the Reporting Bank to call the 
securitisation transaction or terminate the coverage of credit protection 
prematurely where the Reporting Bank’s exposure to losses or 
deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures would be 
increased978. Where a Reporting Bank sets a date for the exercise of a call 
on the securitisation transaction, the Reporting Bank must set the date to 
be no earlier than the duration or the weighted average life of the 
underlying securitisation exposures from the commencement of the 
securitisation transaction; 
 
(k) 
a Reporting Bank must conduct a proper review, taking into consideration 
the rationale for the decision of the Reporting Bank to exercise a call and 
the impact of the call on the CET1 CAR, Tier 1 CAR and Total CAR of the 
Reporting Bank, prior to exercising a call; 
 
(l) 
a Reporting Bank must subject the risk management process of the 
Reporting Bank for securitisation to regular independent review. 
 
3.16 
Where the Authority is not satisfied that the credit risk transfer arising from a 
securitisation is sufficient or existent, or that the risks arising from the securitisation are 
adequately addressed in the minimum capital requirement, or that the Reporting Bank’s 
contingency plans referred to in paragraph 3.15(i) of this Annex are adequate, action taken 
by the Authority may include requiring a Reporting Bank to maintain capital additional to 
that required under Pillar 1979, disallowing the Reporting Bank from gaining capital relief 
on securitised assets, or directing a Reporting Bank to obtain a dedicated liquidity facility. 
 
3.17 
Where a Reporting Bank provides implicit support980 to a securitisation, it must 
comply with the requirements as set out in paragraph 7.6.105981. If a Reporting Bank is 
found to have provided implicit support on more than one occasion, action taken by the 
Authority may include –  
 
978 
A Reporting Bank should only execute clean-up calls for economic business purposes, such as when the 
cost of servicing the outstanding credit exposures exceeds the benefits of servicing the underlying credit 
exposures. 
979 
The Authority may increase the capital requirement for particular exposures or even increase the overall 
level of capital the Reporting Bank is required to hold in cases of a non-significant risk transfer. For example, 
this may be the case where both low quality unrated assets and most of the credit risk embedded in the 
exposures underlying the securitised transaction are likely to remain with the Reporting Bank as the 
originator. 
980 
Support to a transaction, whether contractual (i.e. credit enhancements provided at the inception of a 
securitised transaction) or non-contractual (implicit support) can take numerous forms. For example, 
contractual support can include over collateralisation, credit derivatives, spread accounts, contractual 
recourse obligations, subordinated notes, credit risk mitigants provided to a specific tranche, the 
subordination of fee or interest income or the deferral of margin income, and clean-up calls that exceed 10 
percent of the initial issuance. Implicit support to a securitisation includes purchase of deteriorating credit 
risk exposures from the underlying pool, the sale of discounted credit risk exposures into the pool of 
securitised credit risk exposures, the purchase of underlying exposures at above market price or an increase 
in the first loss position according to the deterioration of the underlying exposures. The provision of implicit 
support by a Reporting Bank to a securitisation signals to the market that the risk is still with the Reporting 
Bank and has not in effect been transferred. For traditional securitisation structures, the provision of implicit 
support undermines the clean sale criteria, which when satisfied would allow Reporting Banks to exclude 
the securitised assets from regulatory capital calculations. For synthetic securitisation structures, it negates 
the significance of risk transference. 
981 
The aim is to require a Reporting Bank to hold capital against exposures for which the Reporting Bank 
assumes the credit risk, and to discourage the Reporting Bank from providing implicit support. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-24 
 
 
(a) 
requiring a Reporting Bank to hold capital against all securitised assets of 
a Reporting Bank 982 , or requiring the Reporting Bank to treat all 
securitised assets of the Reporting Bank as if the underlying exposures 
were on the balance sheet of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(b) 
requiring a Reporting Bank to maintain additional capital above the capital 
adequacy ratio requirements set out in Part IV; or 
 
(c) 
disallowing a Reporting Bank from gaining capital relief on securitised 
assets for a period of time to be determined by the Authority. 
 
The Authority may disallow a Reporting Bank from gaining capital relief for planned 
securitisation transactions pending investigations by the Authority to determine implicit 
support provided by a Reporting Bank to a securitisation983. 
 
3.18 
A Reporting Bank must evaluate its capital adequacy taking into account the 
risks arising from securitisation, including new features of securitisation as they arise, and, 
where appropriate, set aside additional capital to address such risk. 
 
 
Section 4: Market Risk and Valuation Practices  
 
General Principles for the Management of Market Risk 
 
4.1 
A Reporting Bank must use methodologies that enable it to assess and actively 
manage all material market risks, wherever they arise – at position, desk, business line 
and group-wide level. The Reporting Bank must conduct stress testing appropriate to its 
market risk positions.984 
 
4.2 
For a Reporting Bank with significant market risks, the Reporting Bank must, in 
its assessment of the adequacy of the capital it maintains for market risk, base its 
assessment, at a minimum, on VaR modelling and stress testing. A Reporting Bank must 
also assess the market concentration risk that its positions in instruments might pose and 
the impact of market illiquidity of such instruments under stressful market scenarios. The 
Reporting Bank must supplement its VaR985 model with stress tests and other appropriate 
risk management techniques. 
 
4.3 
For the purposes of VaR modelling referred to in paragraph 4.2 of this Annex, 
a Reporting Bank must ensure that the VaR model identifies and measures risks arising 
from all its market risk positions and is integrated into the overall internal capital 
assessment of the Reporting Bank and subjected to rigorous ongoing validation. A 
 
982 
For example, by applying a CCF to the securitised assets as if the Reporting Bank has created a commitment 
to them. 
983 
The aim of the supervisory response in such cases would be to change the Reporting Bank's behaviour with 
regards to the provision of implicit support, and to correct market perception as to the willingness of the 
Reporting Bank to provide future recourse beyond contractual obligations. 
984 
For further guidance, the Reporting Bank should refer to relevant publications on the management of 
market risk issued by the BCBS and the Authority. 
985 
While VaR is an important tool in monitoring aggregate market risk exposures and provides a common 
metric for comparing the risk being run by different desks and business lines, it has its limitations. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-25 
Reporting Bank must also ensure that estimates of its VaR model are sensitive to changes 
in the Reporting Bank’s market risk profile. 
 
4.4 
In the internal capital assessment of a Reporting Bank, a Reporting Bank must 
demonstrate that it has enough capital to not only meet the regulatory capital 
requirements under Pillar 1, but also to withstand a range of severe but plausible market 
shocks. In particular, the Reporting Bank must conduct stress tests986 and factor in, where 
appropriate – 
 
(a) 
market illiquidity and pricing gaps; 
 
(b) 
concentrated positions (in relation to market turnover); 
 
(c) 
one-way markets; 
 
(d) 
non-linear products or deep out-of-the money positions; 
 
(e) 
events and jumps-to-defaults; 
 
(f) 
significant shifts in correlations; and 
 
(g) 
other risks that may not be captured appropriately in VaR987. 
 
4.5 
A Reporting Bank must reconcile the stress tests that it applies and, in particular, 
the calibration of those tests988 back to a clear statement setting out the premise upon 
which the internal capital assessment of the Reporting Bank is based989. 
 
4.6 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the market shocks applied in the stress 
tests reflect the nature of its market risk portfolios and the time it would take to hedge 
out or manage risks under severe market conditions. In particular, a Reporting Bank must 
pro-actively manage and assess concentration risk. A Reporting Bank must ensure that its 
concentrated positions are regularly reported to senior management. 
 
4.7 
A Reporting Bank must design its market risk management process and system, 
including the VaR methodology and stress tests, to properly measure the material risks in 
the instruments it trades as well as the trading strategy it pursues. As products and trading 
strategy change, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the VaR methodology and stress 
tests also evolve to accommodate the changes. 
 
4.8 
A Reporting Bank must be able to demonstrate how it combines its risk 
measurement approaches to arrive at the overall internal capital for market risk. 
 
4.9 
A Reporting Bank must maintain sufficient capital to meet the regulatory capital 
requirements under Pillar 1 and to cover the results of its market risk stress tests. The 
Authority will consider whether the Reporting Bank has sufficient capital for these 
 
986 
For example, factor shocks or integrated scenarios, whether historical or hypothetical. 
987 
For example, recovery rate uncertainty, implied correlations or skew risk. 
988 
For example, the parameters of the shocks or types of events considered. 
989 
For example, ensuring there is adequate capital to manage the market risk portfolios within stated limits 
through what may be a prolonged period of market stress and illiquidity, or that there is adequate capital 
to ensure that, over a given time horizon to a specified confidence level, all positions can be liquidated or 
the risk hedged in an orderly fashion. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-26 
purposes, where required, taking into account the nature and scale of the Reporting Bank's 
market risk positions, and any other relevant factors including valuation adjustments made 
by the Reporting Bank. To the extent that a Reporting Bank does not have sufficient capital 
to meet the regulatory capital requirements under Pillar 1 and to cover the results of its 
market risk stress tests, or if the Authority is not satisfied with the premise upon which 
the Reporting Bank’s internal capital assessment for market risk is based, the Authority 
will take appropriate action, which may include instructing the Reporting Bank to reduce 
its risk exposures or maintain additional capital, so that it meets the regulatory capital 
requirements under Pillar 1 and covers the results of a stress test acceptable to the 
Authority. 
 
 
Policies and Procedures for Trading Book Eligibility 
 
4.10 
In order to ensure consistency and integrity in the computation of regulatory 
capital for the trading book of a Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank must establish clear 
policies and procedures to determine those exposures that may be included in, and those 
that must be excluded from, the trading book. In addition, the Reporting Bank must ensure 
that transfers of positions between banking and trading books occur only in a very limited 
set of circumstances. 
 
4.11 
A Reporting Bank must demonstrate to the Authority that its policies and 
procedures clearly delineate the boundaries of its trading book, and is consistent with its 
risk management capabilities and practices. 
 
4.12 
A Reporting Bank must have a trading book policy statement which covers, at 
a minimum, the policies and procedures, including the methodologies, by which the 
Reporting Bank – 
 
(a) 
defines its trading book and identifies positions to be included in its trading 
book; 
 
(b) 
allocates positions between the banking book and the trading book; 
 
(c) 
actively manages and values its positions in the trading book; 
 
(d) 
measures its trading book risks; and 
 
(e) 
controls the transfer of positions between the banking book and the 
trading book. 
 
4.13 
A Reporting Bank must obtain the approval of the Board on its trading book 
policy statement. The Reporting Bank must review and where necessary update its trading 
book policy statement, at least annually. The Reporting Bank must obtain the approval of 
the Board for all significant changes made to its trading book policy statement. 
 
4.14 
A Reporting Bank must document how it complies with the policies and 
procedures specified in its trading book policy statement. 
 
4.15 
A Reporting Bank must, at a minimum, ensure that the policies and procedures 
in its trading book policy statement address the following: 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-27 
(a) 
the activities the Reporting Bank considers to be trading or hedging of 
positions in the trading book; 
 
(b) 
a documented trading strategy990 for every position or portfolio in the 
trading book; 
 
(c) 
standards regarding the extent to which a position in the trading book 
must be marked-to-market daily by reference to a liquid two-way market; 
 
(d) 
for positions in the trading book which are marked-to-model, the 
standards for – 
 
(i) 
identifying the material risks of a position; 
 
(ii) 
hedging the material risks of the position and the extent to which the 
hedging instruments would have a liquid two-way market; and 
 
(iii) deriving estimates for the key assumptions and parameters used in 
the model; 
 
(e) 
the extent to which the Reporting Bank is required to generate valuations 
for positions in the trading book, which can be validated by its auditors or 
the Authority in a consistent manner; 
 
(f) 
the extent to which legal restrictions or other operational requirements 
would impede the Reporting Bank’s ability to effect an immediate 
liquidation of a position in the trading book; 
 
(g) 
the processes constituting active management of positions in the trading 
book, which must include – 
 
(i) 
the setting of limits and ongoing monitoring for appropriateness;  
 
(ii) 
each trading desk having –  
 
(A) a documented trading strategy (“trading desk trading 
strategy”); and 
 
(B) a process for monitoring the positions in the trading desk 
against the trading strategy referred to in sub-paragraph (b) 
and the trading desk trading strategy, including that –  
 
(I) 
for any trading desk, the Reporting Bank must ensure that 
senior management is responsible for ensuring that every 
position or portfolio in the trading desk is held for one or 
more of the purposes listed in paragraph 8.1.24 and 
managed in accordance with the trading desk trading 
strategy; and 
 
 
990 
For example, setting out the expected holding horizon for a position or portfolio, and possible actions if the 
expected holding horizon is breached. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-28 
(II) the monitoring process includes evaluation of turnover 
and stale positions in order to determine compliance with 
specified holding periods; 
 
(iii) the degree of autonomy a trader has to enter into or manage 
positions within agreed limits and according to the trading desk 
trading strategy and the trading strategy referred to in sub-
paragraph (b); 
 
(iv) the production of reports on activities in the trading book and process 
for providing them to senior management; and 
 
(v) 
the active monitoring of positions in the trading book, with reference 
to market information sources, including –

and risk profile of positions and portfolios; 
 
(B) analysis of changes in the market values of positions and 
sensitivities due to changes in risk factors; and 
 
(C) evaluation of the quality and availability of market inputs to the

the treatment of transactions between trading desks; 
 
(j) 
the identification and management of its structural foreign exchange 
positions. 
 
4.16 
For the purposes of paragraph 4.15 of this Annex, a liquid two-way market 
means a market where there are independent bona fide offers to buy and sell so that a 
price reasonably related to the last sales price or current bona fide competitive bid and 
offer quotations can be determined within one day and trades settled at such price within 
a relatively short time conforming to trade custom. 
 
Policies and Procedures for internal risk transfers from the banking book to the 
trading book 
 
4.17 
A Reporting Bank must –  
 
 (a) 
document all internal risk transfers from the banking book to the trading 
book, with respect to the banking book risk being hedged and the amount 
of such risk; 
 
(b) 
document the details of any external third party matching hedge; 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-29 
 
(c) 
submit a list of the procedures and strategies to manage the risks that the 
internal risk transfer desk undertake, which is approved by the Reporting 
Bank’s senior management at both of the following instances: 
 
(i) 
when seeking the Authority’s approval for a dedicated internal risk 
transfer trading desk for internal risk transfers from the banking 
book to the trading book pursuant to paragraph 8.1.51(b); 
 
(ii) 
at the request of the Authority; 
 
(d) 
ensure regular and consistent reporting of its internal risk transfer 
activities for risk management and control purposes; and 
 
(e) 
provide information on its internal risk transfer activities which are used 
for risk management and control purposes to the Authority on a regular 
basis. 
 
4.18 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its trading desks that undertake internal 
risk transfers document all transactions that have been implemented. 
 
4.19 
A Reporting Bank must have a consistent methodology for identifying and 
quantifying the banking book risk to be hedged through internal risk transfers. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that such methodology is integrated in the Reporting Bank’s 
risk management framework and includes all the qualitative and quantitative regulatory 
requirements pertaining to trading desks in this Notice. The Reporting Bank may only 
implement material changes to the methodology after it has obtained approval from a 
committee with senior management of the Reporting Bank991 responsible for such matters 
and the Authority. 
 
4.20 
A Reporting Bank must implement risk management methods and internal 
controls, to ensure and control the effectiveness of risk mitigation for its internal risk 
transfer transactions. The Reporting Bank must ensure that these methods and controls 
are appropriate for the amount, types, and risks of the Reporting Bank’s internal risk 
transfer activities. The Reporting Bank must ensure that its risk management and risk 
control functions regularly review these methods and controls. 
 
Valuation992 
 
4.21 
A Reporting Bank must have adequate governance structures and control 
processes, that explicitly cover the role of the Board and senior management, for the fair 
valuation of exposures for risk management and financial reporting purposes. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the valuation governance structures and processes are 
consistent for both risk management and reporting purposes. A Reporting Bank must also 
 
991 
For example, the asset and liability management committee of the Reporting Bank. 
992 
Prudent valuation policies and procedures are the foundation on which a robust assessment of market risk 
capital adequacy should be built. A Reporting Bank should establish sound valuation policies and procedures 
adopting international best practices wherever possible. For further guidance, a Reporting Bank should 
refer to “Supervisory Guidance for Assessing Banks’ Financial Instrument Fair Value Practices” issued by 
the BCBS in April 2009, “Fair Value Measurement and Modelling: An Assessment of Challenges and Lessons 
Learned from the Market Stress” issued by the BCBS in May 2008, and any other relevant publications 
issued by the BCBS and the Authority in this area. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-30 
have clear and robust governance structures for the production, assignment and 
verification of instrument valuations. A Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board 
receives reports from senior management on the valuation oversight and valuation model 
performance issues that are brought to senior management for resolution, and all 
significant changes to valuation policies. A Reporting Bank must ensure that the approvals 
of all valuation methodologies are well documented. In addition, a Reporting Bank must 
set forth the range of acceptable practices for initial pricing, marking-to-market, valuation 
adjustments and periodic independent revaluation in its policies and procedures. A 
Reporting Bank must also include all internal stakeholders relevant to risk measurement, 
risk control, and the assignment and verification of valuations of instruments as part of 
the new product approval process. 
 
4.22 
A Reporting Bank must apply control processes for measuring and reporting 
valuations consistently across the banking group and integrate these control processes 
with risk measurement and management processes. In particular, the Reporting Bank 
must ensure that valuation controls are applied consistently across similar instruments 
and risks, and across business lines. The Reporting Bank must subject these controls to 
internal audit. Regardless of the booking location of a new product, a Reporting Bank must 
ensure that reviews and approval of valuation methodologies are guided by a minimum 
set of considerations. Furthermore, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the approval 
process is supported by a transparent, well-documented inventory of acceptable valuation 
methodologies that are specific to products and businesses. 
 
4.23 
A Reporting Bank must demonstrate to the Authority that it has maintained 
sufficient capital to close out or hedge its positions within the liquidity horizons set out in 
Table 8-24 in an orderly fashion even in adverse market conditions. 
 
4.24 
A Reporting Bank must consider whether additional capital should be 
maintained for portfolios exhibiting any of the following characteristics: 
 
(a) 
less well diversified portfolios; 
 
(b) 
portfolios containing less liquid instruments; 
 
(c) 
portfolios with concentrations in relation to market turnover; 
 
(d) 
portfolios which contain large numbers of positions that are marked-to-
model. 
 
4.25 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that it maintains sufficient capital for portfolios 
with limited liquidity or price transparency. 
 
4.26 
Where the Authority considers that there is a capital shortfall or that the 
effectiveness of a Reporting Bank’s internal models to capture risk is undermined, the 
Authority will take appropriate measures which may include requiring the Reporting Bank 
to reduce its risk, hold additional capital, or exclude positions from the Reporting Bank’s 
calculation of market risk capital requirements using its internal models and using the 
SA(MR) for such positions instead. 
 
4.27 
 A Reporting Bank must have adequate capacity, including during periods of 
stress, to establish and verify valuations for instruments and transactions in which it 
engages. The Reporting Bank must ensure that this capacity is commensurate with the 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-31 
importance, riskiness and size of the exposures in the context of the business profile of 
the Reporting Bank. In addition, for those exposures that represent material risk, the 
Reporting Bank must have the capacity to produce valuations using alternative methods 
in the event that primary inputs and approaches become unreliable, unavailable or not 
relevant due to market discontinuities or illiquidity. A Reporting Bank must test and review 
the performance of its models under stress conditions so that it understands the limitations 
of the models under stress conditions.  
 
4.28 
A Reporting Bank must apply the Accounting Standards to determine the 
relevant market information and other factors likely to have a material effect on an 
instrument's fair value when selecting the appropriate inputs to use in the valuation 
process.993 In assessing whether a source is reliable and relevant, a Reporting Bank must 
consider, among other things – 
 
(a) 
the frequency and availability of the prices and quotes; 
 
(b) 
whether those prices represent actual regularly occurring transactions on 
an arm's length basis; 
 
(c) 
the breadth of the distribution of the data and whether it is generally 
available to the relevant participants in the market; 
 
(d) 
the timeliness of the information relative to the frequency of valuations; 
 
(e) 
the number of independent sources that produce the prices and quotes; 
 
(f) 
whether the prices and quotes are supported by actual transactions; 
 
(g) 
the maturity of the market; and 
 
(h) 
the similarity between the instrument sold in a transaction and the 
instrument held by the Reporting Bank. 
 
4.29 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that public disclosures around valuation 
uncertainty are meaningful 994. A Reporting Bank must regularly review its disclosure 
policies to ensure that the information disclosed continues to be relevant to its business 
model and products, and to current market conditions. 
 
 
Section 5: Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book 
 
5.1 
IRRBB is the risk to a Reporting Bank’s capital and earnings arising from adverse 
movements in interest rates that affect the Reporting Bank’s banking book positions. 
 
 
993 
The relevance and reliability of valuations is directly related to the quality and reliability of the inputs. 
994 
For example, the Reporting Bank may describe the modelling techniques and the instruments to which they 
are applied, the sensitivity of fair values to modelling inputs and assumptions, and the impact of stress 
scenarios on valuations. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-32 
5.2 
A Reporting Bank must identify its sources of IRRBB995 and take appropriate 
steps to measure, monitor and control IRRBB996. 
 
5.3 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
identify any IRRBB inherent in the products held or offered by it, and the 
activities carried out by it; and 
 
(b) 
ensure that there are adequate procedures and controls to measure, 
monitor and control the IRRBB inherent in such products and activities. 
 
5.4 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
ensure that its internal policies require the approval of significant hedging 
or risk management strategies to be obtained before being implemented; 
 
(b) 
ensure that the approval of its significant hedging or risk management 
strategies is obtained in accordance with its internal policies; 
 
(c) 
conduct a pre-acquisition review of all products and activities that are new 
to it to ensure that it understands the IRRBB associated with such products 
and activities; 
 
(d) 
subject such products and activities to a predetermined test phase before 
fully rolling out the product or commencing the activity; 
 
(e) 
put in place adequate operational procedures and risk control systems to 
measure, monitor and control IRRBB prior to introducing a new product, 
hedging or risk-taking strategy; and 
 
(f) 
ensure that the management of IRRBB is integrated within its broader risk 
management framework and aligned with its business planning and 
budgeting activities. 
 
IRRBB Management Framework and Risk Appetite 
 
5.5 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
 
995 
There are 3 main types of IRRBB that may potentially change the value or earnings of interest rate-sensitive 
assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in a way, or at a time, that can adversely affect a Reporting 
Bank’s financial condition – 
(a) gap risk, which describes the risk arising from the term structure of banking book instruments, and 
the timing of interest rate changes; 
(b) basis risk, which describes the risk arising from relative changes in interest rates for banking book 
instruments that have similar tenors but are priced using different interest rate indices; and 
(c) option risk, which describes the risk arising from option derivative positions or from optionalities 
embedded in the Reporting Bank’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the banking book, 
where the Reporting Bank or its counterparty can alter the level and timing of their cash flows. Option 
risk can be further characterised into automatic option risk and behavioural option risk. 
996 
A Reporting Bank should also monitor and assess CSRBB in its interest rate risk management framework. 
CSRBB refers to any kind of asset or liability spread risk of instruments with credit risk that is not explained 
by IRRBB or by the expected credit or jump to default risk. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

(a) 
have in place an adequate IRRBB management framework to effectively 
manage IRRBB; and 
 
(b) 
ensure that the framework is reviewed and evaluated for its effectiveness 
by an independent party on a regular basis. 
 
5.6 
Despite paragraph 5.7 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the 
Board is responsible for oversight of – 
 
(a) 
the IRRBB management framework referred to in paragraph 5.5 of this 
Annex; and 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank’s risk appetite for IRRBB997. 
 
5.7 
The Board may delegate the task of developing IRRBB policies and practices to 
the senior management of the Reporting Bank or an asset and liability management 
committee (“ALCO”) (collectively referred to in this Section as “delegates”). 
 
5.8 
Where the Board has made a delegation under paragraph 5.7 of this Annex, the 
Reporting Bank must do the following: 
 
(a) 
where the task for developing IRRBB policies and practices is delegated to 
an ALCO, ensure that the ALCO meets regularly and includes 
representatives from each major department connected to IRRBB998; 
 
(b) 
ensure that the Board clearly identifies the delegates for managing IRRBB 
and oversees the adequate separation of responsibilities in key elements 
of the risk management process to avoid potential conflicts of interest; 
 
(c) 
ensure that the delegates have clear lines of authority over the units 
responsible for establishing and managing IRRBB positions and that there 
is a clear communication channel to convey the delegates’ directives to 
these units; 
 
(d) 
ensure that the Board puts in place an organisational structure that 
enables the delegates to carry out their responsibilities effectively and 
facilitates effective decision-making and good governance999. 
 
 
997 
A Reporting Bank should have clearly defined risk appetite statements (i.e. a written articulation of the 
aggregated level and types of IRRBB exposures that the Reporting Bank will accept, or avoid, in order to 
achieve its business objectives) that are approved by the Board and implemented through comprehensive 
risk appetite frameworks (i.e. policies and procedures for limiting and controlling IRRBB). A Reporting Bank 
should articulate its risk appetite for IRRBB in terms of the risk to both economic value and earnings. A 
Reporting Bank should ensure that its risk appetite frameworks – 
(a) delineate delegated powers, lines of responsibility and accountability over IRRBB management 
decisions; and 
(b) clearly define authorised instruments, hedging strategies and risk-taking opportunities. 
998 
For example, this includes a department which is – 
(a) responsible for the risk identification, measurement, monitoring or control of IRRBB; or 
(b) responsible for risk-taking functions that contribute to the Reporting Bank’s IRRBB. 
999 
The Board should encourage discussions between its members and the delegates, as well as between the 
delegates and personnel in units responsible for establishing and managing IRRBB positions in the Reporting 
Bank, regarding the IRRBB management process. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-34 
5.9 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.6 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must do the 
following: 
 
(a) 
ensure that the Board – 
 
(i) 
understands the nature and the level of the Reporting Bank’s IRRBB 
exposure; 
 
(ii) 
approves broad business strategies and overall policies with respect 
to IRRBB; and 
 
(iii) provides clear guidance regarding the acceptable level of IRRBB, 
given the Reporting Bank’s business strategies; 
 
(b) 
ensure that the Board is responsible for ensuring that senior management 
has the capability and skills to understand IRRBB, and that adequate 
resources are devoted to IRRBB management; 
 
(c) 
ensure that the Board oversees the steps taken to identify, measure, 
monitor and control IRRBB and ensure that they are consistent with the 
approved strategies and policies of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(d) 
ensure that the Board or, where the Board has made a delegation under 
paragraph 5.7 of this Annex, the delegates, establishes the following: 
 
(i) 
appropriate limits on IRRBB, including the definition of specific 
procedures and approvals necessary for exceptions, and ensuring 
compliance with those limits; 
 
(ii) 
adequate systems and standards for measuring IRRBB; 
 
(iii) standards for measuring IRRBB, valuing positions and assessing 
performance, including procedures for updating interest rate shock 
and stress scenarios and key underlying assumptions driving the 
Reporting Bank’s IRRBB analysis; 
 
(iv) a comprehensive IRRBB reporting and review process; 
 
(v) 
effective internal controls and management information system; 
 
(e) 
ensure that the Board or, where the Board has made a delegation under 
paragraph 5.7 of this Annex, the delegates, oversees the approval, 
implementation and review of IRRBB management policies, procedures 
and limits; 
 
(f) where the Board has made a delegation under paragraph 5.7 of this Annex, 
ensure that the Board regularly reviews timely information that is 
sufficiently detailed to allow it to understand and assess the performance 
of the delegates in monitoring and controlling IRRBB in compliance with 
policies approved by the Board. The Reporting Bank must carry out such 
reviews more frequently when the Reporting Bank runs significant IRRBB 
exposures or has positions in complex IRRBB instruments; 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-35 
 
(g) 
ensure that the Board understands the implications of the Reporting 
Bank’s IRRBB strategies, including the potential linkages with, and impact 
on, market, liquidity, credit and operational risks; 
 
(h) 
ensure that more than one member of the Board has sufficient technical 
knowledge to be able to question and challenge any report concerning 
IRRBB that is presented to the Board; 
 
(i) 
have IRRBB identification, measurement, monitoring and control functions 
with clearly defined responsibilities that are sufficiently independent from 
risk-taking functions of the Reporting Bank and that report IRRBB 
exposures directly to the Board or its delegates1000; 
 
(j) 
ensure that its risk management and strategic planning areas 
communicate regularly to facilitate evaluations of risk arising from future 
business. 
 
5.10 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.5 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must do the 
following as part of its IRRBB management process: 
 
(a) 
implement adequate internal controls that promote effective and efficient 
operations, reliable financial and regulatory reporting, and compliance 
with relevant laws, regulations and internal policies of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(b) 
with regard to IRRBB control policies and procedures, implement 
appropriate approval processes, exposure limits, reviews and other 
mechanisms designed to provide a reasonable assurance that risk 
management objectives are being achieved; 
 
(c) 
ensure that evaluations and reviews of the Reporting Bank’s internal 
control system and risk management processes, including that personnel 
comply with established policies and procedures, are conducted on a 
regular basis by individuals who, or units which, are independent of the 
functions that they are assigned to evaluate and review; 
 
(d) 
ensure that the evaluations and reviews done pursuant to sub-paragraph 
(c) address any significant change, including any change in market 
conditions, personnel, technology and structures of compliance with 
exposure limits, which may affect the effectiveness of controls and that 
there are appropriate escalation procedures for any exceeded limits; 
 
(e) 
where revisions or enhancements to internal controls are warranted, 
ensure that an internal review mechanism is in place to ensure that such 
revisions or enhancements to internal controls are implemented in a timely 
manner; 
 
 
1000 
The Reporting Bank should inform the Board regularly (at least semi-annually) on the level and trend of 
the Reporting Bank’s IRRBB exposures. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-36 
(f) 
ensure that its IRRBB identification, measurement, monitoring and control 
processes are reviewed by an independent auditing function 1001 on a 
regular basis; 
 
(g) 
where a written report has been produced in respect of a review under 
sub-paragraph (f), by the internal or external auditors or other equivalent 
external parties1002 which conducted the review, make the written report 
available to the Authority. 
 
5.11 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that all IRRBB policies are periodically 
reviewed1003. 
 
5.12 
A Reporting Bank must implement policy limits set by the Board that target 
maintaining IRRBB exposures that are consistent with the Reporting Bank’s risk appetite. 
 
5.13 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.12 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must do 
the following: 
 
(a) 
before implementing the policy limits set by the Board, ensure that such 
limits are consistent with the Reporting Bank’s overall approach for 
measuring IRRBB; 
 
(b) 
apply aggregate risk limits, clearly articulating the amount of IRRBB 
acceptable to the Board, on a consolidated basis and, as appropriate, at 
the level of individual banking group entities1004. The Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the interest rate movements used in developing these limits 
represent meaningful shock and stress situations, taking into account 
historical interest rate volatility and the time required by management to 
mitigate those risk exposures; 
 
(c) 
ensure that policy limits to be implemented are appropriate to the nature, 
size, complexity and capital adequacy of the Reporting Bank, as well as its 
ability to measure and manage its risks1005. The Reporting Bank must 
ensure that the level of detail of risk limits reflects the characteristics of 
the Reporting Bank’s holdings, including the various sources of the 
Reporting Bank’s IRRBB exposures1006; 
 
(d) 
ensure that the Board or its delegates, as the case may be, approve major 
hedging or risk-taking initiatives in advance of implementation1007. The 
 
1001 
For example, an internal or external auditor. 
1002 
For example, consultants. 
1003 
A Reporting Bank should review its IRRBB policies at least annually, and revise its IRRBB policies as needed. 
1004 
A Reporting Bank may associate limits with specific scenarios of changes in interest rates or term structures, 
such as an increase or decrease in interest rates of a particular magnitude or a change in shape of the term 
structure. 
1005 
Depending on the nature of the Reporting Bank's activities and business model, the Reporting Bank may 
also identify sub-limits for individual business units, portfolios, instrument types or specific instruments. 
1006 
Where the Reporting Bank has significant exposures to gap risk, basis risk or positions with explicit or 
embedded options, the Reporting Bank should establish risk tolerances appropriate for these risks. 
1007 
The Reporting Bank should develop a dedicated set of risk limits to monitor the evolution of hedging 
strategies that rely on instruments such as derivatives, and to control mark-to-market risks in instruments 
that are accounted for at market value. The Reporting Bank should assess proposals to use new instrument 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-37 
Reporting Bank must ensure that positions related to internal risk transfers 
between its banking book and trading book are properly documented; 
 
(e) 
put in place systems to ensure that positions that exceed, or are likely to 
exceed, limits defined by the Board or its delegates are escalated to the 
Board or the delegates without delay and receive prompt management 
attention. The Reporting Bank must ensure that there is a clear policy on 
who will be informed, how the communication will take place and the 
actions which will be taken in response to an exception1008. 
 
IRRBB Measurement 
 
5.14 
Except where paragraph 5.15 of this Annex applies, a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
have in place its own IMS to measure its IRRBB; 
 
(b) 
adopt the SA(IR) wholly as its IMS; or 
 
(c) 
adopt the SA(IR) in part as its IMS, and have in place its own IMS to 
measure its IRRBB in the parts where the SA(IR) is not adopted. 
 
5.15 
The Authority may, as it considers necessary, require a Reporting Bank to adopt 
the SA(IR), wholly or in part, as its IMS. Where the Authority requires a Reporting Bank 
to adopt the SA(IR) in part as its IMS, the Reporting Bank must have in place its own IMS 
to measure its IRRBB in the parts where the SA(IR) is not adopted. 
 
5.16 
A Reporting Bank must capture all material sources of IRRBB and assess the 
effect of market changes on the scope of its activities through its IMS. 
 
5.17 
A Reporting Bank must measure its IRRBB by assessing the potential impact of 
interest rate shock and stress scenarios on its economic value and earnings1009. 
 
types or new strategies (including hedging) to ensure that the resources required to establish sound and 
effective IRRBB management of the product or activity have been identified, that the proposed activities 
are in line with the Reporting Bank’s overall risk appetite, and procedures to identify, measure, monitor 
and control the risks of the proposed product or activity have been established. 
1008 
The Reporting Bank may set limits that are absolute in the sense that they should never be exceeded or in 
a manner where, under specific circumstances, breaches of such limits are tolerated for a predetermined 
short period of time. 
1009 
While economic value and earnings-based measures share certain commonalities, it is important to manage 
IRRBB through both measures. If a Reporting Bank solely minimises its economic value risk by matching 
the repricing of its assets with liabilities beyond the short term, it could run the risk of earnings volatility. 
A Reporting Bank should ensure that its IRRBB policy takes into account the impact of an interest rate 
shock on its economic value, as well as its ability to generate stable earnings sufficient to maintain its 
normal business operations. A Reporting Bank should pay attention to the complementary nature of 
economic value and earnings-based measures in its risk and internal capital assessments, in particular in 
terms of – 
(a) outcomes, where economic value measures compute a change in the net present value of the Reporting 
Bank’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items subject to specific interest rate shock and stress 
scenarios, while earnings-based measures focus on changes to future profitability within a given time 
horizon eventually affecting future levels of the Reporting Bank’s own equity capital; 
(b) assessment horizons, where economic value measures reflect changes in value over the remaining life 
of the Reporting Bank’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, that is, until all positions have 
run off, while earnings-based measures cover only the short to medium term, and therefore do not 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-38 
 
5.18 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.17 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
ensure that its IMS is able to calculate the impact on its economic value and earnings 
based on the following scenarios: 
 
(a) 
interest rate shock scenarios selected by the Reporting Bank addressing 
the Reporting Bank’s risk profile, according to its ICAAP1010; 
 
(b) 
historical and hypothetical interest rate stress scenarios, which tend to be 
more severe than shock scenarios; 
 
(c) 
the 6 standardised interest rate shock scenarios set out in Annex 10C; 
 
(d) 
any additional interest rate shock scenarios required by the Authority. 
 
5.19 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.17 of this Annex, the Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
measure its vulnerability to loss under stressful market conditions1011, and 
consider those results when establishing and reviewing its policies and 
limits for IRRBB; 
 
(b) 
develop and implement an effective stress testing framework for IRRBB 
as part of its broader risk management and governance processes which 
must feed into the decision-making process at the appropriate 
management level, including strategic decisions1012 of the Board or its 
delegates; 
 
(c) ensure that IRRBB stress testing is considered in its ICAAP, and is rigorous, 
forward-looking and identifies events of severe changes in market 
conditions which could adversely impact the Reporting Bank’s capital or 
earnings, including through changes in the behaviour of its customer base; 
 
(d) 
develop a stress testing framework for IRRBB that includes clearly defined 
objectives, scenarios tailored to the Reporting Bank’s businesses and risks, 
well-documented 
assumptions 
and 
sound 
methodologies, 
and 
is 
commensurate with the Reporting Bank’s nature, size and complexity as 
well as business activities and overall risk profile; 
 
 
fully capture risks that will continue to impact profit and loss accounts beyond the period of estimation; 
and 
(c) future business or production, where economic value measures consider the net present value of 
repricing cash flows of instruments on the Reporting Bank’s balance sheet or accounted for as an off-
balance sheet item (i.e. a run-off view). In addition to a run-off view, earnings measures may assume 
rollover of maturing items (i.e. a constant balance sheet view), or assess the scenario-consistent 
impact on the Reporting Bank’s future earnings inclusive of future business (i.e. a dynamic view), or 
both. A dynamic view can be useful for business planning and budgeting purposes. However, dynamic 
approaches are dependent on key variables and assumptions that are extremely difficult to project 
with accuracy over an extended period and can potentially hide certain key underlying risk exposures. 
1010 
A Reporting Bank should observe the guidelines in Section 1 of Annex 10D in the selection process for its 
internal interest rate shock and stress scenarios. 
1011 
These should include conditions under which key business assumptions and parameters break down. 
1012 
For example, business and capital planning decisions. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-39 
(e) 
use the framework to assess the potential impact of the scenarios on the 
Reporting Bank’s financial condition, enable ongoing and effective review 
processes for stress tests and recommend actions based on the stress test 
results; and 
 
(f) 
ensure that IRRBB stress tests are used in the communication of risks, 
within the Reporting Bank, with the Authority, and with the market 
through appropriate disclosures. 
 
5.20 
In measuring IRRBB, a Reporting Bank must ensure that its key behavioural 
and modelling assumptions are fully understood, conceptually sound and reasonable, 
consistent with historical experience, and documented1013. 
 
5.21 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
when assessing its IRRBB exposure, make judgments and assumptions 
about how an instrument’s actual maturity or repricing behaviour may 
vary from the instrument’s respective contractual terms because of 
behavioural optionalities, for the following products: 
 
(i) 
fixed rate loans subject to prepayment risk1014; 
 
(ii) fixed rate loan commitments1015; 
 
(iii) term deposits subject to early redemption risk1016; 
 
(iv) NMDs1017; 
 
1013 
A Reporting Bank should ensure that all behavioural and modelling assumptions in measuring IRRBB are 
rigorously tested and aligned with the Reporting Bank’s business strategies. A Reporting Bank should also 
note that both economic value and earnings-based measures of IRRBB can be significantly impacted by the 
following assumptions made by the Reporting Bank for the purposes of risk quantification: 
(a) expectations for the exercise of interest rate options (explicit and embedded) by both the Reporting 
Bank and its customers under specific interest rate shock and stress scenarios; 
(b) treatment of balances and interest flows arising from non-maturity deposits; 
(c) treatment of own equity in economic value measures; 
(d) the implications of accounting practices for IRRBB. 
1014 
For fixed rate loans subject to prepayment risk, a Reporting Bank should – 
(a) understand the nature of prepayment risk for its portfolios and make reasonable and prudent estimates 
of the expected prepayments; and 
(b) document the assumptions underlying the estimates, including assumptions of how prepayment 
penalties or other contractual features affect the embedded optionality effect. 
1015 
For fixed rate loan commitments, a Reporting Bank may sell options to retail customers (for example, 
prospective mortgage buyers or renewers) whereby, for a limited period, the customers can choose to draw 
down a loan at a committed rate. Unlike loan commitments to corporates, where drawdowns strongly reflect 
characteristics of automatic interest rate options, mortgage commitments (that is, pipelines) to retail 
customers are impacted by other drivers. 
1016 
An example of a term deposit subject to early redemption risk is one where a Reporting Bank attracts 
deposits with a contractual maturity term or with step-up clauses that enable the depositor at different 
time periods to modify the speed of redemption. For term deposits subject to early redemption risk, a 
Reporting Bank should document whether a term deposit is deemed to be subject to redemption penalties 
or other contractual features that preserve the cash flow profile of the instrument. 
1017 
Behavioural assumptions for deposits that have no specific repricing date can be a major determinant of 
IRRBB exposures under the economic value and earnings-based measures. A Reporting Bank should 
document, monitor and regularly update key assumptions for NMD balances and behaviour used in its IMS. 
To determine the appropriate assumptions for its NMDs, the Reporting Bank should analyse its depositor 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-40 
 
(v) 
any other product that the Reporting Bank considers relevant; 
 
(b) 
assess exposures in each currency since yield curves vary from currency 
to currency and a Reporting Bank with positions denominated in different 
currencies may be exposed to IRRBB in each of those currencies. Where 
a Reporting Bank uses its own IMS pursuant to paragraph 5.14(a) or (c) 
of this Annex, a Reporting Bank with the necessary skills and 
sophistication, and with material multicurrency exposures, may choose to 
include, in its own IMS, methods to aggregate its IRRBB in different 
currencies using assumptions about the correlation between interest rates 
in different currencies; 
 
(c) 
consider the materiality of the impact of behavioural optionalities within 
floating rate loans1018; 
 
(d) 
where a Reporting Bank uses its own IMS pursuant to paragraph 5.14(a) 
or (c) of this Annex, test the appropriateness of key behavioural 
assumptions1019, and document all changes to the assumptions of key 
parameters1020; and 
 
(e) 
ensure that the most significant assumptions underlying the system are 
documented and clearly understood by the Board or its delegates1021. 
 
5.22 
A Reporting Bank must assess the expected average prepayment speed of a 
product that is a fixed rate loan subject to prepayment risk under each interest rate shock 
and stress scenario. 
 
5.23 
A Reporting Bank must carefully consider how the exercise of embedded 
behavioural options will vary under interest rate shock and stress scenarios and any other 
applicable dimension1022, in respect of the following products: 
 
(a) 
fixed rate loans subject to prepayment risk; 
 
(b) 
fixed rate loan commitments; 
 
base in order to identify the proportion of core deposits (i.e. NMDs which are unlikely to reprice even under 
significant changes in interest rate environment). A Reporting Bank should vary assumptions according to 
depositor characteristics (e.g. retail or wholesale) and account characteristics (e.g. transactional or non-
transactional). 
1018 
For example, the Reporting Bank should consider the potential impact of the behavior of prepayments 
arising from embedded interest rate caps and floors on the Reporting Bank’s EVE. 
1019 
For example, by comparing the economic value of equity measured under its own IMS, with the economic 
value of equity measured under the SA(IR) set out in Annex 10B. 
1020 
The Reporting Bank should periodically perform sensitivity analyses with reference to both economic value 
and earnings-based measures for key assumptions to monitor their impact on measured IRRBB. 
1021 
The Reporting Bank should ensure that such documentation includes descriptions on how those 
assumptions could potentially affect the Reporting Bank’s hedging strategies. The Reporting Bank should 
review significant measurement assumptions at least annually and more frequently during rapidly changing 
market conditions, as market conditions, competitive environments and strategies change over time. For 
example, if the competitive market has changed such that consumers now have lower transaction costs 
available to them for refinancing their residential mortgages, the Reporting Bank should consider that 
prepayments may become more sensitive to smaller reductions in interest rates. 
1022 
The other applicable dimensions in respect of the products set out in paragraph 5.23(a) to (e) of this Annex 
may include the dimensions set out in column (B) of Table 10D-1. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-41 
 
(c) 
term deposits subject to early redemption risk; 
 
(d) 
NMDs; and 
 
(e) 
any other product with embedded behavioural options. 
 
5.24 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that any measurement system and model used 
for the calculation of IRRBB1023 – 
 
(a) 
is based on accurate data; and 
 
(b) 
is subject to appropriate documentation, testing and controls to give 
assurance on the accuracy of the calculation. 
 
5.25 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its IMS – 
 
(a) is able to calculate economic value and earnings-based measures of IRRBB, 
as well as other measures of IRRBB prescribed by the Authority, based on 
the interest rate shock and stress scenarios set out in paragraph 5.18 of 
this Annex; and 
 
(b) 
is sufficiently flexible to incorporate any constraints imposed by the 
Authority on the Reporting Bank’s internal risk parameter estimates. 
 
5.26 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that its models used to measure IRRBB are 
comprehensive and covered by governance processes for model risk management, 
including a validation function that is independent of the development process1024. 
 
5.27 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the measurement outcomes of IRRBB and 
hedging strategies are reported to the Board or its delegates on a regular basis, at relevant 
levels of aggregation, by consolidation level and currency1025. 
 
Internal Assessment of Capital Adequacy for IRRBB 
 
5.28 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
evaluate its capital adequacy for IRRBB1026, which must be in line with its 
risk appetite, as part of its ICAAP approved by the Board; 
 
(b) 
ensure that it has adequate capital and earnings that are commensurate 
with its level of short-term and long-term IRRBB exposures; and 
 
(c) 
consider the potential risk that such exposures mentioned in sub-
paragraph (b) may pose to its future financial performance. 
 
 
1023 
A Reporting Bank should also observe the guidelines set out in paragraph 2.2 of Annex 10D. 
1024 
A Reporting Bank should also observe the guidelines set out in paragraph 2.3 of Annex 10D. 
1025 
A Reporting Bank should also observe the guidelines set out in paragraph 2.4 of Annex 10D. 
1026 
A Reporting Bank should also observe the guidelines set out in paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 of Annex 10D. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-42 
5.29 
A Reporting Bank must inform the Authority whenever there is any significant 
change to the Reporting Bank’s IMS or any policy change to its IRRBB management under 
its ICAAP. 
 
5.30 
A Reporting Bank must include in its ICAAP report the outputs of its IMS, 
including the Reporting Bank’s IRRBB exposures for EVE and NII using the interest rate 
shock scenarios set out in paragraph 5.18 of this Annex. 
 
Supervisory Review 
 
5.31 
For the purposes of the Authority’s supervisory review1027, the Authority may 
require that a Reporting Bank provide any or all of the following information relating to 
the Reporting Bank’s IRRBB and the Reporting Bank must provide that information: 
 
(a) 
the modelling of NMDs under the Reporting Bank’s IMS and the sensitivity 
of the Reporting Bank’s economic value and earnings to changes in NMD 
assumptions; 
 
(b) 
the impact of assumptions used regarding products with behavioural 
options; 
 
(c) 
the treatment of own equity in internal calculations and the extent to 
which this impacts the ∆EVE number disclosed under Part XI; 
 
(d) 
repricing gaps of cash flows associated with its interest rate-sensitive 
assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items (by significant currencies); 
 
(e) 
exposures to automatic interest rate options; 
 
(f) 
the types of yield curve used for IMS purposes; 
 
(g) 
the level of ∆EVE if calculated using the SA(IR) set out in Annex 10B; 
 
(h) 
economic value and earnings-based measures for interest rate shock and 
stress scenarios in addition to those prescribed in Annex 10C (including 
results based on the Reporting Bank’s internally developed or other 
interest rate shock or stress scenarios). 
 
5.32 
A Reporting Bank that has been identified as an outlier Reporting Bank by the 
Authority in accordance with paragraph 5.33 of this Annex will be subject to further review 
by the Authority on the Reporting Bank’s management of IRRBB and adequacy of capital 
relative to the Reporting Bank’s IRRBB exposures. 
 
5.33 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.32 of this Annex, an outlier Reporting Bank is 
a Reporting Bank whose maximum ∆EVE across the 6 interest rate shock scenarios set out 
in Annex 10C, calculated in accordance with paragraph 5.34 of this Annex, is more than 
15% of the Reporting Bank’s Tier 1 capital. 
 
 
1027 
In its supervisory review, the Authority would consider the matters listed under paragraphs 31.74 to 31.79 
of the “SRP 31 – Interest rate risk in the banking book” issued by the BCBS in December 2019. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-43 
5.34 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.33 of this Annex, disclosure in Table 11-49 and 
reporting in Schedule 5-1A, a Reporting Bank must calculate its ∆EVE under each of the 6 
interest rate shock scenarios set out in Annex 10C on the following bases: 
 
(a) 
exclude its own equity; 
 
(b) 
include all cash flows arising from all interest rate-sensitive assets (i.e. 
assets which are not deducted from CET 1 Capital, and which exclude fixed 
assets1028 and equity exposures in its banking book), liabilities and off-
balance sheet items in its banking book, calculated in accordance with 
paragraph 5.35 of this Annex; 
 
(c) 
subject to paragraph 5.36 of this Annex, discount cash flows using – 
 
(i) 
a risk-free rate; or 
 
(ii) 
where the Reporting Bank has included commercial margins and 
other spread components in its cash flows, a risk-free rate including 
such commercial margins and other spread components; 
 
(d) 
assume a run-off balance sheet (i.e. where existing banking book positions 
amortise and are not replaced by any new business). 
 
5.35 
For the purposes of calculating cash flows pursuant to paragraph 5.34(b) of this 
Annex – 
 
(a) 
in the case of instruments that reference market interest rates and have 
embedded automatic interest rate caps or embedded automatic interest 
rate floors, a Reporting Bank that does not adopt the methodology set out 
in paragraph 2.13 of Annex 10B as part of its IMS must – 
 
(i) 
apply the automatic interest rate caps or automatic interest rate 
floors in line with the contractual terms of each instrument; and 
 
(ii) 
ensure that each interest rate applied pursuant to sub-paragraph 
(a)(i) is subject to the interest rate floor specified in paragraph 8 of 
Annex 10C; 
 
(b) 
in the case of instruments that reference interest rates that are 
administered or managed by a Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank – 
 
(i) 
may apply interest rate caps, interest rate floors, and assumptions 
on how such interest rates might change in response to interest rate 
shocks, provided that these interest rate caps, interest rate floors 
and assumptions are approved by the Board or its delegates, and are 
clearly documented; 
 
(ii) 
where the Reporting Bank adopts the approach set out in sub-
paragraph (b)(i), the Reporting Bank must ensure that each interest 
 
1028 
For example, real estate or intangible assets.

10-44 
rate applied pursuant to sub-paragraph (b)(i) is subject to the 
interest rate floor specified in paragraph 8 of Annex 10C; and 
 
(iii) where the Reporting Bank does not adopt the approach in sub-
paragraph (b)(i), the Reporting Bank must apply the interest rate 
floor specified in paragraph 8 of Annex 10C; and 
 
(c) 
in the case of all other instruments, a Reporting Bank must apply the 
interest rate floor specified in paragraph 8 of Annex 10C. To avoid doubt, 
the Reporting Bank must not apply any other interest rate cap or interest 
rate floor on the post-shock interest rates used to calculate cash flows. 
 
5.36 
For the purposes of discounting cash flows pursuant to paragraph 5.34(c) of 
this Annex, the Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
ensure that the risk-free rate used for discounting purposes is 
representative of a risk-free zero coupon rate1029; and 
 
(b) 
apply the interest rate floor specified in paragraph 8 of Annex 10C. To 
avoid doubt, the Reporting Bank must not apply any other cap or floor to 
the post-shock interest rates that are used to discount cash flows. 
 
5.37 
For the purposes of disclosure in Table 11-49 and reporting in Schedule 5-1A, 
a Reporting Bank must calculate its ∆NII under the interest rate shock scenarios set out 
in paragraph 2(a) and (b) of Annex 10C on the following bases: 
 
(a) 
include cash flows (including commercial margins and other spread 
components) arising from all interest rate-sensitive assets (i.e. assets 
which are not deducted from CET1 Capital and which exclude fixed 
assets1030 and equity exposures in its banking book), liabilities and off-
balance sheet items in its banking book, calculated in accordance with 
paragraph 5.38 of this Annex; 
 
(b) 
assume a constant balance sheet (i.e. where maturing or repricing cash 
flows are replaced by new cash flows with identical features with regard 
to the amount, repricing period and spread components); 
 
(c) 
subtract NII over the next 12-month period under the interest rate shock 
scenarios set out in paragraph 2(a) and (b) of Annex 10C from NII over 
the next 12-month period under the current interest rates. 
 
5.38 
For the purposes of calculating cash flows pursuant to paragraph 5.37(a) of this 
Annex – 
 
(a) 
in the case of instruments that reference market interest rates and have 
embedded automatic interest rate caps or embedded automatic interest 
rate floors, a Reporting Bank must – 
 
 
1029 
An example of an acceptable yield curve is a secured interest rate swap curve. 
1030 
For example, real estate or intangible assets. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-45 
(i) 
apply the automatic interest rate caps or automatic interest rate 
floors in line with the contractual terms of each instrument; and 
 
(ii) 
ensure that each interest rate applied pursuant to sub-paragraph 
(a)(i) is subject to the interest rate floor specified in paragraph 8 of 
Annex 10C; 
 
(b) 
in the case of instruments that reference interest rates that are 
administered or managed by a Reporting Bank, the Reporting Bank – 
 
(i) 
may apply interest rate caps, interest rate floors, and assumptions 
on how such interest rates might change in response to interest rate 
shocks, provided that these interest rate caps, interest rate floors 
and assumptions are approved by the Board or its delegates, and are 
clearly documented; 
 
(ii) 
where the Reporting Bank adopts the approach set out in sub-
paragraph (b)(i), the Reporting Bank must ensure that each interest 
rate applied pursuant to sub-paragraph (b)(i) is subject to the 
interest rate floor specified in paragraph 8 of Annex 10C; and 
 
(iii) where the Reporting Bank does not adopt the approach in sub-
paragraph (b)(i), the Reporting Bank must apply the interest rate 
floor specified in paragraph 8 of Annex 10C; and 
 
(c) 
in the case of all other instruments, a Reporting Bank must apply the 
interest rate floor specified in paragraph 8 of Annex 10C. To avoid doubt, 
the Reporting Bank must not apply any other interest rate cap or interest 
rate floor on the post-shock interest rates used to calculate cash flows. 
 
5.39 
Where the Authority is of the view that a Reporting Bank’s management of 
IRRBB is inadequate or that the Reporting Bank has excessive IRRBB1031 relative to its 
capital or earnings, or its general risk profile, the Authority may require the Reporting 
Bank to take one or more of the following actions, within a specified time frame1032: 
 
(a) 
reduce its IRRBB exposures1033; 
 
(b) 
raise additional capital; 
 
(c) 
set constraints on the internal risk parameters related to IRRBB used by 
the Reporting Bank; 
 
(d) 
improve its IRRBB management framework. 
 
 
1031 
In making this determination, the Authority may consider other factors than the outlier threshold set out 
in paragraph 5.33 of this Annex. This could include the case where a Reporting Bank’s shocked ∆NII is such 
that the Reporting Bank may not have sufficient income to maintain its normal business conditions. 
1032 
In imposing this time frame, the Authority may consider factors such as the prevailing financial and 
economic conditions, as well as the causes that led to a Reporting Bank’s IRRBB exceeding the supervisory 
threshold. 
1033 
For example, by hedging. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-46 
5.40 
Where the Authority determines that a Reporting Bank’s IMS is deficient in its 
measurement of IRRBB, the Authority may require the Reporting Bank to improve its IMS 
or use the SA(IR) set out in Annex 10B to compute its ∆EVE. 
 
 
Section 6: Operational Risk 
 
6.1 
In assessing its capital adequacy for operational risk, the Reporting Bank must 
consider factors that may not have been adequately assessed under the Pillar 1 
process1034. 
 
 
Operational Risk Management 
 
6.2 
A Reporting Bank must have a comprehensive operational risk management 
framework which applies across its banking group and forms an integral part of its overall 
risk management process. The Reporting Bank must ensure that its operational risk 
management framework – 
 
(a) 
sets out the appetite and tolerance for operational risk of the Reporting 
Bank, which is specified in the Reporting Bank’s policies for managing 
operational risk; and 
 
(b) 
includes the extent and manner in which operational risk of the Reporting 
Bank is impacted by activities including outsourcing.1035  
 
6.3 
A Reporting Bank must set out clearly the policies and procedures of the 
Reporting Bank for the identification, assessment, monitoring, and control and mitigation 
of operational risk inherent in all material products, activities, processes and systems, in 
its operational risk management framework1036. 
 
6.4 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management consistently 
implements the operational risk management framework throughout the organisation and 
allocates adequate resources to the risk management function. A Reporting Bank must 
continually monitor operational risk exposures and report significant operational risk 
concerns to the Board. A Reporting Bank must conduct regular independent reviews of its 
operational risk management framework and risk assessment processes. 
 
6.5 
A Reporting Bank must have in place appropriate reporting mechanisms to keep 
the Authority apprised of developments affecting the operational risk profile of the 
Reporting Bank. 
 
 
1034 
For further guidance, a Reporting Bank should refer to “Principles for the Sound Management of Operational 
Risk” issued by the BCBS in June 2011, “Review of the Principles for the Sound Management of Operational 
Risk” issued by the BCBS in October 2014, “Revisions to the Principles for the Sound Management of 
Operational Risk” issued by the BCBS in March 2021, and any other relevant publications issued by the 
BCBS and the Authority in this area. 
1035 
A Reporting Bank should ensure that the Board and senior management is familiar with the major aspects 
of the operational risk of the Reporting Bank, and is responsible for the effective implementation of the 
operational risk management framework, including the approval and regular review of the risk management 
framework. 
1036 
A Reporting Bank should report any deviation from the established policies to senior management or the 
Board, as appropriate. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-47 
 
Operational Risk Measurement 
 
6.6 
A Reporting Bank must review the capital computed and assess if the amount 
of capital computed is consistent with its operational risk exposure.1037 
 
 
Section 7: Liquidity Risk1038 
 
7.1 
A Reporting Bank must adopt sound liquidity risk management practices that 
are commensurate with its size and sophistication, and with the risk and complexity of its 
activities. 1039 A Reporting Bank must manage its liquidity risk and maintain sufficient 
liquidity to withstand a range of stress events and to weather prolonged periods of financial 
market stress and illiquidity. A Reporting Bank must consider the relationship between 
liquidity and capital since liquidity risk can impact capital adequacy which, in turn, can 
aggravate a Reporting Bank’s liquidity profile.1040 A Reporting Bank must evaluate its 
capital adequacy taking into account its liquidity profile and the liquidity of the markets in 
which it operates. For any size or scope of operation, the liquidity risk management 
framework of a Reporting Bank must cover, at a minimum, the following elements: 
 
(a) 
a Reporting Bank must have in place a liquidity strategy which sets out 
specific liquidity management policies, including the composition of assets 
and liabilities, the approach to managing liquidity across currencies and 
locations, the use of specific financial instruments and the liquidity and 
marketability of assets. A Reporting Bank must ensure that its policies and 
processes for managing liquidity include the consideration of how other 
risks1041 impact the Reporting Banks’ overall liquidity strategy; 
 
(b) 
a Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board approves the strategy and 
significant policies related to the management of liquidity risk. A Reporting 
Bank must also ensure that the Board determines the risk appetite of the 
Reporting Bank for liquidity risk that is communicated throughout the 
Reporting Bank and is reflected in the strategy and policies that are set to 
manage liquidity risk. A Reporting Bank must ensure that senior 
management takes the necessary steps to monitor and control liquidity 
risk, including putting in place appropriate policies and procedures, and 
setting and reviewing limits on the size of liquidity positions over particular 
time horizons. A Reporting Bank must inform the Board regularly of the 
liquidity situation of the Reporting Bank. A Reporting Bank must also 
inform the Board immediately of any material changes in the current or 
prospective liquidity position of the Reporting Bank; 
 
 
1037 
When assessing the measurement of operational risk in the ICAAP of a Reporting Bank, the Authority may 
require a Reporting Bank to apply additional margins of conservatism if the Authority is of the view that 
the data series of the Reporting Bank is insufficient, or that the credibility of the operational risk capital 
requirement is lacking in relation to the Reporting Bank’s peers. 
1038 
For further guidance, a Reporting Bank should refer to “SRP 50 – Liquidity monitoring metrics” issued by 
the BCBS in December 2019, “Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision” issued by 
the BCBS in September 2008, and any other relevant publications issued by the BCBS and the Authority in 
this area. 
1039 
Liquidity is crucial to the ongoing viability of any banking organisation. 
1040 
A Reporting Bank’s capital position can have an effect on its ability to obtain liquidity, especially in a crisis. 
1041 
For example, credit, market, operational and reputation risk. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-48 
(c) 
a Reporting Bank must have adequate information systems for measuring, 
monitoring, controlling and reporting liquidity risk, including liquidity risks 
from complex products and contingent commitments. A Reporting Bank 
must provide reports on a timely basis to the Board, senior management 
and other appropriate personnel. A Reporting Bank must utilise early 
warning indicators to identify the emergence of increased risk or 
vulnerabilities in its liquidity position or funding needs. A Reporting Bank 
must be able to control liquidity risk exposure and funding needs, within 
and across legal entities, business lines and currencies, taking into account 
any legal, regulatory and operational limitations to transferability of 
liquidity. A Reporting Bank’s management of intraday liquidity risk must 
be considered as a crucial part of liquidity risk management. A Reporting 
Bank must also be able to calculate and manage its collateral positions. A 
Reporting Bank must also appropriately price the costs, benefits and risks 
of liquidity into the internal pricing, performance measurement and new 
product approval process of all significant business activities; 
 
(d) 
a Reporting Bank must conduct analyses of net funding requirements 
under alternative scenarios. A Reporting Bank must review the 
assumptions utilised in managing liquidity frequently to determine 
whether they continue to be valid; 
 
(e) 
a Reporting Bank must ensure a diversification of both the tenor and 
sources of funding to manage its liquidity risk. In this respect, a Reporting 
Bank must examine the level of reliance on particular sources, nature of 
the provider of funds and geographic market, and periodically review its 
efforts to establish and maintain relationships with liability holders to 
maintain the diversification of liabilities as well as ensure that it is able to 
sell its assets; 
 
(f) 
a Reporting Bank must have contingency plans that address the strategy 
for handling liquidity crises and include procedures for making up cash 
flow shortfalls in emergency situations; 
 
(g) 
a Reporting Bank must measure, monitor and control its liquidity positions 
in the major currencies in which it is active. In addition to assessing its 
aggregate foreign currency liquidity needs and the acceptable mismatch 
in combination with its domestic currency commitments, a Reporting Bank 
must also undertake separate analysis of its strategy for each currency 
individually. Where appropriate, a Reporting Bank must set and regularly 
review limits on the size of its cash flow mismatches over particular time 
horizons for foreign currencies in aggregate and for each significant 
individual currency in which it operates;  
 
(h) 
a Reporting Bank must perform stress tests or scenario analyses on a 
regular basis in order to identify and quantify its exposures to possible 
future liquidity stresses, analysing possible impacts on the Reporting 
Bank’s cash flows, currency mismatches, liquidity positions, profitability, 
and solvency. A Reporting Bank must include a variety of short-term and 
protracted bank-specific and market-wide liquidity stress scenarios 
(individually and in combination). A Reporting must use conservative 
assumptions in its stress test scenarios and regularly review the 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-49 
assumptions. The Reporting Bank must ensure that senior management 
discusses the results of these stress tests, and take remedial or mitigating 
actions to limit the Reporting Bank’s exposures, build up a liquidity 
cushion, and adjust its liquidity profile to fit its risk tolerance. The 
Reporting Bank must use the results of these stress tests to shape the 
Reporting Bank’s contingency funding plans; 
 
(i) 
a Reporting Bank must have adequate internal controls that involve 
regular independent reviews and evaluation of the effectiveness of its 
liquidity risk management process to ensure its integrity and that 
appropriate revisions or enhancements to internal controls are made 
where necessary. 
 
7.2 
A Reporting Bank must consider the extent of its liquidity risk in its assessment 
of capital adequacy and, where appropriate, set aside additional capital to address such 
risk. 
 
 
Section 8: Reputational Risk  
 
8.1 
Reputational risk is the risk arising from negative perception on the part of 
customers, counterparties, shareholders, investors, debt-holders, market analysts, other 
relevant parties or regulators that can adversely affect a Reporting Bank’s ability to 
maintain existing, or establish new, business relationships and continued access to sources 
of funding 1042. Furthermore, it exists throughout a Reporting Bank and exposure to 
reputational risk is essentially a function of the adequacy of the Reporting Bank’s internal 
risk management processes, as well as the manner and efficiency with which the Reporting 
Bank’s management responds to external influences on bank-related transactions. 
 
8.2 
A Reporting Bank must identify potential sources of reputational risk to which 
it is exposed. These include the Reporting Bank’s business lines, liabilities, off-balance 
sheet vehicles, the operations of its affiliates, and the markets in which the banking group 
operates. A Reporting Bank must also have appropriate policies in place to identify sources 
of reputational risk, and to consider such risks in the approval processes for entering new 
markets, products, lines of activities or strategic initiatives. A Reporting Bank must 
incorporate risks that arise from reputational risk into its risk management processes and 
appropriately address these risks in its ICAAP and liquidity contingency plans.1043 In the 
 
1042 
For example, through the interbank or securitisation markets. 
1043 
Reputational risk may in turn give rise to credit, liquidity, market and legal risks, all of which can have a 
negative impact on a Reporting Bank’s earnings, liquidity and capital position. For example –  
(a) reputational risk may arise from a Reporting Bank’s involvement in asset management. In the event 
that the financial instruments issued, managed or distributed by the Reporting Bank are not correctly 
priced or the main risk drivers not adequately disclosed, the Reporting Bank may feel some 
responsibility to its customers, or be economically compelled, to cover any losses or to support the 
value of shares or units held by investors even though it is not contractually required to provide the 
support; 
(b) reputational risk may lead to the provision of implicit support of securitisations, which arises when a 
Reporting Bank provides post-sale support to a securitisation transaction in excess of any contractual 
obligation. Such non-contractual support exposes the Reporting Bank to the risk of loss, such as loss 
arising from deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying assets of the securitisation; or 
(c) reputational risk may affect a Reporting Bank’s liabilities, since market confidence and the Reporting 
Bank’s ability to fund its business are closely related to its reputation. A Reporting Bank may call its 
liabilities, in particular, liabilities that are components of regulatory capital, even though this might 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-50 
case of securitisation or off-balance sheet vehicles that could give rise to reputational risk, 
a Reporting Bank must assess whether the requirements under the securitisation 
framework have been met and the potential adverse impact of providing implicit support. 
 
8.3 
Where appropriate, a Reporting Bank must also identify potential exposures 
arising from reputational concerns and evaluate the amount of support it might have to 
provide (including implicit support for securitisations) or losses it might experience in 
adverse market conditions. In particular, in order to evaluate the potential impact of 
actions taken to avoid reputational damage and to maintain market confidence, a 
Reporting Bank must develop methodologies to measure, to the extent possible, the effect 
of reputational risk in terms of other risk types1044 to which it may be exposed.1045 
 
 
Section 9: Other Risk Categories 
 
9.1 
The risk categories set out in this Annex are not exhaustive. A Reporting Bank 
must have in place a rigorous process for determining the adequacy of its capital to support 
all risks to which it is exposed, and must manage all risks to which it is exposed, including 
those that are not easily quantifiable. 
 
 
Section 10: Stress Testing Practices1046 
 
10.1 
A Reporting Bank must incorporate rigorous, forward-looking stress testing1047 
that identifies a range of possible events or changes in market conditions that could 
adversely impact the Reporting Bank in its capital planning process. A Reporting Bank 
must ensure that the sophistication of techniques and stress tests used are commensurate 
with the Reporting Bank’s activities. A Reporting Bank, under its ICAAP, must perform a 
careful analysis of its capital instruments and their potential performance during times of 
stress, including their ability to absorb losses and support ongoing business operations. A 
Reporting Bank must also examine its future capital resources and capital requirements 
under adverse scenarios. In particular, a Reporting Bank must consider the results of 
forward-looking stress testing when evaluating the adequacy of the Reporting Bank’s 
 
negatively affect its liquidity profile, to avoid damaging its reputation. In such cases, the Reporting 
Bank’s capital position is likely to suffer. 
1044 
For example, credit, liquidity, market or operational risk. 
1045 
A Reporting Bank should include reputational risk scenarios in regular stress tests, for example, by including 
non-contractual off-balance sheet exposures in the stress tests to determine the effect on a Reporting 
Bank’s credit, market and liquidity risk profiles. A Reporting Bank may adopt methodologies, such as 
comparing the actual amount of exposure carried on the balance sheet versus the maximum amount of 
exposure held off-balance sheet, that is, the potential amount to which the Reporting Bank could be 
exposed. A Reporting Bank should also pay particular attention to the effects of reputational risk on its 
overall liquidity position, taking into account both possible increases in the asset side of the balance sheet 
and possible restrictions on funding, should the loss of reputation result in various counterparties’ loss of 
confidence. 
1046 
For further guidance, a Reporting Bank should refer to “Stress testing principles” issued by the BCBS in 
October 2018, and any other relevant publications issued by the BCBS and the Authority in this area. 
1047 
Stress testing is an important tool that can be used as part of a Reporting Bank’s internal risk management 
that alerts its senior management to adverse unexpected outcomes related to a broad variety of risks, and 
provides an indication of how much capital might be needed to absorb losses should large shocks occur. 
Moreover, stress testing provides a complementary risk perspective and supplements other risk 
management approaches and measures so that the senior management of the Reporting Bank may have 
a more complete understanding of the Reporting Bank’s risks and the interaction of those risks under 
stressed conditions. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-51 
capital buffer. A Reporting Bank must also consider scenarios to assess risks associated 
with securitisation, where appropriate1048. 
 
10.2 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that it has sufficient capital to meet the 
regulatory capital requirements under Pillar 1 and to cover the results of its credit stress 
tests performed under the requirement in paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2 of Annex 7X1049. To the 
extent that this is not met, the Authority will take appropriate action, which may include 
instructing the Reporting Bank to take action to lower the risks which it assumes or 
maintain additional capital or provisions, or both, so that existing capital resources can 
cover the Pillar 1 capital requirements plus the results of a recalculated stress test.  
 
 
 
1048 
A Reporting Bank should consider pipeline and warehoused exposures in its risk management processes 
and in its stress tests, regardless of the probability of securitising the exposures. It should consider 
scenarios that may prevent it from securitising the exposures, and the potential effect on its liquidity, 
earnings and capital adequacy. A Reporting Bank should also consider whether it would provide support to 
securitisation structures in stressed scenarios, due to its reliance on securitisation as a funding tool. 
1049 
The Authority may review how the stress test was carried out. The results of the stress test contribute 
directly to the expectation that a Reporting Bank will operate above the Pillar 1 regulatory capital ratios.

Annex 10B 
 
STANDARDISED APPROACH FOR INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK 
(SA(IR)) 
 
 
Section 1: Overview 
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank must carry out the following steps to measure its IRRBB under 
SA(IR), based solely on the EVE: 
 
(a) 
Step 1: Allocate interest rate-sensitive positions in the banking book set 
out in paragraph 2.2 of this Annex to one of the following 3 categories: 
 
(i) 
amenable to standardisation; 
 
(ii) 
less amenable to standardisation; or 
 
(iii) not amenable to standardisation; 
 
(b) 
Step 2: Slot cash flows arising from interest rate-sensitive positions in the 
banking book set out in paragraph 2.2 of this Annex that are amenable to 
standardisation based on their repricing maturities using the approach set 
out in paragraphs 2.8 to 2.12 of this Annex. The Reporting Bank must 
exclude cash flows arising from positions less amenable to standardisation 
from this step. The Reporting Bank must ignore the optionality of positions 
with embedded automatic interest rate options for the purposes of slotting 
of notional repricing cash flows (i.e. the Reporting Bank must ensure that 
a position in an embedded automatic interest rate option is stripped out 
from the process of slotting notional repricing cash flows set out in this 
sub-paragraph, and is treated together with other automatic interest rate 
options as set out in sub-paragraph (c)). The Reporting Bank must slot 
cash flows arising from positions that are not amenable to standardisation 
using the approaches set out in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.10 of this Annex for 
NMDs and paragraphs 4.1 to 4.11 of this Annex for behavioural options 
respectively; 
 
(c) 
Step 3: Determine the ∆EVE for the relevant interest rate scenarios for 
each currency, where ∆EVE is measured per currency for all 6 interest rate 
scenarios in accordance with paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2 of this Annex. In 
doing so, the Reporting Bank must include the add-ons for changes in the 
value of automatic interest rate options (whether explicit or embedded), 
calculated using the approach in paragraphs 5.1 to 5.5 of this Annex, 
under each interest rate scenario on a per currency basis; 
 
(d) 
Step 4: Calculate the ∆EVE under SA(IR) as the maximum of the worst 
aggregated reductions to EVE across the 6 supervisory interest rate shocks 
as set out in paragraph 6.3 of this Annex. 
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore

Section 2: Components of SA(IR) 
 
Cash Flow Bucketing 
 
2.1 
A Reporting Bank must project all future notional repricing cash flows arising 
from the interest rate-sensitive positions in the banking book onto – 
 
(a) 
the time buckets as set out in Table 10B-1 according to their repricing 
dates; or 
 
(b) 
the time bucket midpoints as set out in Table 10B-1, by splitting the 
notional repricing cash flows between 2 adjacent time bucket midpoints 
while retaining the notional repricing cash flows’ weighted average 
maturity (weighted by the magnitude of the cash flows in each time bucket 
midpoint)1050. 
 
2.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 2.1 of this Annex, interest rate-sensitive 
positions in the banking book are – 
 
(a) 
assets, excluding assets which are deducted from CET1 Capital, fixed 
assets1051, and equity exposures in the banking book; 
 
(b) 
liabilities, including all non-remunerated deposits; and 
 
(c) 
off-balance sheet items. 
 
To avoid doubt, a Reporting Bank must exclude CET1 Capital from interest rate-sensitive 
positions. 
 
2.3 
For the purposes of this Annex – 
 
(a) 
“time bucket” means any one of the time buckets set out in Table 10B-1; 
 
(b) 
“time bucket midpoint” means any one of the time bucket midpoints set 
out in Table 10B-1; 
 
(c) 
“notional repricing cash flow” means – 
 
(i) 
repayment of principal or part of it, at any time; 
 
(ii) 
any repricing of principal where repricing is said to occur at the 
earliest date at which the Reporting Bank or its counterparty is 
entitled to unilaterally change the interest rate, or at which the rate 
on a floating rate instrument changes automatically in response to a 
change in an external benchmark; or 
 
 
1050 
For example, for a notional repricing cash flow of $100 with a maturity of 3Y, a Reporting Bank must split 
the cash flow into the adjacent time bucket midpoints of 2.5Y and 3.5Y. An amount of $50 is to be allocated 
to the time bucket midpoint of 2.5Y and the remaining $50 to the time bucket midpoint of 3.5Y, to retain 
the weighted average maturity of 3Y. 
1051

(iii) any interest payment on a tranche of principal that has not yet been 
repaid or repriced; and 
 
(d) 
“repricing date” means the date of each repayment, repricing or interest 
payment. 
 
2.4 
A Reporting Bank may choose whether to deduct commercial margins and other 
spread components from the notional repricing cash flows, using a prudent and 
transparent methodology. 
 
2.5 
Where a Reporting Bank has chosen not to deduct commercial margins and 
other spread components of interest payments from the notional repricing cash flows, the 
Reporting Bank must slot the commercial margins and other spread components of interest 
payments on a tranche of principal that has not yet been repaid and which do not reprice 
until their contractual maturity, irrespective of whether the non-amortised principal has 
been repriced or not.

Process for Slotting and Decomposing Banking Book Instruments 
 
2.6 
Paragraphs 2.8 to 2.14 of this Annex set out the process for slotting and 
decomposing banking book instruments for – 
 
(a) 
fixed rate positions or floating rate positions that are amenable to 
standardisation, including positions with embedded automatic interest 
rate options; 
 
(b) 
positions that are less amenable to standardisation; and 
 
(c) 
positions that are not amenable to standardisation. 
 
2.7 
For the purposes of this Annex – 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-55 
(a) 
“fixed rate positions” mean positions which generate cash flows that are 
certain till the point of contractual maturity1052; and 
 
(b) 
“floating rate positions” mean positions which generate cash flows that are 
not predictable past the next repricing date other than that the present 
value would be reset to par. 
 
Process for Positions that are Amenable to Standardisation 
 
2.8 
The Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
in respect of fixed rate positions, allocate repricing cash flows either to 
time buckets or time bucket midpoints based on contractual maturity of 
such cash flows; and 
 
(b) 
in respect of floating rate positions, treat such positions as a series of 
coupon payments until the next repricing and a par notional cash flow at 
the time bucket or time bucket midpoints closest to the next reset date, 
with no additional slotting of notional repricing cash flows to later time 
buckets or time bucket midpoints (other than the spread component which 
is not repriced). 
 
2.9 
Where a Reporting Bank allocates repricing cash flows based on time bucket 
midpoints for fixed rate positions, the Reporting Bank must allocate, all coupon cash flows 
and periodic or final principal repayments to the 2 adjacent time bucket midpoints closest 
to the contractual maturity. 
 
2.10 
Where a Reporting Bank allocates repricing cash flows based on time buckets 
midpoints for floating rate positions, the Reporting Bank must allocate all coupon and 
notional repricing cash flows to the 2 adjacent time bucket midpoints closest to the next 
reset date. 
 
2.11 
A Reporting Bank must ignore the optionality (whether sold or bought) arising 
from positions with embedded automatic interest rate options for the purposes of slotting 
notional repricing cash flows1053 under paragraph 2.8 of this Annex, and must treat the 
stripped-out embedded automatic interest rate options as if they are explicit automatic 
interest rate options. 
 
2.12 
A Reporting Bank may, with the Authority’s approval, categorise other positions 
as being amenable to standardisation and ignore any optionality associated with such 
positions if the Reporting Bank can demonstrate that such optionality is of immaterial 
consequence. 
 
 
1052 
For example, fixed rate loans without embedded prepayment options, term deposits without redemption 
risk or other amortising products such as mortgage loans. 
1053 
For example, a Reporting Bank must treat a floating rate mortgage loan or debt security with embedded 
interest rate caps and/or floors as if there were no interest rate cap and/or floor (i.e. as if it was a fixed 
rate loan until the next repricing date, where it would be fully repriced), and slot its full outstanding balance 
into the corresponding time band. Similarly, a Reporting Bank must treat a callable bond issued by a 
Reporting Bank at a fixed yield as if it matured at its longest contractual term, ignoring the call option. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-56 
Process for Positions that are Less Amenable to Standardisation1054 
 
2.13 
A Reporting Bank must use the methodology provided in paragraphs 5.1 to 5.5 
of this Annex to treat explicit automatic interest rate options and embedded automatic 
interest rate options that are separated or stripped out from the Reporting Bank’s assets 
or liabilities. 
 
Process for Positions that are Not Amenable to Standardisation 
 
2.14 
A Reporting Bank must use the methodology provided in paragraphs 3.1 to 4.11 
of this Annex for positions not amenable to standardisation. Positions not amenable to 
standardisation include – 
 
(a) 
NMDs; 
 
(b) 
fixed rate loans subject to prepayment risk; and 
 
(c) 
term deposits subject to early redemption risk. 
 
 
Section 3: Treatment of NMDs 
 
3.1 
A Reporting Bank must carry out the following steps in the order set out below 
for the treatment of NMDs: 
 
(a) 
segment its NMDs according to the nature of the deposit and depositor in 
accordance with paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 of this Annex; 
 
(b) 
identify, for each NMD category, the core and non-core deposits in 
accordance with paragraphs 3.6 and 3.7 of this Annex, up to the caps on 
proportion of core deposits specified in Table 10B-2; 
 
(c) 
determine an appropriate cash flow slotting for each NMD category in 
accordance with paragraphs 3.8 to 3.10 of this Annex and the average 
maturity limits specified in Table 10B-2. 
 
NMD Categories 
 
3.2 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
segment NMDs into – 
 
(i) 
retail (transactional) NMDs; 
 
(ii) 
retail (non-transactional) NMDs; and 
 
(iii) wholesale NMDs; 
 
 
1054 
For positions that are less amenable to standardisation, a common feature is optionality that makes the 
timing of notional repricing cash flows uncertain. Such optionality introduces a non-linearity, which suggests 
that delta-equivalent approximations are imprecise for large interest rate shock scenarios. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-57 
(b) 
treat deposits placed with it by an individual as retail deposits, and subject 
to sub-paragraph (c), deposits from legal entities, sole proprietorships or 
partnerships as wholesale deposits; 
 
(c) 
treat deposits made by small business customers as retail deposits; 
 
(d) 
where regular transactions are carried out of the account of an individual 
or small business customer, classify such retail deposits as being held in 
a transactional account1055; and 
 
(e) 
classify all other retail deposits as being held in a non-transactional 
account. 
 
3.3 
A Reporting Bank may further segment its retail (transactional) NMDs referred 
to in paragraph 3.2(a)(i) of this Annex into retail (transactional, remunerated) NMDs and 
retail (transactional, non-remunerated) NMDs, subject to the Authority’s approval. 
 
3.4 
For the purposes of paragraph 3.2(c) and (d) of this Annex and subject to 
paragraph 3.5 of this Annex, “small business customer” means any customer or group of 
customers – 
 
(a) 
that is a small business; 
 
(b) 
that the Reporting Bank does not have any exposure to, or that the 
Reporting Bank has exposures of not more than S$2 million; 
 
(c) 
where the funding provided by the customer or group of customers is not 
more than S$2 million; and 
 
(d) 
where the exposures to the customer or group of customers are managed 
by the Reporting Bank as retail exposures, or where the Reporting Bank 
does not have any exposure to the customer or group of customers, the 
funding provided by the customer or group of customers is managed by 
the Reporting Bank as retail deposits. 
 
3.5 
For the purposes of the definition of “small business customer” in paragraph 3.4 
of this Annex – 
 
(a) 
in determining the total exposures to, or total funding provided by, a group 
of customers, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the basis of 
aggregation of a group of customers follows the basis of aggregation set 
out in paragraph 7.3.16; 
 
(b) 
an exposure is managed by the Reporting Bank as a retail exposure if the 
exposure is originated in the same manner as other retail exposures, and 
is managed by the Reporting Bank as part of a pool of similar exposures 
in its internal risk management systems consistently over time and in the 
same manner as other retail exposures; and 
 
 
1055 
Examples of transactional retail deposits are ones where salaries are automatically credited or where the 
deposit is non-interest bearing. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-58 
(c) 
a funding is managed by the Reporting Bank as retail deposits if the 
funding is originated in the same manner as other retail deposits, and is 
managed by the Reporting Bank as part of a pool of similar deposits in its 
internal risk management systems consistently over time and in the same 
manner as other retail deposits. 
 
Separation of NMDs 
 
3.6 
A Reporting Bank must distinguish between the stable and non-stable parts of 
each NMD category using observed volume changes over the past 10 years. The stable 
NMD portion refers to the portion that is found to remain undrawn with a high degree of 
likelihood. 
 
3.7 
A Reporting Bank must estimate its level of core deposits based on the 
proportion of stable NMDs which are unlikely to reprice even under significant changes in 
the interest rate environment and subject to the cap as shown in Table 10B-2 for each 
NMD category. The Reporting Bank must estimate its level of non-core deposits as the 
remainder of NMDs not treated as core deposits. 
 
Cash Flow Slotting 
 
3.8 
A Reporting Bank must slot NMDs into the appropriate time bucket or time 
bucket midpoint. 
 
3.9 
A Reporting Bank must treat the non-core deposits mentioned in paragraph 3.7 
of this Annex as overnight deposits and accordingly slot such non-core deposits into the 
overnight time bucket or overnight time bucket midpoint. 
 
3.10 
A Reporting Bank must determine the appropriate cash flow slotting procedure 
for each category of core deposits, up to the maximum average maturity for each category 
as specified in Table 10B-2.

Section 4: Treatment of Positions with Behavioural Options other than NMDs 
 
4.1 
The treatment set out in paragraphs 4.2 to 4.11 of this Annex applies only to 
behavioural options related to retail customers. In the case where a wholesale customer 
has a behavioural option that may change the pattern of notional repricing cash flows, a 
Reporting Bank must use the methodology provided in paragraph 5.5 of this Annex. 
 
 
 
 
 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-59 
Positions with Behavioural Options other than NMDs 
 
4.2 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the optionality of positions with behavioural 
options other than NMDs1056, by using the formula A x B, where – 
 
(a) 
A is the baseline estimate of loan prepayments and early withdrawal of 
fixed-term deposits given the prevailing term structure of interest rates; 
and 
 
(b) 
B is the scenario-dependent scalar that reflects the likely behavioural 
changes in the exercise of the options. 
 
4.3 
A Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
determine the value of A referred to in paragraph 4.2(a) of this Annex; 
and 
 
(b) 
where the Reporting Bank adopts the SA(IR) under paragraph 5.14(b) of 
Annex 10A, obtain the Authority’s prior approval of the value of A. 
 
Fixed Rate Loans Subject to Prepayment Risk 
 
4.4 
For any loan product where the economic cost of prepayments is never charged, 
or charged only for prepayments above a certain threshold, a Reporting Bank must use 
the steps set out in paragraphs 4.5 to 4.7 of this Annex to assign notional repricing cash 
flows. 
 
4.5 
A Reporting Bank must compute the CPR for each portfolio p of homogeneous 
prepayment-exposed loans denominated in currency c under an interest rate shock 
scenario i as set out in Table 10B-3 as either – 
 
(a) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝= min(1, 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖∙𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶0,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝); 
 
(b) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑘𝑘)𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝= min(1, 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖∙𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑘𝑘)0,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝); or 
 
(c) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘)𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝= min(1, 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖∙𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘)0,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝), 
 
where – 
 
(i) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝 is a constant CPR, while 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑘𝑘)𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝 and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘)𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝 refer to the CPR for 
time bucket k and time bucket midpoint 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘, respectively where the CPR 
varies over the life of each loan in the portfolio; 
 
 
1056 
In the case of fixed rate loans subject to prepayments and term deposits subject to early redemption risk, 
the customer has the option to repay the fixed rate loan early or to withdraw the term deposits before 
maturity, which, if exercised, will alter the timing of a Reporting Bank’s cash flows. The customer’s exercise 
of the option is, among other factors, influenced by changes in interest rates.

(ii) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶0,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝 is a constant baseline CPR, while 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑘𝑘)0,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝 and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘)𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝 refer to the 
CPR for time bucket k and time bucket midpoint 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘, respectively under the 
prevailing term structure of interest rates; and 
 
(iii) 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 is a multiplier applied for scenario i as given in Table 10B-3.

A Reporting Bank must reflect the prepayments on its fixed rate loans in its 
relevant cash flows (i.e. scheduled payments on the loans, prepayments and interest 
payments), by separating such payments into scheduled payments adjusted for 
prepayment and uncompensated prepayments as follows: 
 
(a) 
where time buckets are used – 
 
(i) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑘𝑘) =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑆𝑆(𝑘𝑘) + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝∙𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑘𝑘−1); or 
 
(ii) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑘𝑘) =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑆𝑆(𝑘𝑘) + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑘𝑘)𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝∙𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑘𝑘−1); 
 
(b) 
where time bucket midpoints are used – 
 
(i) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) = 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑆𝑆(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝∙𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘−1); or 
 
(ii) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑆𝑆(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘)𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝∙𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘−1), 
 
where – 
 
(i) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑘𝑘) and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) refer to the notional repricing cashflows arising from 
a portfolio p of homogeneous prepayment-exposed loans denominated in 
currency c under an interest rate shock scenario i as set out in Table 10B-
3; 
 
(ii) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑆𝑆(𝑘𝑘)  and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑆𝑆(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘)  refer to the scheduled interest and principal 
repayment for each interest rate shock scenario i and currency c, adjusted 
to take into account prepayments; 
 
(iii) k and tk refer to the time bucket and time bucket midpoint respectively, 
that the scheduled interest and principal repayment are slotted into; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-61 
(iv) 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑘𝑘−1) and 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘−1) denote the notional outstanding of portfolio p at 
time bucket k-1 and time bucket midpoint tk-1 respectively, for each 
interest rate scenario i and currency c; and 
 
(v) 
the base cash flows (that is given the current interest rate yield curve and 
base CPR) are given by i=0. 
 
4.7 
Where a Reporting Bank has in place annual limits on uncompensated 
prepayments, it must apply these annual limits in the relevant cash flows referred to in 
paragraph 4.6 of this Annex. 
 
Term Deposits Subject to Early Redemption Risk 
 
4.8 
A Reporting Bank must treat term deposits as being subject to early redemption 
risk, subject to paragraph 4.9 of this Annex. 
 
4.9 
A Reporting Bank may treat term deposits as fixed rate liabilities and slot the 
notional repricing cash flows of such deposits into the time buckets or time bucket 
midpoints up to their corresponding contractual maturity dates if the Reporting Bank can 
show to the satisfaction of the Authority that – 
 
(a) 
the depositor has no legal right to withdraw the deposit; or 
 
(b) 
an early withdrawal results in a significant penalty that at least 
compensates for the loss of interest between the date of withdrawal and 
the contractual maturity date and the economic cost of breaking the 
contract1057. 
 
4.10 
A Reporting Bank must compute the TDRR for each portfolio as – 
 
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝= min (1, 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖∙𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇0,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝) 
 
where – 
 
(a) 
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝 is the TDRR that is applicable to each homogeneous portfolio p of 
term deposits in currency c for each interest rate shock scenario i set out 
in Table 10B-4; 
 
(b) 
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇0,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝 is the baseline TDRR under the current interest rate yield curve 
that is applicable to each homogeneous portfolio p of term deposits in 
currency c and is to be determined by the Reporting Bank; and 
 
(c) 
𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 is the scalar multiplier applied for interest rate shock scenario i as given 
in Table 10B-4. 
 
 
1057 
However, penalties often do not reflect such an economic calculation but are instead based on a simpler 
formula such as a percentage of accrued interest. In such cases, there is potential for changes to profit or 
loss arising from differences between the penalty charged and the actual economic cost of early withdrawal.

bucket (k=1) or time bucket midpoint (t1) as follows – 
 
(a) 
where time buckets are used – 
 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(1) = 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇0,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝∙𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡1) = 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇0,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝∙𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝 
 
where – 
 
(i) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(1)  refers to the notional repricing cashflows arising from each 
homogeneous portfolio p of term deposits in currency c for each interest 
rate shock scenario i set out in Table 10B-4, which are expected to be 
redeemed early and slotted into the overnight time bucket; 
 
(ii) 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡1)  refers to the notional repricing cashflows arising from each 
homogeneous portfolio p of term deposits in currency c for each interest 
rate shock scenario i set out in Table 10B-4, which are expected to be 
redeemed early and slotted into the overnight time bucket midpoint; and 
 
(iii) 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇0,𝑐𝑐
𝑝𝑝 refers to the outstanding amount of term deposits for portfolio p and 
currency c. 
 
 
Section 5: Automatic Interest Rate Options 
 
5.1 
A Reporting Bank must calculate an add-on for sold automatic interest rate 
options, whether explicit or embedded1058. A Reporting Bank may calculate an add-on for 
all bought automatic interest rate options or only for bought automatic interest rate options 
used for hedging sold automatic interest rate options. 
 
1058 
The most important interest rate options that are likely to occur in the banking book are caps and floors, 
which are often embedded in banking products. Swaptions, such as prepayment options on non-retail 
products, may also be treated as automatic interest rate options as, in cases where such options are held 
by sophisticated financial market counterparties, the option holder will almost certainly exercise the option 
if it is in the holder’s financial interest to do so. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-63 
 
5.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.1 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must 
calculate the add-on based on the following – 
 
(a) 
for each sold automatic option o in currency c, the value change denoted 
∆𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑜𝑜 is calculated for each interest rate shock scenario i. The value 
change is given by – 
 
(i) 
an estimate of the value of the option to the option holder, given – 
 
(A) a yield curve in currency c under the interest rate shock 
scenario i; and 
 
(B) a relative increase in the implicit volatility of 25%, 
 
minus 
 
(ii) 
the value of the sold option to the option holder, given the yield curve 
in currency c at the valuation date; 
 
(b) 
for each bought automatic interest rate option q in currency c, the 
Reporting Bank must determine the change in value of the option, 
∆𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑞𝑞, between interest rate shock scenario i and the current interest 
rate term structure combined with a relative increase in the implicit 
volatility of 25%; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank’s total measure for automatic interest rate option 
risk, 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐, under interest rate shock scenario i in currency c is calculated 
as – 
 
𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐= ෍∆𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑜𝑜−෍∆𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐
𝑞𝑞
𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐
𝑞𝑞=1
𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐
𝑜𝑜=1
 
 
where 𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 is the number of sold options in currency c, and 𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐 is the number 
of bought options in currency c. 
 
5.3 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.2(a) and (b) of this Annex, the Reporting Bank 
must – 
 
(a) 
calculate the value of the option to the option holder based on an 
internally-selected methodology; and 
 
(b) 
where the Reporting Bank adopts the SA(IR) under paragraph 5.14(b) of 
Annex 10A, obtain the Authority’s prior approval of the methodology. 
 
5.4 
Where a Reporting Bank calculates an add-on only for bought automatic interest 
rate options that are used for hedging sold automatic interest rate options, the Reporting 
Bank must, in respect of remaining bought interest rate options, add any change in market 
value that is reflected in regulatory capital to the total automatic interest rate option risk 
measure 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐.

For the purposes of paragraphs 5.2 to 5.4 of this Annex, the Reporting Bank 
must treat any behavioural option positions with wholesale customers that may change 
the pattern of notional repricing cash flows as embedded automatic interest rate 
options1059. A Reporting Bank may treat wholesale term deposits as fixed rate liabilities 
and slot their notional repricing cashflows into the time buckets or time bucket midpoints 
up to their corresponding contractual maturity dates if the Reporting Bank can 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that – 
 
(a) 
the depositor has no legal right to withdraw the deposit; or 
 
(b) 
an early withdrawal results in a significant penalty that at least 
compensates for the loss of interest between the date of withdrawal and 
the contractual maturity date and the economic cost of breaking the 
contract1060. 
 
 
Section 6: Calculation of the Standardised EVE Measure 
 
6.1 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the loss in economic value of equity, ∆𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐 
under scenario i and currency c for each currency with material exposures, that is, 
currencies that account for more than 5% of its banking book assets or liabilities, as follows: 
 
(a) 
slot all notional repricing cash flows into their respective time buckets 𝑘𝑘∈
{1,2, … , 𝐾𝐾} or time bucket midpoints𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘, 𝑘𝑘∈{1,2, … , 𝐾𝐾} for each scenario i. 
Within a given time bucket k or time bucket midpoint 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘, the Reporting 
Bank must net1061 all positive and negative notional repricing cash flows 
to form a single long or short position, with the netted parts removed from 
the calculation. This process applied across all time buckets or time bucket 
midpoints leads to a set of notional repricing cash flows 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐(𝑘𝑘)  or 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘), 𝑘𝑘∈{1,2, … , 𝐾𝐾}133F1062; 
 
(b) 
weigh the net notional repricing cash flows in each time bucket k or time 
bucket midpoints 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘 calculated in sub-paragraph (a) by 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘)  a 
continuously compounded discount factor – 
 
𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) = exp (−𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) ∙𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) 
 
where – 
 
 
1059 
An example of such an option would be a puttable fixed coupon bond issued by the Reporting Bank in the 
wholesale market, for which the owner has the right to sell the bond back to the Reporting Bank at a fixed 
price at any time. 
1060 
However, penalties often do not reflect such an economic calculation but are instead based on a simpler 
formula such as a percentage of accrued interest. In such cases, there is potential for changes to profit or 
loss arising from differences between the penalty charged and the actual economic cost of early withdrawal. 
1061 
Intra-bucket mismatch risk arises as notional repricing cash flows with different maturity dates, but falling 
within the same time bucket or time bucket midpoint, are assumed to match perfectly. This is mitigated by 
the high number of time buckets available. 
1062 
Depending on the approach the Reporting Bank takes for NMDs, prepayments and products with other 
embedded behavioural options, the notional repricing cash flows may vary by scenario i (scenario-
dependent cash flow products).

A Reporting Bank must ensure that the risk-free rate used for discounting 
purposes is representative of a risk-free zero coupon rate1063. 
 
6.3 
A Reporting Bank must compute the standardised EVE risk measure by 
aggregating the EVE losses ∆𝐸𝐸𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐> 0 under a given interest rate scenario i, and taking 
the maximum loss across all interest rate shock scenarios –

For currencies not specified in Table 10C-1, a Reporting Bank must use the 
following steps to derive their instantaneous interest rate shocks: 
 
(a) 
Step 1: generate a 16-year time series of daily interest rates for the 
currencies not available in Table 10C-1 from the year 2000 (3 January 
2000) to the year 2015 (31 December 2015), or based on such other 
historical period that is approved by the Authority. The Reporting Bank 
must determine the average local percentile of the rate series by 
calculating the average rate across all daily rates in time buckets 3M, 6M, 
1Y, 2Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y, 15Y and 20Y; 
 
(b) 
Step 2: apply the baseline global interest rate shock parameters specified 
in Table 10C-2 to the average long-term rates derived in sub-paragraph 
(a) to obtain the interest rate shocks by currency for the parallel, short 
and long segments of the yield curve; 
 
Table 10C-2: Baseline global interest rate shock parameters 
Parallel 
60% 
Short 
85% 
Long 
40% 
 
(c) 
Step 3: apply the following caps and floors to the interest rate shocks 
derived in sub-paragraph (b) to obtain the final set of instantaneous 
interest rate shocks, 𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜,𝑐𝑐 for each shock type (parallel, short and 
long) and for each currency c: 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-68 
(i) 
parallel – floor of 100bps, cap of 400bps; 
 
(ii) 
short – floor of 100bps, cap of 500bps; 
 
(iii) long – floor of 100bps, cap of 300bps. 
 
5 
Any approval granted under paragraph 4(a) of Annex 10C of MAS Notice 637 in 
force immediately before 1 July 2024 is treated as an approval under paragraph 4(a) of 
this Annex. 
 
6 
A Reporting Bank must maintain relevant documents and proper audit trails for 
the derivation of instantaneous shock rates for currencies not specified in Table 10C-1 to 
facilitate reviews by the Authority. 
 
7 
Subject to paragraph 8 of this Annex, a Reporting Bank must calculate the 
interest rate shocks and apply such shocks to each of the 6 interest rate shock scenarios 
referred to in paragraph 2 of this Annex as follows:

parallel shock for currency c,  ∆𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘), that refers to a constant 
parallel shock up or down across all time buckets – 
 
∆𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) = ±𝑅𝑅ത𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑐𝑐 
 
where – 
 
(i) 
𝑅𝑅ത𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑐𝑐 refers to the instantaneous interest rate shock for currency 
c and the parallel shock type specified in paragraph 3 of this Annex 
or, in the case of currencies not specified in Table 10C-1, paragraph 
4 of this Annex; and 
 
(ii) 
𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘 refers to the midpoint (in time) of the kth bucket; 
 
(b) 
short rate shock for currency c, ∆𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘), that refers to a shock up or 
down that is greatest at the shortest tenor midpoint – 
 
∆𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) = ±𝑅𝑅ത𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜,𝑐𝑐∙𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) = ±𝑅𝑅ത𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜,𝑐𝑐∙𝑒𝑒

where – 
 
(i) 
𝑅𝑅ത𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜,𝑐𝑐 refers to the instantaneous interest rate shock for currency c 
and the short shock type computed in paragraph 3 of this Annex or, 
in the case of currencies not specified in Table 10C-1, paragraph 4 
of this Annex; and 
 
(ii) 
𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) refers to the shaping scalar and is defined as (𝑒𝑒
−𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘

diminishes towards zero at the tenor of the longest point in the term 
structure1064,1065; 
 
(c) 
long rate shock for currency c1066, ∆𝑅𝑅𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘), that refers to a shock up or 
down that is greatest at the longest tenor midpoint – 
 
∆𝑅𝑅𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) = ±𝑅𝑅ത𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙,𝑐𝑐∙𝑆𝑆𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) = ±𝑅𝑅ത𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙,𝑐𝑐∙(1 −𝑒𝑒

where – 
 
(i) 
𝑅𝑅ത𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙,𝑐𝑐 refers to the instantaneous interest rate shock for currency c 
and the long shock type computed in paragraph 3 of this Annex or, 
in the case of currencies not specified in Table 10C-1, paragraph 4 
of this Annex; and 
 
(ii) 
𝑆𝑆𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) is related to the shaping scalar referred to in sub-paragraph 
(b)(ii) via the following relationship: 𝑆𝑆𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) = 1 −𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘); 
 
(d) 
steepener shock, ∆𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘), and flattener shock, ∆𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘), for 
currency c that involves rotations to the term structure of the interest 
rates where both the long and short rates are shocked to derive the 
steepener and flattener interest rate scenarios respectively. A Reporting 
Bank must obtain the shift in interest rates at each tenor midpoint by 
applying the following formulas to those shocks – 
 
∆𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) = −0.65 ∙ห∆𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘)ห+ 0.9 ∙ห∆𝑅𝑅𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘)ห

(ii) 
∆𝑅𝑅𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙,𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘) refers to the long rate shock for currency c computed in 
sub-paragraph (c). 
 
8 
A Reporting Bank must, subsequent to the application of the 6 interest rate 
shock scenarios set out in paragraph 2 of this Annex, floor all post-shock interest rates 
(excluding commercial margins and other spread components) at -100bps. 
 
 
 
1064 
The value of x in the denominator of the function 𝑒𝑒
−𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘
𝑥𝑥controls the rate of decay of the shock. 
1065 
𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘 is the midpoint (in time) of the kth bucket. There are 19 buckets in the standardised framework, but the 
analysis may be generalised to any number of buckets. 
1066 
The long rate shock is only used for computing the steepener and flattener shocks set out in paragraph 
7(d) of this Annex.

Annex 10D 
 
GUIDELINES ON IRRBB 
 
 
Section 1: Selection Process for a Reporting Bank’s Internal Interest Rate Shock 
and Stress Scenarios 
 
1.1 
A Reporting Bank should have in place a selection process for its internal 
interest rate shock and stress scenarios by doing the following: 
 
(a) 
have in place a stress testing framework for IRRBB which ensures that the 
opinions of the various experts on IRRBB in the Reporting Bank are taken 
into account. The identification of relevant shock and stress scenarios for 
IRRBB, the application of sound modelling approaches and the appropriate 
use of the stress testing results require the collaboration of different 
experts (e.g. traders, the treasury department, the finance department, 
the ALCO, the risk management and risk control departments and the 
Reporting Bank’s economists) within the Reporting Bank; 
 
(b) 
determine, by currency, a range of potential interest rate movements 
against which the Reporting Bank will measure its IRRBB exposures, and 
ensure that risk is measured under a reasonable range of potential interest 
rate scenarios, including some containing severe stress elements. In 
developing the scenarios, the Reporting Bank should consider a variety of 
factors, such as the shape and level of the current term structure of 
interest rates and the historical and implied volatility of interest rates. In 
low interest rate environments, the Reporting Bank should also consider 
negative interest rate scenarios and the possibility of asymmetrical effects 
of negative interest rates on its assets and liabilities; 
 
(c) 
consider the nature and sources of its IRRBB exposures, the time it would 
need to take action to reduce or unwind unfavourable IRRBB exposures, 
and its capability and willingness to withstand accounting losses in order 
to reposition its risk profile. The Reporting Bank should select scenarios 
that provide meaningful estimates of risk and include a range of shocks 
that is sufficiently wide to allow the Board or its delegates, as the case 
may be, to understand the risks inherent in the Reporting Bank’s products 
and activities. When developing interest rate shock and stress scenarios 
for IRRBB, the Reporting Bank should – 
 
(i) 
have scenarios which are sufficiently wide-ranging to identify parallel 
and non-parallel gap risk, basis risk and option risk. In many cases, 
static interest rate shocks may be insufficient to assess IRRBB 
exposure adequately. The Reporting Bank should ensure that the 
scenarios are both severe and plausible, in light of the existing level 
of interest rates and the interest rate cycle; 
 
(ii) 
give special consideration to instruments or markets where 
concentrations exist, because those positions may be more difficult 
to liquidate or offset in a stressful market environment; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-71 
(iii) assess the possible interaction of IRRBB with its related risks, as well 
as other risks (for example, credit risk and liquidity risk); 
 
(iv) assess the effect of adverse changes in the spreads of new assets 
and liabilities which are replacing those assets and liabilities 
maturing over the horizon of the forecast on its NII; 
 
(v) 
where the Reporting Bank has significant option risk, include 
scenarios that capture the exercise of such options. For example, a 
Reporting Bank that has products with sold caps or floors should 
include scenarios that assess how the risk positions would change 
should those caps or floors move into the money. Given that the 
market value of options fluctuates with changes in the volatility of 
interest rates, the Reporting Bank should develop interest rate 
assumptions to measure its IRRBB exposures to changes in interest 
rate volatilities; and 
 
(vi) specify the assumptions used in building its interest rate shock and 
stress scenarios such as the term structure of interest rates that will 
be incorporated and the basis relationship between yield curves and 
between rate indices. The Reporting Bank should also estimate how 
interest rates that are administered or managed (for example, prime 
rates or retail deposit rates, as opposed to those that are purely 
market-driven) might change, and should document how these 
assumptions are derived; 
 
(d) 
incorporate into forward-looking scenarios – 
 
(i) 
changes in portfolio composition due to factors under the control of 
the Reporting Bank (for example, its acquisition and production 
plans), as well as external factors (for example, changing 
competitive, legal or tax environments); 
 
(ii) 
the introduction of new products where only limited historical data 
are available; and 
 
(iii) new market information and new emerging risks that are not 
necessarily covered by historical stress episodes; 
 
(e) 
perform qualitative and quantitative reverse stress tests1067 in order to – 
 
(i) 
identify interest rate scenarios that could severely threaten the 
Reporting Bank’s capital and earnings; and 
 
(ii) 
reveal vulnerabilities arising from its hedging strategies and the 
potential behavioural reactions of its customers.

2.2 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.24 of Annex 10A, a Reporting Bank should – 
 
(a) 
for accurate and timely measurement of IRRBB for effective risk 
management and control, ensure that its risk measurement system is able 
to identify and quantify the major sources of IRRBB exposure. The 
Reporting Bank should select the most appropriate form of measurement 
system by considering the mix of its business lines and the risk 
characteristics of its activities; 
 
(b) 
rely on more than one measure of risk, given that risk management 
systems tend to vary in how they capture the components of IRRBB. The 
Reporting Bank should use a variety of methodologies to quantify its 
IRRBB exposures under both the economic value and earnings-based 
measures, ranging from simple calculations based on static simulations 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-73 
using current holdings to more sophisticated dynamic modelling 
techniques that reflect potential future business activities; 
 
(c) 
ensure that its management information system allows it to retrieve 
accurate IRRBB information in a timely manner and captures interest rate 
risk data on all its material IRRBB exposures. The Reporting Bank should 
also ensure that there is sufficient documentation of the major data 
sources used in the Reporting Bank’s risk measurement process; 
 
(d) 
use data inputs that are automated as much as possible to reduce 
administrative errors. The Reporting Bank should periodically review and 
test the data mapping against an approved model version, and should 
monitor the type of data extracts and set appropriate controls; and 
 
(e) 
ensure that, where cash flows are slotted into different time buckets (for 
example, for gap analyses) or assigned to different vertex points to reflect 
the different tenors of the interest rate curve, the slotting criteria is stable 
over time to allow for a meaningful comparison of risk figures over 
different periods. 
 
2.3 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.26 of Annex 10A, a Reporting Bank should – 
 
(a) 
ensure that the validation of IRRBB measurement methods and 
assessment of corresponding model risk is included in a formal policy 
process that is reviewed and approved by the Board or its delegates. The 
Reporting Bank should specify the management roles and designate the 
parties responsible for the development, implementation and use of 
models in the policy. In addition, the Reporting Bank should specify and 
integrate, within the governance processes for model risk management, 
the 
model 
oversight 
responsibilities 
and 
policies 
including 
the 
development of initial and ongoing validation procedures, evaluation of 
results, approval, version control, exception, escalation, modification and 
decommission processes; 
 
(b) 
have in place an effective IRRBB validation framework, which should 
include 3 core elements, namely – 
 
(i) 
evaluation of conceptual and methodological soundness, including 
developmental evidence; 
 
(ii) 
ongoing model monitoring, including process verification and 
benchmarking; and 
 
(iii) outcomes analysis, including backtesting of key internal parameters 
(for example, stability of deposits, prepayments, early redemptions, 
pricing of instruments); 
 
(c) 
address the expected initial and ongoing model validation activities, 
establish in the policy set out in sub-paragraph (a) a hierarchical process 
for determining model risk soundness based on both quantitative and 
qualitative dimensions such as size, impact, past performance and 
familiarity with the modelling technique employed; 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-74 
 
(d) 
ensure that model risk management for IRRBB measures follows a holistic 
approach that begins with motivation, development and implementation 
by model owners and users. The Reporting Bank should ensure that the 
process 
for 
determining 
model 
inputs, 
assumptions, 
modelling 
methodologies and outputs is reviewed and validated independently of the 
development of IRRBB models, prior to the model receiving authorisation 
for usage. The Reporting Bank should present the review and validation 
results and any recommendations on model usage to the Board or its 
delegates for approval, and upon approval, subject the model to ongoing 
review, process verification and validation at a frequency that is consistent 
with the level of model risk determined and approved by the Reporting 
Bank; 
 
(e) 
ensure that the ongoing validation process establishes a set of exception 
trigger events that obligate the model reviewers to notify the Board or its 
delegates in a timely fashion, in order to determine any corrective actions 
or restrictions on model usage. The Reporting Bank should designate clear 
version control authorisations, where appropriate, to model owners. With 
the passage of time and due to observations and new information gained 
over time, the Reporting Bank may modify or decommission an approved 
model. The Reporting Bank should have in place policies for model 
transition, including change and version control authorisations and 
documentation; 
 
(f) 
include in the validation process model inputs or assumptions which may 
be sourced from IRRBB models developed by third-party vendors, related 
modelling processes or sub-models (both in-house and vendor-sourced). 
The Reporting Bank should document and explain model specification 
choices as part of the validation process; 
 
(g) 
where the Reporting Bank purchases IRRBB models, ensure adequate 
documentation of its use of those models, including any specific 
customisation. If vendors provide input for market data, behavioural 
assumptions or model settings, the Reporting Bank should have a process 
in place to determine if those inputs are reasonable for its business and 
the risk characteristics of its activities; and 
 
(h) 
ensure that its IA review the model risk management process as part of 
its annual risk assessment and audit plans, where such audit activity 
should not duplicate model risk management processes, but should review 
the integrity and effectiveness of the risk management system and the 
model risk management process. 
 
2.4 
For the purposes of paragraph 5.27 of Annex 10A, a Reporting Bank should – 
 
(a) 
report risk measures to the Board or its delegates regularly, and compare 
current exposure with policy limits. In particular, the Reporting Bank 
should report the results of the periodic model reviews and audits as well 
as comparisons of past forecasts or risk estimates with actual results to 
inform the Board or its delegates of potential modelling shortcomings on 
a regular basis. The Reporting Bank should clearly identify portfolios that 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-75 
may be subject to significant mark-to-market movements within the 
Reporting Bank’s management information system and subject such 
portfolios to oversight in line with any other portfolios exposed to market 
risk; 
 
(b) 
ensure that the reports prepared for the Board or its delegates, as the 
case may be, include the following: 
 
(i) 
summaries of the Reporting Bank’s aggregate IRRBB exposures, and 
explanatory text that highlights the assets, liabilities, cash flows, and 
strategies that are driving the level and direction of IRRBB; 
 
(ii) 
reports demonstrating the Reporting Bank’s compliance with policies 
and limits; 
 
(iii) key 
modelling 
assumptions 
such 
as 
NMD 
characteristics, 
prepayments on fixed rate loans and currency aggregation; 
 
(iv) results of stress tests, including assessment of sensitivity to key 
assumptions and parameters; 
 
(v) 
summaries of the reviews of IRRBB policies, procedures and 
adequacy of the measurement systems, including any findings of 
internal and external auditors, or other equivalent external parties 
(such as consultants); and 
 
(c) 
ensure that reports detailing its IRRBB exposures are provided to the 
Board or its delegates, as the case may be, on a timely basis and reviewed 
regularly. The Reporting Bank should ensure that such IRRBB reports 
provide aggregate information as well as sufficient supporting detail to 
enable the Board or its delegates, as the case may be, to assess the 
sensitivity of the Reporting Bank to changes in market conditions, with 
particular reference to portfolios that may potentially be subject to 
significant mark-to-market movements. The Board or its delegates, as the 
case may be, should review the Reporting Bank’s IRRBB management 
policies and procedures in light of the reports, to ensure that they remain 
appropriate and sound. The Board or its delegates, as the case may be, 
should also ensure that analysis and risk management activities related to 
IRRBB are conducted by competent staff with technical knowledge and 
experience, consistent with the nature and scope of the Reporting Bank’s 
activities. 
 
 
Section 3: Internal Assessment of Capital Adequacy for IRRBB 
 
3.1 
For the purposes of evaluating its capital adequacy for IRRBB, a Reporting Bank 
should take the following into account: 
 
(a) 
the size and tenor of internal limits on IRRBB exposures, and whether 
these limits are reached at the point of capital calculation; 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-76 
(b) 
the effectiveness and expected cost of hedging open positions that are 
intended to take advantage of internal expectations of the future level of 
interest rates; 
 
(c) 
the sensitivity of the internal measures of IRRBB to key modelling 
assumptions, including key assumptions on ∆EVE such as the inclusion or 
exclusion of commercial margins, the Reporting Bank’s actual equity 
allocation profile, the stability of NMDs and prepayment optionality; 
 
(d) 
the impact of interest rate shock and stress scenarios set out in paragraph 
5.18 of Annex 10A on positions priced off different interest rate indices; 
 
(e) 
the impact on economic value and NII of mismatched positions in different 
currencies; 
 
(f) 
the impact of embedded losses; 
 
(g) 
the distribution of capital relative to risks across different entities in the 
banking group, in addition to overall Group level capital adequacy; 
 
(h) 
the drivers of the underlying risk; 
 
(i) 
the circumstances under which the risk might crystallise. 
 
3.2 
A Reporting Bank should – 
 
(a) 
ensure that the contribution of IRRBB to its overall internal capital 
assessment is based on the Reporting Bank’s IMS outputs, taking account 
of key assumptions and risk limits. The Reporting Bank should also ensure 
that the overall level of capital is commensurate with its actual measured 
level of risk (including for IRRBB) and its risk appetite, and is duly 
documented in its ICAAP report; 
 
(b) 
develop its own methodologies for capital allocation, based on its risk 
appetite. In determining the appropriate level of capital, the Reporting 
Bank should consider both the amount and the quality of capital needed; 
 
(c) 
consider its capital adequacy for IRRBB in relation to the risks to economic 
value, given that such risks are embedded in the Reporting Bank’s assets, 
liabilities and off-balance sheet items. For risks to future earnings, given 
the possibility that future earnings may be lower than expected, the 
Reporting Bank should consider capital buffers. The Reporting Bank should 
consider – 
 
(i) 
the ∆EVE under a variety of interest rate shock and stress scenarios. 
Where the Reporting Bank’s EVE is significantly sensitive to interest 
rate shock and stress scenarios, the Reporting Bank should assess 
the impact on its capital adequacy arising from financial instruments 
held at market value, and the potential impact in the case where 
banking book positions held at historical cost become subject to 
market valuation; and 
 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
10-77 
(ii) 
the strength and stability of the earnings stream and the level of 
income needed to generate and maintain normal business 
operations. Where the Reporting Bank has a high level of IRRBB 
exposures, that could under a plausible range of market scenarios, 
result in the Reporting Bank reporting losses or curtailing normal 
dividend distribution and business operations, the Reporting Bank 
should ensure that it has sufficient capital to withstand the adverse 
impact of such events until it can implement mitigating actions such 
as reducing IRRBB exposures or increasing capital; and 
 
(d) 
ensure that its evaluation of its capital adequacy for IRRBB as part of its 
ICAAP flows through to assessments of capital associated with business 
lines. 
 
 
Section 4: Further Guidance 
 
4.1 
For further guidance, a Reporting Bank should refer to “SRP 98 – Application 
guidance on interest rate risk in the banking book”, issued by the BCBS in December 2019, 
and any other relevant publications issued by the BCBS and the Authority in this area.

PART XI: PUBLIC DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS 
Division 1: Introduction 
11.1.1 
The public disclosure requirements set out in this Part complement the 
minimum capital requirements under Pillar 1 and the supervisory review process set out 
in Part X. The purpose of the requirements in this Part is to promote market discipline by 
requiring disclosures of key information relating to a Reporting Bank’s regulatory capital 
and risk exposures on a consistent and comparable basis. Some disclosures also serve as 
a qualifying criterion for more advanced approaches under Pillar 11068. 
Principles for Disclosures 
11.1.2 
A Reporting Bank must apply the following principles 1069  in making its 
disclosures: 
(a)
the Reporting Bank must ensure that disclosures are clear. The Reporting
Bank must present the disclosures in a form that is understandable and
communicate the disclosures through an accessible medium. The
Reporting Bank must highlight important messages which must be easily
located. The Reporting Bank must explain complex issues in simple
language with key terms defined. The Reporting Bank must present
related risk information together;
(b)
the Reporting Bank must ensure that disclosures are comprehensive. The
Reporting Bank must disclose its main activities and all significant risks,
supported by relevant data and information. The Reporting Bank must
describe significant changes in risk exposures between reporting periods,
together with the management’s response. The Reporting Bank must
provide sufficient qualitative and quantitative information on its processes
and procedures for identifying, measuring and managing those risks. The
Reporting Bank must ensure that the level of detail of such disclosures is
proportionate to the complexity of the Reporting Bank. The Reporting
Bank’s disclosures must reflect how the Board and senior management
internally assess and manage risks and strategy, helping users to better
understand the risk tolerance or appetite of the Reporting Bank;
(c)
the Reporting Bank must ensure that disclosures provide meaningful
information to users. The Reporting Bank must highlight its most
significant current and emerging risks and how these risks are managed,
including information that is likely to receive market attention;
(d)
the Reporting Bank must ensure that disclosures are consistent over
time 1070 . The Reporting Bank must highlight and explain additions,
deletions and important changes in disclosures from previous reports,
1068
Disclosures marked with an asterisk in this Part are conditions for use of a particular approach for the 
calculation of regulatory capital. 
1069
These principles aim to strengthen the transparency and quality of risk disclosures that will enable users 
to better understand and compare the Reporting Bank’s business and its risks. 
1070
This is to enable users to identify trends in the risk profile of the Reporting Bank across all significant 
aspects of its business. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
11-2 
 
including those arising from the Reporting Bank’s specific, regulatory or 
market developments. 
 
 
Division 2: General Requirements 
 
Sub-division 1: Scope of Application

This Part applies to a Reporting Bank at the Group level, in accordance with 
paragraph 3.1.1(b) unless otherwise stated. 
 
11.2.2 
A Reporting Bank need not comply with the requirements in this Part if it is a 
subsidiary of – 
 
(a)  another Reporting Bank which is subject to the requirements in this Part; 
or 
 
(b)  a financial holding company which is subject to requirements similar to 
that set out in this Part. 
 
 
Sub-division 2: Frequency and Timing of Disclosures 
 
11.2.3 
A Reporting Bank must make the disclosures required under Division 3 of this 
Part according to the frequency of disclosure for each disclosure requirement set out in 
Table 11-1. 
 
11.2.4 
Notwithstanding paragraph 11.2.3, where the Reporting Bank is not designated 
by the Authority as a D-SIB and – 
 
(a)  has not been notified by the Authority that it is an internationally active 
bank; or 
 
(b)  is a subsidiary of a banking institution incorporated outside Singapore, 
 
the Reporting Bank may make the disclosures required under Division 3 of this Part, except 
for disclosure requirements set out in Table 11-2, as follows:  
 
(i) 
where the frequency of disclosure for a disclosure requirement set out in 
Table 11-1 is on a quarterly basis, the Reporting Bank may make such 
disclosures on a semi-annual basis; 
 
(ii) 
where the frequency of disclosure for a disclosure requirement set out in 
Table 11-1 is on a semi-annual basis, the Reporting Bank may make such 
disclosures on an annual basis. 
 
11.2.5 
 For disclosures which are required to be made for a reporting period ending 
otherwise than at the close of an annual reporting period in this Part, a Reporting Bank 
which issues quarterly financial statements must make such disclosure concurrently with 
the publication of its quarterly financial statements, and in any case no later than 45 days 
after the end of the reporting period. A Reporting Bank which does not issue quarterly

11-3 
 
financial statements must make such disclosure no later than 45 days after the end of the 
reporting period. 
 
11.2.6 
For disclosures which are required to be made for a reporting period ending at 
the close of an annual reporting period in this Part, a Reporting Bank which issues an 
annual report must make such disclosure concurrently with the publication of its annual 
report or financial statements, and in any case no later than 4 months after the end of the 
reporting period. A Reporting Bank which does not issue an annual report must make such 
disclosure no later than 4 months after the end of the reporting period. 
 
11.2.7 
A Reporting Bank must make the disclosures required under Division 3 of this 
Part with effect from 1 July 2024. 
 
 
Sub-division 3: Location and Form of Disclosures  
  
11.2.8 
Subject to paragraphs 11.3.18 and 11.3.30, a Reporting Bank must disclose 
the information required in Division 3 of this Part, in a standalone document (“standalone 
Pillar 3 report”), which may be appended to, or form a discrete section of its annual report 
or periodic financial statements. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the standalone Pillar 
3 report is easily identifiable to users. The Reporting Bank must make available on its 
website, an archive of a minimum of 5 years, of information disclosed pursuant to this Part 
relating to prior reporting periods. 
 
11.2.9  
A Reporting Bank may disclose items set out in the tables marked as having a 
flexible format in Division 3 of this Part in a separate document from the standalone Pillar 
3 report, provided that – 
 
(a)  the level of assurance on the reliability of data in the separate document 
is equivalent to, or greater than, the internal assurance level required for 
the standalone Pillar 3 report, as set out in paragraphs 11.2.18 to 11.2.20; 
and 
 
(b)  the Reporting Bank includes in the standalone Pillar 3 report, the following 
information: 
 
(i) 
the title and the number of the disclosure requirement; 
 
(ii) 
the full name of the separate document in which the disclosure 
requirement has been published; 
 
(iii) a URL to such disclosure of information on its website, where relevant; 
 
(iv) the page and paragraph number of the separate document where 
the disclosure requirement may be located. 
 
11.2.10 
A Reporting Bank must complete the quantitative data required under the tables 
in Division 3 of this Part in accordance with the definitions provided in the table. The 
Reporting Bank must present narrative commentaries to supplement such required 
quantitative disclosures in a format to be determined at the Reporting Bank’s discretion 
and to explain any significant changes between reporting periods and any other issues of 
interest to market participants. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
11-4 
 
 
Tables with a Fixed Format in Division 3 of this Part 
 
11.2.11 
Where the format of a table in Division 3 of this Part is marked as fixed, a 
Reporting Bank must complete the fields in accordance with the instructions given in the 
table. Subject to paragraph 11.2.16, the Reporting Bank may delete rows or columns from 
the table but must not alter the numbering of subsequent rows and columns. The 
Reporting Bank may add additional sub-rows and sub-columns to the table to provide 
additional details to a disclosure requirement. However, the Reporting Bank must not alter 
the numbering of prescribed rows and columns in the table. 
 
 
Tables with a Flexible Format in Division 3 of this Part 
 
11.2.12 
Where the format of a table in Division 3 of this Part is marked as flexible, a 
Reporting Bank may present the required information either in the format provided in the 
table, or in one that is more suitable for the Reporting Bank. However, where a customised 
presentation of the information is used, the Reporting Bank must provide information that 
is comparable1071 with the disclosure requirements set out in the table. 
 
 
Disclosure Requirements Presented in the Form of Tables or Templates in 
Division 3 of this Part 
 
11.2.13 
For the disclosure requirements presented in the form of templates or tables in 
Division 3 of this Part, a Reporting Bank has the discretion to determine the form of the 
disclosures required in this Part, and may choose to use either graphical or such other 
forms or both, that the Reporting Bank deems appropriate to assist users in forming an 
opinion on the risk profile and capital adequacy of the Reporting Bank. 
 
 
Sub-division 4: Omissions 
 
11.2.14  A Reporting Bank may omit certain disclosures in this Part if the omitted item 
is proprietary or confidential in nature, where “proprietary” and “confidential” are defined, 
respectively, as follows: 
 
(a)  proprietary information refers to information that if shared with the public 
would undermine the competitive position of the Reporting Bank; 
 
(b)  confidential information refers to information that if shared with the public 
would cause the Reporting Bank to breach the terms of a legal agreement. 
 
11.2.15 
The Reporting Bank must identify the specific information that it has omitted to 
disclose in the narrative commentary to the disclosure requirement and provide a reason 
for the omission. The Reporting Bank must also disclose general qualitative information 
about the subject matter of the requirement. 
 
11.2.16 
In line with the principle set out in paragraph 11.1.2(c), a Reporting Bank may 
omit part or all of the disclosures in the tables in Division 3 of this Part, if the information 
required to be disclosed is assessed by the Reporting Bank not to provide meaningful 
information to users. In particular, the Reporting Bank must assess if the information 
required to be disclosed would provide meaningful information to users in accordance with 
 
1071 
At a similar level of granularity.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
11-5 
 
the requirements set out in the scope of application fields in the tables. The Reporting 
Bank which omits disclosures in the tables in Division 3 of this Part on the basis that the 
disclosure of the information is not meaningful must state clearly in a narrative 
commentary why such information is considered not to be meaningful to users. Where 
applicable, the Reporting Bank must describe the portfolios excluded from the disclosures 
and the aggregate total RWA of those portfolios. 
 
11.2.17 
A Reporting Bank may omit disclosures required under any item in this Part, 
marked as qualitative disclosures, if the Reporting Bank – 
 
(a) 
is a subsidiary of a banking institution that is incorporated outside 
Singapore and the banking institution is subject to disclosure requirements 
similar to those set out in this Part on a consolidated basis that is inclusive 
of the operations of the Reporting Bank; and 
 
(b) 
makes clear reference in the standalone Pillar 3 report to the location of 
the relevant disclosures made by the banking institution referred to in sub-
paragraph (a). 
 
 
Sub-division 5: Disclosure Policy 
 
11.2.18 
A Reporting Bank must ensure that the information it discloses in accordance 
with Division 3 of this Part is subject, at a minimum, to the same level of internal review 
and internal control processes as the information provided by the Reporting Bank for its 
financial reporting, if applicable, and the level of assurance must be the same as for 
information provided within the management discussion and analysis part of its annual 
report. 
 
11.2.19 
A Reporting Bank must have in place a written disclosure policy which sets out 
the approach of the Reporting Bank for determining which disclosures it will make and the 
internal controls over the disclosure process, and the Reporting Bank must ensure that 
this policy is approved by the Board of the Reporting Bank. 
 
11.2.20 
A Reporting Bank must describe the key elements of the disclosure policy in the 
year-end standalone Pillar 3 report or cross-reference to another location1072 where they 
are available. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the Board and senior management of 
the Reporting Bank are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal 
control processes over the disclosure of financial information, including the disclosures 
required under this Part, and the appropriate review of the disclosures. The Reporting 
Bank must ensure that one or more senior officers of the Reporting Bank, ideally a Board 
member or equivalent, attest in writing that the disclosures required under this Part have 
been prepared in accordance with the internal control processes approved by the Board of 
the Reporting Bank. 
 
11.2.21 
A Reporting Bank may disclose 1073  additional quantitative and qualitative 
information to provide users with a broader picture of the Reporting Bank’s risk position 
and promote market discipline.  
 
1072 
For example, the Reporting Bank’s website or publicly available regulatory reports.  
1073 
If the Reporting Bank discloses additional quantitative and qualitative information, it should ensure that 
such information provides sufficient meaningful information to enable users to understand and analyse any 
figures provided, and is accompanied by a qualitative discussion. 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
11-6 
 
Sub-division 6: Transitional Arrangements 
 
11.2.22 
For templates which require the disclosure of data points for current and 
previous reporting periods, the Reporting Bank may omit the disclosure of the data point 
for the previous period when a metric is reported for the first time unless such disclosure 
of the data point is explicitly stated in the disclosure requirement. 
 
11.2.23 
When a Reporting Bank is applying transitional arrangements permitted by this 
Notice, the Reporting Bank must report the transitional data unless otherwise specified in 
the relevant disclosure templates or this Division or the Reporting Bank is applying the 
fully loaded requirements. 1074 To avoid doubt, this paragraph does not apply to the 
transitional arrangement in respect of the output floor calibration set out in paragraph 
5.1.6 and risk weights applicable to equity exposures as set out in paragraph 7.3.85. 
 
11.2.24 
Despite paragraph 11.2.23, the Reporting Bank must omit the disclosures in 
the tables in Sub-division 7 and Sub-division 15 of Division 3 of this Part, for the period 
from 1 July 2024 to 31 December 2024 (both dates inclusive). 
 
11.2.25 
Despite paragraph 11.2.23, the Reporting Bank must make the disclosures in 
Table 11-24 and the tables in Sub-division 7 of Division 3 of Part XI of MAS Notice 637 in 
force immediately before 1 July 2024, for the period from 1 July 2024 to 31 December 
2024 (both dates inclusive). 
 
11.2.26 
Despite the cancellation of MAS Notice 637 in force immediately before 1 July 
2024, for the reporting period ending before 1 July 2024, if the Reporting Bank has not by 
1 July 2024 made the disclosures referred to in paragraph 11.2.3 of MAS Notice 637 in 
force immediately before 1 July 2024, paragraphs 11.2.5 and 11.2.6 of this Notice does 
not apply, and the Reporting Bank must comply with paragraphs 11.2.4 and 11.2.5 of MAS 
Notice 637 in force immediately before 1 July 2024. 
 
11.2.27 
Despite the cancellation of MAS Notice 637 in force immediately before 1 July 
2024, where the Reporting Bank is or was required to comply with paragraph 11.2.3 of 
MAS Notice 637 in force immediately before 1 July 2024, the Reporting Bank must continue 
to make available on its website an archive of a minimum of five years of information 
disclosed pursuant to Part XI of MAS Notice 637 in force immediately before 1 July 2024 
relating to prior reporting periods. 
 
 
 
 
 
1074  The Reporting Bank should clearly state whether the figures disclosed are computed on a transitional or 
fully-loaded basis. Where applicable, the Reporting Bank under a transitional regime may separately 
disclose fully-loaded figures in addition to transitional metrics.

11.3.4 
A Reporting Bank must disclose all items set out in Tables 11-2 to 11-4. In the 
case where a Reporting Bank has adopted –  
 
(a)  the nominated approaches that are not standardised approaches set out 
in column (b) of Table 5-1 or 5-2, as applicable, the Reporting Bank must 
disclose all items set out in Table 11-5; and 
 
(b)  the IRBA, the Reporting Bank must disclose all items set out in  
Table 11-6. 
 
Table 11-2: Key Metrics 
Purpose 
To provide an overview of a Reporting Bank’s prudential regulatory 
metrics. 
Scope of 
application  
This table is mandatory for all Reporting Banks. 
Content  
Key prudential metrics related to regulatory capital, leverage ratio and 
liquidity standards. The Reporting Bank is required to disclose each 
metric’s value using the corresponding standard’s specifications for the 
reporting period-end (designated by T in the template below) as well 
as the 4 previous quarter-end figures (T-1 to T-4). 
Frequency  
Quarterly 
Format  
Fixed. If the Reporting Bank wishes to add rows to provide additional 
regulatory or financial metrics, it must provide definitions for these 
metrics and a full explanation of how the metrics are calculated 
(including the scope of consolidation and the regulatory capital used if 
relevant). The additional metrics must not replace the metrics in this 
disclosure requirement. 
Accompanying 
narrative 
The Reporting Bank must supplement the template with a narrative 
commentary to explain any significant change in each metric’s value 
compared with previous quarters, including the key drivers of such 
changes.1075

To provide an overview of total RWA and further breakdowns of RWA. 
Scope of 
application  
This table is mandatory for all Reporting Banks. 
Content  
RWA and capital requirements1081 under Pillar 1. A Reporting Bank 
must split CCR exposures based on the EAD methodology applied and 
not the risk-weighting methodology. Nevertheless, the Reporting 
Bank must add extra rows, as appropriate, to split the CCR exposures 
by risk-weighting methodology, in order to facilitate the reconciliation 
with the RWA changes in Table 11-32.

Accompanying 
narrative 
The Reporting Bank must supplement the table with a narrative 
commentary identifying and explaining the drivers behind differences 
in current and prior quarterly reporting periods, where such 
differences are significant. The Reporting Bank must explain in the 
narrative commentary the adjustments made where minimum capital 
requirements in column (c) do not correspond to the RWA in column 
(a) multiplied by the minimum Total CAR requirement applicable to 
the Reporting Bank as defined in paragraph 4.1.5 or 4.1.6, as the

Table 11-7A: Explanatory Notes to Differences between Accounting and Regulatory Scopes of Consolidation and Mapping of Financial 
Statement Categories with Regulatory Risk Categories 
Instructions  
(a) 
A Reporting Bank must strictly follow the balance sheet presentation in its financial reporting. 
(b) 
Columns (a) and (b) must be merged if the Reporting Bank’s accounting scope of consolidation is the same as its regulatory 
scope of consolidation. 
(c) 
Column (g) includes amounts not subject to capital requirements or subject to deductions from regulatory capital. The Reporting 
Bank must include in column (g) elements which are deducted from the Reporting Bank’s regulatory capital1084, taking into 
consideration the different thresholds that apply where relevant. The Reporting Bank must disclose the assets for the amount 
that is actually deducted from capital1085. The Reporting Bank must disclose the 1250% risk-weighted exposures in the relevant 
credit risk or securitisation framework requirements under columns (c) to (e), instead of disclosing them under column (g). 
Liabilities disclosed in column (g) are all liabilities under the regulatory scope of consolidation, except for the following, which are 
disclosed in columns (c), (d), (e) and (f) as applicable: liabilities that are included in the determination of the exposure values in 
the market risk or the counterparty credit risk framework, and liabilities that are eligible under the Basel netting rules. 
(d) 
Where an item is subjected to capital requirements from more than one risk category framework, the Reporting Bank must report 
the item in all columns that it is subjected to capital requirements. Therefore, the sum of amounts reported in columns (c) to (g) 
may be greater than the amount reported in column (b)1086.  
 
1084 
For example, goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets.  
1085 
Some examples are shown below: 
(a)  Goodwill and intangible assets: the amount to be disclosed in column (g) is the amount of any goodwill or intangibles, including any goodwill included in the valuation 
of significant investments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation. The amount disclosed in 
the assets rows is net of any associated deferred tax liability which would be extinguished if the intangible assets become impaired or derecognised under the 
relevant accounting standards. The associated deferred tax liability is also to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). 
(b)  Deferred tax assets: for all types of deferred tax assets to be deducted from own funds, the amount to be disclosed in column (g) is net of associated deferred tax 
liabilities that are eligible for netting. The associated deferred tax liabilities are to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). For deferred tax assets, for which 
the deduction is subject to a threshold, the amount disclosed in column (g) in the assets rows is the amount, net of any eligible deferred tax liability, above the 
threshold. The associated deferred tax liabilities are also to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). 
(c)  Defined benefit pension fund assets: the amount disclosed is net of any deferred tax liabilities which would be extinguished if the asset should become impaired or 
derecognised under the relevant accounting standards. These deferred tax liabilities are also to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). 
(d)  Investments in own shares (treasury stock) or own instruments of regulatory capital: when investments in own shares or own instruments of regulatory capital are 
not already derecognised under the relevant accounting standards, the deducted amount disclosed is net of short positions in the same underlying exposure or in 
the same underlying index allowed to be netted under the Basel framework. These short positions are also to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g).  
1086 
For example, derivative assets/liabilities held in the regulatory trading book may relate to both column (d) and column (f). In such circumstances, the sum of the values 
in columns (c) to (g) would not equal to that in column (b). When amounts disclosed in 2 or more different columns are material and result in a difference between 
column (b) and the sum of columns (c) to (g), the reasons for this difference should be explained by the Reporting Bank in the accompanying narrative.

Table 11-8A: Explanatory Notes to Main Sources of Differences between Regulatory Exposure Amounts and Carrying Amounts in Financial 
Statements 
Instructions 
(a) 
Asset carrying amount under regulatory scope of consolidation: This includes only assets that are risk-weighted under the Basel 
framework, while row 2 includes liabilities that are considered for the application of the riskweighting requirements, either as short 
positions, trading or derivative liabilities, or through the application of the netting rules to calculate the net position of assets to be 
risk-weighted. These liabilities are not included in column (g) in Table 11-7. Assets that are risk-weighted under the Basel 
framework include assets that are not deducted from capital because they are under the applicable thresholds or due to the netting 
with liabilities. 
(b) 
Netting between assets and liabilities: This does not lead to accounting equity under a regulatory scope of consolidation being 
disclosed in row 3. Assets and liabilities included in rows 1 and 2 are limited to those assets and liabilities that are taken into 
consideration in the regulatory framework. Other assets and liabilities not considered in the regulatory framework are to be 
disclosed in column (g) in Table 11-7 and are consequently excluded from rows 1 and 2 of Table 11-8. 
(c) 
Off-balance sheet amounts: This includes notional amounts of off-balance sheet items in column (a) and the amounts subject to 
regulatory framework, after application of the CCFs in columns (b) to (e), where relevant. 
(d) 
Differences due to different netting rules, other than those already included in row 2: Row 2 refers to balance sheet netting, while 
row 6 refers to incremental netting in application of the Basel rules (when not already covered by balance sheet netting). The 
netting rules under the Basel framework are different from the rules under the applicable accounting frameworks. The incremental 
netting in row 6 could represent an additional deduction from the net exposure value before application of the Basel netting rules 
(when those rules lead to more netting than the balance sheet netting in row 2) or a gross-up of the net exposure value when the 
off-balance sheet netting operated in row 2 is broader than what the Basel netting rules allow. 
(e) 
Differences due to consideration of provisions: The exposure values under row 1 are the carrying amounts and hence net of specific 
and general allowances as set out in paragraphs 6.3.1(d), and 6.3.3 to 6.3.5. Nevertheless, exposures under the F-IRB and A-IRB 
approaches are risk-weighted gross of provisions. Row 7 therefore is the re-inclusion of general and specific allowances in the 
carrying amount of exposures in the F-IRB and A-IRB approaches so that the carrying amount of those exposures is reconciled 
with their regulatory exposure value. Row 7 may also include the elements qualifying as general allowances that may have been 
deducted from the carrying amount of exposures under the standardised approach and that therefore need to be reintegrated in 
the regulatory exposure value of those exposures. A Reporting Bank must include any differences between the accounting 
impairment and the regulatory allowances under the Basel framework that have an impact on the exposure amounts considered 
for regulatory purposes in row 7.  
(f) 
Exposure amounts considered for regulatory purposes: This refers to the aggregate amount considered as a starting point of the 
RWA calculation for each risk category. 


Monetary Authority of Singapore 
 
11-36 
(g) 
Column (a) is not necessarily equal to the sum of columns (b) to (e) due to assets being risk-weighted more than once (see Table 
11-7). In addition, exposure values used for riskweighting may differ under each risk framework depending on whether 
standardised approaches or internal models are used in the computation of this exposure value. Therefore, for any type of risk 
framework, the exposure values under different regulatory approaches may be presented separately in each of the columns if a 
separate presentation eases the reconciliation of the exposure values for the Reporting Bank. 
Linkages across tables 
(h) 
Amounts in rows 1 and 2 of columns (b) to (e) correspond to amounts in columns (c) to (f) of Table 11-7.  
(i) 
Column (a) in Table 11-8 corresponds to amounts in column (b) minus (g) in Table 11-7. 
(j) 
Table 11-8 is focused on assets in the regulatory scope of consolidation that are subject to the regulatory framework. Therefore, 
column (g) in Table 11-7, which includes the elements of the balance sheet that are not subject to the regulatory framework, is 
not included in Table 11-8.

Table 11-10A: Explanatory Notes to Prudent Valuation Adjustments 
Definitions 
(a) 
Closeout cost (in row 3): This refers to valuation adjustments required to take account of the valuation uncertainty to adjust for the 
fact that the position level valuations calculated do not reflect an exit price for the position or portfolio.1087 
(b) 
Concentration (in row 4): This refers to valuation adjustments over and above market price and closeout costs that would be required 
to get to a prudent exit price for positions that are larger than the size of positions for which the valuation has been calculated.1088  
(c) 
Early termination (in row 5): This refers to valuation adjustments to take into account the potential losses arising from contractual 
or non-contractual early terminations of customer trades that are not reflected in the valuation. 
(d) 
Model risk (in row 6): This refers to valuation adjustments to take into account valuation model risk which arises due to: (i) the 
potential existence of a range of different models or model calibrations which are used by users of Pillar 3 data; (ii) the lack of a 
firm exit price for the specific product being valued; (iii) the use of an incorrect valuation methodology; (iv) the risk of using 
unobservable and possibly incorrect calibration parameters; or (v) the fact that market or product factors are not captured by the 
core valuation model. 
(e) 
Operational risk (in row 7): This refers to valuation adjustments to take into account the potential losses that may be incurred as a 
result of operational risk related to valuation processes. 
(f) 
Investing and funding costs (in row 8): This refers to valuation adjustments to reflect the valuation uncertainty in the funding costs 
that other users of Pillar 3 data would factor into the exit price for a position or portfolio. It includes funding valuation adjustments 
on derivatives exposures. 
 
1087 
For example, where such valuations are calibrated to a mid-market price. 
1088 
In cases where the aggregate position held by the Reporting Bank is larger than normal traded volume or larger than the position sizes on which observable quotes or 
trades that are used to calibrate the price or inputs used by the core valuation model are based.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
11-40 
(g) 
Unearned credit spreads (in row 9): This refers to valuation adjustments to take account of the valuation uncertainty in the 
adjustment necessary to include the current value of expected losses due to counterparty default on derivative positions, including 
the valuation uncertainty on CVAs. 
(h) 
Future administrative costs (in row 10): This refers to valuation adjustments to take into account the administrative costs and future 
hedging costs over the expected life of the exposures for which a direct exit price is not applied for the closeout costs. This valuation 
adjustment has to include the operational costs arising from hedging, administration and settlement of contracts in the portfolio. 
The future administrative costs are incurred by the portfolio or position but are not reflected in the core valuation model or the 
prices used to calibrate inputs to that model. 
(i) 
Other (in row 11): This refers to valuation adjustments which are required to consider factors that will influence the exit price, but 
which do not fall in any of the categories listed in paragraph 1.16 in Annex 6C. These must be described by the Reporting Bank in 
the narrative commentary that supports the disclosure.

Gross carrying amount: The gross carrying amount is the accounting value 
before any allowances and impairments but after any write-offs. A Reporting 
Bank must not take into account any CRM. The Reporting Bank must ensure that 
the gross carrying amount of off-balance sheet exposures, which excludes 
revocable loan commitments for the purposes of this table, is measured as – 
(a)  for guarantees, the maximum amount that the Reporting Bank would have 
to pay if the guarantees were called, gross of any CCF or CRM; and  
(b)  for irrevocable loan commitments, the total amount that the Reporting Bank 
has committed to lend, gross of any CCF or CRM.  
(b) 
Write-offs: This refers to a direct reduction of the carrying amount when the 
Reporting Bank has no reasonable expectations of recovery.  
(c) 
Defaulted exposures: This refers to exposures that the Reporting Bank has 
defined as defaulted for regulatory purposes. A Reporting Bank using the 
standardised approach for credit risk must ensure that the defaulted exposures 
in Tables 11-12 and 11-13 correspond to the secured and unsecured portions of 
claims that is defaulted, as stated in Section 1 of Annex 7L. 
(d) 
Non-defaulted exposures: This refers to any exposures that are not defaulted

core features of policies and processes for on- and off-balance sheet netting; 
and  
(ii) 
extent to which the Reporting Bank makes use of on- and off-balance sheet 
netting.

(d)  
a meaningful breakdown of its credit derivative providers, and set the level of 
granularity of this breakdown in accordance with paragraph 11.1.2. The 
Reporting Bank is not required to identify its derivative counterparties nominally 
if the name of the counterparty is considered to be confidential information. 
Instead, the Reporting Bank may break down its credit derivative exposure by 
rating class or by type of counterparty1090.

and credit derivatives into loans and debt securities, the Reporting Bank may merge row 1 and row 2 or divide the 
amount by the pro-rata weight of gross carrying amounts, but must explain which method it adopted. For the purposes 
of this Part, when an exposure benefits from multiple types of credit risk mitigation mechanisms, the Reporting Bank 
must allocate the exposure value to each mechanism by order of priority based on the credit risk mitigation mechanism 
which the Reporting Bank would apply in the event of loss. The Reporting Bank must ensure that disclosure is limited 
to the value of the exposure. 1091  If the Reporting Bank wishes to disclose information regarding the over-
collateralisation, it may do so in the accompanying narrative. The Reporting Bank must disclose the amount of credit 
risk mitigation (ascribed to collateral, guarantees and credit derivatives) calculated according to the regulatory 
framework, including both the cost to sell and haircuts. 
Accompanying

from a CRM technique.  
(b) 
Exposures secured: This refers to the carrying amount of exposures that is secured by at least one CRM technique. For the 
purposes of this Part, a Reporting Bank must ensure that the allocation of the carrying amount of multi-secured exposures to their 
different CRM techniques is by the order which the CRM techniques are to be called first in the event of a loss, within the limits of 
the carrying amount of the secured exposures. 
(c) 
Exposures secured by collateral: This refers to the carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances and impairments) partly or 
totally secured by collateral. Where an exposure is secured by collateral and other CRM techniques, the carrying amount of the 
exposure secured by collateral is the remaining share of the exposure secured by collateral after consideration of the shares of 
the exposure already secured by other CRM techniques expected to be called beforehand in the event of a loss, without considering 
over-collateralisation. 
(d) 
Exposures secured by financial guarantees: This refers to the carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances and impairments) 
partly or totally secured by financial guarantees. Where an exposure is secured by financial guarantees and other CRM techniques,

For disclosure purposes, a Reporting Bank that uses the standardised approach for credit risk during the transitional period should report its equity exposures according 
to whether they would be classified as “all other equity exposures” (250%) or “speculative unlisted equity exposures” (400%). The Reporting Bank should ensure that 
risk weights disclosed for “speculative unlisted equity exposures” and “all other equity exposures” reflect the actual risk weights applied to these exposures in a particular 
year (please refer to the respective transitional arrangements set out in paragraph 7.3.85).

Table 11-24: IRBA – Backtesting of PD Per Portfolio 
Purpose 
To provide backtesting data to validate the reliability of PD calculations. This table compares the PD used in IRBA 
capital calculations with the effective default rates of a Reporting Bank’s obligors. The Reporting Bank must use, at a 
minimum, a 5-year average annual default rate to compare the PD with a more stable default rate. The Reporting Bank 
may use a longer historical period that is consistent with its actual risk management practices. 
Scope of 
application  
This table is mandatory for Reporting Banks using the A-IRBA, F-IRBA or IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class for some 
or all of their credit risk exposures. To provide meaningful information to users on the backtesting of its internal models, 
the Reporting Bank must include the key models used, in accordance with the regulatory scope of consolidation and 
explain how the scope of the described models was determined. The Reporting Bank must ensure that the commentary 
includes the percentage of RWA covered by the models for which backtesting results are shown for each of the 
Reporting Bank’s regulatory portfolios. The models to be disclosed refer to any model, or combination of models, 
approved by the Authority, for the generation of PD used for calculating capital requirements under the A-IRBA, F-
IRBA or IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class. This may include the model that is used to assign a risk rating to an 
obligor, and / or the model that calibrates the internal ratings to the PD scale.  
Content  
Modelling parameters used in IRBA calculation  
Frequency  
Annually. The frequency of the disclosure is not linked to the timing of the Reporting Bank’s backtesting. The annual 
disclosure frequency does not require a timetable of model backtesting that is calibrated on a calendar year basis. 
When the backtesting reference period is not calibrated on a calendar year basis, but on another time interval1095, 
“annual reporting period” as used in columns (f), (g) and (h) means “over the period used for the backtesting of a 
model”. The Reporting Bank must, however, disclose the time horizon (observation period/timetable) it uses for its 
backtesting. 
Format  
Flexible. The Reporting Bank must disclose one table for portfolios using F-IRBA, and one table for portfolios using A-
IRBA and IRBA for the IRBA retail asset class. 
Accompanying 
narrative 
The Reporting Bank must explain any significant change over the annual reporting period and the key drivers of such 
changes. The Reporting Bank may disclose the amount of exposure and number of obligors whose defaulted exposures 
have been cured in the annual reporting period.

Table 11-30: Composition of Collateral for CCR Exposure 
Purpose  
To provide a breakdown of all types of collateral posted or received by a Reporting Bank to support or reduce the 
CCR exposures related to derivative transactions or to SFTs, including transactions cleared through a CCP. The 
purpose of the table is to provide a view on the collateral posted or received by the Reporting Bank rather than 
the value accounted for within the regulatory computation. 
Scope of application  
This table is mandatory for all Reporting Banks. 
Content  
Carrying amounts of collateral used in derivative transactions or SFTs, regardless of whether the transactions are 
cleared through a CCP, or whether the collateral is posted to a CCP. The adjusted fair value of collateral reported 
must be computed based on the total collateral posted or received by the Reporting Bank and is not limited to 
the collateral used for mitigating CCR. 
Frequency  
Semi-annually 
Format  
Flexible. The columns are fixed, but the rows are flexible. 
Accompanying 
narrative 
The Reporting Bank must explain any significant changes over the semi-annual reporting period and the key 
drivers of such changes. The Reporting Bank may disclose the collateral eligible for credit risk mitigation using an 
accompanying narrative.

Table 11-30A: Explanatory Notes to Composition of Collateral for CCR Exposure 
Definitions 
(a) 
Collateral: This refers to both legs of the transaction.1097 The collateral received is reported in columns (a), (b) and (e), while the collateral 
posted by the Reporting Bank is reported in columns (c), (d) and (f). The adjusted fair value of collateral received or posted must 
be computed after applying the standard supervisory haircuts in Annex 7J. This means the fair value of collateral received will be 
reduced by the haircut (i.e. C(1 - H), where C is the fair value of the collateral received and H is the appropriate haircut) and the 
fair value of collateral posted will be increased after the haircut (i.e. E(1 + H), where E is the fair value of the collateral posted and 
H is the appropriate haircut). 
(b) 
Segregated: This refers to collateral which is held in a bankruptcy-remote manner. In the case where collateral is posted for centrally 
cleared trades, this refers to collateral that is posted by a clearing member or a client of a clearing member, is held by a custodian 
and is bankruptcy remote from the CCP, the clearing member, and other clients as set out in paragraphs 7.7.25 and 7.7.27. 
(c) 
Unsegregated: This refers to collateral that is not held in bankruptcy-remote manner. 
(d) 
Domestic sovereign debt: This refers to the debts of sovereign issuers in Singapore. 
(e) 
Cash - domestic currency: This refers to cash collateral that is denominated in SGD. 
 
 
1097 
For example, a Reporting Bank transfers securities to a third party, and the third party in turn posts collateral to the Reporting Bank.

Sub-division 6: Securitisation 
 
11.3.11 
A Reporting Bank must –  
 
(a)  where applicable, disclose all securitisation exposures in Tables 11-34 to 
11-36; 
 
(b)  where applicable, disclose securitisation exposures that are in its banking 
book and subject to capital requirements in Division 6 of Part VII, in  
Tables 11-37 and 11-38; and 
 
(c)  exclude disclosing in this Sub-division, the capital requirements for 
securitisation positions in its trading book that are reported in  
Sub-division 7. 
 
11.3.12 
A Reporting Bank must disclose, in Tables 11-37 and 11-38, only securitisation 
exposures that meet the requirements for the recognition of risk transference as set out 
in Sub-division 2 of Division 6 of Part VII. The Reporting Bank must disclose all 
securitisation exposures, including those that do not meet the requirements for the 
recognition of risk transference, in Tables 11-35 and 11-36. As a result, Tables 11-35 and 
11-36 may include exposures that are subject to credit risk and market risk capital 
requirements and that are also included in other parts of the standalone Pillar 3 report. 
The purpose is to provide a comprehensive view of the Reporting Bank’s securitisation 
activities. There is no double-counting of capital requirements as Tables 11-37 and 11-38 
are limited to securitisation exposures subject to capital requirements set out in Division 
6 of Part VII.

Annually 
Format  
Flexible 
 
The Reporting Bank must provide a description of – 
(a) 
its risk management objectives and policies for securitisation activities and main 
features of these activities based on the rows (c) to (g) of this table. If the 
Reporting Bank holds securitisation exposures in both the banking book and the 
trading book, the Reporting Bank must describe each of the points set out in rows 
(c) to (g) of this table by distinguishing the activities in each of the books.  
(b) 
the Reporting Bank’s objectives in relation to its securitisation and re-
securitisation activity, including the extent to which these activities transfer credit 
risk of the underlying securitised exposures away from the Reporting Bank to 
other entities, including the type of risks assumed and retained. 
(c) 
a list of – 
(i)  SPEs where it acts as sponsor1100 (but not as an originator such as an ABCP 
conduit), indicating whether the Reporting Bank consolidates the SPEs into 
its scope of regulatory consolidation; 
(ii)  affiliates that the Reporting Bank manages or advises; and that invest either 
in the securitisation exposures that the Reporting Bank has securitised or in 
SPEs that the Reporting Bank sponsors; and 
(iii)  entities to which the Reporting Bank provides implicit support and the 
associated capital impact for each of them. 
(d) 
summary of the Reporting Bank’s accounting policies for securitisation 
activities1101. 
(e) 
the names of ECAIs used for securitisations and the types of securitisation 
exposure for which each agency is used, if applicable. 
(f) 
the IAA process, including – 
(i)  structure of the internal assessment process and the relation between 
internal assessment and external ratings, including information on ECAIs as 
referenced in row (e) of this table;  
(ii)  control mechanisms for the internal assessment process including discussion 
of independence, accountability, and internal assessment process review; 
(iii)  the exposure type to which the internal assessment process is applied; and  
(iv)  stress factors used for determining credit enhancement levels, by exposure 
type1102. 
(g) 
the use of internal assessment other than for IAA capital purposes. 
 
1100 
A Reporting Bank would generally be considered “a sponsor” if it, in fact or in substance, manages or 
advises the programme, places securities into the market, or provides liquidity and/or credit enhancements. 
The programme may include, for example, the ABCP conduit programme and structured investment 
vehicles.  
1101 
Where meaningful, the Reporting Bank should differentiate between accounting policies applied for 
securitisation exposures and resecuritisation exposures. 
1102 
For example, credit cards, home equity, auto, and securitisation exposures detailed by underlying exposure 
type and security type (e.g. residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed 
securities, asset-backed securities, collateralised debt obligations) etc.

The Reporting Bank must disclose the following information – 
(a) 
a general description of the trading desk structure as defined in paragraph 
8.1.62(b), and types of instruments included in trading desks that are in-scope of 
the IMA. 
(b) 
for ES models:  
(i)  a description of trading desks covered by the ES models. Where applicable, 
the Reporting Bank must also describe the main trading desks that have not 
been included in ES regulatory calculations due to lack of historical data or 
model constraints; 
(ii)  the soundness criteria on which the internal capital adequacy assessment is 
based1103, and a description of the methodologies used to achieve a capital 
adequacy assessment that is consistent with the soundness criteria; 
(iii)  a description of the ES models1104; 
(iv)  the frequency by which model data is updated; 
(v)  a description of the ES calculation based on the most recent 250 trading day 
observation period and the most severe 250 trading day period of stress1105. 
(c) 
for SES models:  
(i)  a general description of each methodology used to achieve a capital 
assessment that for categories of NMRFs is consistent with the required 
soundness standard set out in paragraph 8.3.203. 
(d) 
for a Reporting Bank using internal models to determine the DRC:  
 
1103 
For example, the results of a forward-looking stress test may be used to assess if the soundness criteria 
on which the internal capital adequacy assessment is based is met.  
1104 
For example, the Reporting Bank may describe whether the models are based on historical simulation, 
Monte Carlo simulations or other appropriate analytical methods, and provide details on the observation 
horizon for ESR,S, identified in accordance with paragraph 8.3.188.  
1105 
The Reporting Bank should describe the reduced set of risk factors used to calibrate the period of stress, 
the share of the variations in the full ES that is explained by the reduced set of risk factors, and the 
observation period used to identify the period of stress.

constant, for the range of broad regulatory risk factor classes1109. 
9 
Capital requirement for NMRFs: This refers to aggregate regulatory capital measure calculated in accordance with paragraphs 
8.3.203 to 8.3.212, for risk factors in model-eligible desks that are deemed non-modellable. 
10 
DRC requirement model capital requirement: This refers to measure of the default risk of trading book positions, except 
those subject to SA(MR) capital requirements. This covers, inter alia, sovereign exposures (including those denominated in 
the sovereign’s domestic currency), equity positions, and defaulted debt positions. 
11 
Capital surcharge for amber trading desks: This refers to capital surcharge for eligible trading desks that are in the P&L 
attribution test “amber zone”, calculated in accordance to paragraph 8.3.244.

requirements for trading desks that are either out-of-scope for model approval or that have been deemed ineligible to use 
the IMA, corresponding to the total capital requirement under the SA(MR) as reported in row 12 of Table 11-38. 
14 
Difference in capital requirements under the IMA and SA(MR) for green and amber trading desks: This is the difference in 
capital requirements for trading desks for green and amber trading desks under IMAG,A, and capital requirements for green 
and amber trading desks under SA(MR) (SAG,A) in accordance with paragraph 8.3.243. 
15 
SA(MR) capital requirement for all trading desks (including trading desks that are in-scope of the IMA): This refers to the 
most recent SA(MR) capital requirement for all instruments across all trading desks, regardless of whether those trading 
desks are in-scope of the IMA, as set out in paragraph 8.3.243(f).

Sub-division 11: Composition of Capital 
 
11.3.18 
To enable users to compare the capital adequacy of banks across countries or 
jurisdictions, a Reporting Bank must disclose the information set out in this Sub-division 
in its published financial statements, or provide a URL in its published financial statements 
to such disclosure which is made on its website or publicly available regulatory reports. 
Regardless of the location of the disclosure, all disclosures must be in the format set out 
in this Sub-division. 
 
 
Composition of Capital Template 
 
11.3.19 
To improve consistency and ease of use of disclosures relating to the 
composition of regulatory capital, and to mitigate the risk of inconsistent formats 
undermining the objective of enhanced disclosure, a Reporting Bank must provide a 
breakdown of its regulatory capital and regulatory adjustments in the format as set out in 
the template in Annex 11A of this Part. The Reporting Bank must use the template in 
Annex 11A to capture its capital position. Where the Reporting Bank has restated its prior 
year accounting balance sheet, it must document in its past reconciliation template, the 
amendments that were made as a result of the restatement of its prior year accounting 
balance sheet.  
 
11.3.20 
To prevent a divergence of templates that could undermine the objectives of 
consistency and comparability, a Reporting Bank must not add, delete or change the 
definitions of any rows from the template set out in Annex 11A of this Part. 
 
11.3.21 
In cases where a more conservative definition of an element is required under 
this Notice relative to those set out under the Basel III capital standards, a Reporting Bank 
must clearly label them as being different from the Basel III definition, and separately 
disclose the impact of each of these differences in the notes to the template. 
 
 
Reconciliation Requirements 
 
11.3.22 
A Reporting Bank must, for the purposes of the reconciliation, publish its 
financial statements in accordance with the Accounting Standards, as at each reporting 
date for which the Reporting Bank provides its reconciliation disclosures, on its website. 
To show a full reconciliation between the balance sheet in its published financial 
statements and the regulatory capital elements reported using the template in Annex 11A, 
the Reporting Bank must perform the 3 following steps using the template in Annex 11B 
of this Part:  
 
(a) 
Step 1: Disclose the reported balance sheet under the regulatory scope of 
consolidation. 
 
(i) 
The difference in scope of consolidation for accounting purposes and 
for regulatory purposes often explains much of the difference 
between the numbers used in the calculation of regulatory capital 
and the numbers used in the Reporting Bank’s published financial 
statements. As such, a key element of the reconciliation 
requirements involves disclosing how the balance sheet in its 
published financial statements changes when the regulatory scope 
of consolidation is applied. 
 


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
11-123 
(ii) 
In addition to sub-paragraph (a)(i), the Reporting Bank must 
disclose the list of legal entities that are included within its 
accounting scope of consolidation but excluded from its regulatory 
scope of consolidation, and vice versa 1126. For entities that are 
included in both the regulatory and accounting scopes of 
consolidation, but the method of consolidation differs between these 
2 scopes, the Reporting Bank must list these legal entities separately 
and explain the differences in the consolidation methods. For each 
legal entity that is required to be disclosed by this sub-paragraph, 
the Reporting Bank must disclose the entity’s total balance sheet 
assets, total balance sheet equity (as stated on the accounting 
balance sheet of the legal entity) and a description of the principal 
activities of the entity. 
 
(iii) Where its regulatory scope of consolidation is identical to its 
accounting scope of consolidation, the Reporting Bank must state 
that there is no difference between the regulatory and accounting 
scopes of consolidation and proceed to Step 2 below. 
 
(b)  Step 2: Expand the lines of the balance sheet under the regulatory scope 
of consolidation to identify all components of regulatory capital reported 
using the template set out in Annex 11A1127. 
 
(i)  
As many elements used in the calculation of regulatory capital cannot 
be readily identified from the face of the balance sheet, the Reporting 
Bank must expand the rows of the regulatory-scope balance sheet 
such that all components of regulatory capital reported using the 
template set out in Annex 11A are disclosed separately. 
 
(ii)  In addition, each element of the expanded balance sheet must be 
given a reference number or letter for the purposes of Step 3 below.  
 
(c)  Step 3: Map each element disclosed under Step 2 to the composition of 
capital disclosure template set out in Annex 11A. 
 
(i)  
The Reporting Bank must use the reference numbers or letters from 
Step 2 to show the source of every input to each component of 
regulatory capital reported using the template set out in Annex 11A. 
 
11.3.23 
The 3-step approach described above offers the following benefits:  
 
(a) 
the level of disclosure is proportionate, varying with the complexity of the 
balance sheet and capital structure of a Reporting Bank. Where no further 
information is added by a step, the Reporting Bank can skip the step; 
 
 
1126 
This refers to legal entities that are included in the regulatory scope of consolidation, but excluded from 
the accounting scope of consolidation.  
1127 
The Reporting Bank would only need to expand the lines of the balance sheet to the extent necessary to 
reach the components of capital disclosed in the capital disclosure template set out in Annex 11A.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
11-124 
(b) 
users can trace the origin of the elements of the regulatory capital back 
to their exact location on the Reporting Bank’s balance sheet under the 
regulatory scope of consolidation; 
 
(c) 
the approach is flexible enough to be used under any accounting standard. 
The Reporting Bank is required to map all regulatory capital components 
reported in the disclosure template back to its balance sheet under the 
regulatory scope of consolidation regardless of whether the accounting 
standards require the source to be reported on the balance sheet.  
 
 
Main Features Template 
 
11.3.24 
To ensure that the main features of the regulatory capital instruments of a 
Reporting Bank are disclosed in a consistent and comparable way, the Reporting Bank 
must complete, for each regulatory capital instrument issued, the main features template 
set out in Annex 11C of this Part.  
 
11.3.25 
This template represents the minimum level of summary disclosure that a 
Reporting Bank is required to report in respect of each regulatory capital instrument issued. 
In this regard, the Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
report each regulatory capital instrument issued, including ordinary 
shares, in a separate column of the template, such that the completed 
template provides a ‘main features report’ that summarises all of the 
regulatory capital instruments of the Reporting Bank’s banking group; 
 
(b)  disclose the list of features set out in Annex 11C and any other features 
of its regulatory capital instruments that it deems to be important; 
 
(c)  keep the main features report up to date, such that the disclosure is 
updated and made publicly available whenever the Reporting Bank issues 
or repays a capital instrument and whenever there is a redemption, 
conversion/write-down or other material change in the nature of an 
existing capital instrument; and 
 
(d)  ensure that the main features report is included in the Reporting Bank’s 
published financial statements or, at a minimum, that these financial 
statements provide a URL to where the main features report can be found 
on the Reporting Bank’s website or publicly available regulatory reports. 
 
 
Other Disclosure Requirements 
 
11.3.26 
A Reporting Bank which discloses non-regulatory ratios
1128  involving 
components of regulatory capital, must accompany such disclosures with a comprehensive 
explanation of how these ratios are calculated. 
 
11.3.27 
A Reporting Bank must make available on its website, the full terms and 
conditions of all capital instruments included in its regulatory capital. This will allow users 
to investigate the specific features of individual capital instruments. Such disclosures must 
be updated whenever the Reporting Bank issues or repays a capital instrument and 
 
1128 
For example, “Equity Tier 1”, “Core Tier 1” or “Tangible Common Equity” ratios.  


 
Monetary Authority of Singapore 
11-125 
whenever there is a redemption, conversion/write-down or other material change in the 
nature of an existing capital instrument. 
 
11.3.28 
A Reporting Bank must also maintain a section on its website, where all the 
information relating to disclosure of regulatory capital is made available to users 
(“regulatory disclosures section”). In cases where the disclosure requirements set out in 
this Sub-division are met via publication through publicly available regulatory reports, the 
regulatory disclosures section of the Reporting Bank’s website must provide URLs to the 
relevant regulatory reports that relate to the Reporting Bank.  
 
11.3.29 
A Reporting Bank is encouraged to include the information disclosed in the 
regulatory disclosures section of the website in its published financial statements. At a 
minimum, the Reporting Bank must ensure that the published financial statements direct 
users to the relevant section of its website, where the full set of required regulatory 
disclosure is provided.

11.3.31 
Regardless of the location of the disclosure, a Reporting Bank must make all 
disclosures in the format set out in this Sub-division. To prevent a divergence of formats 
that could undermine the objectives of consistency and comparability, the Reporting Bank 
must not add, delete or change the definitions of any rows from the templates set out in

Table 11-55: Disclosure of G-SIB Indicators 
Purpose 
Provide an overview of the indicators for assessing the systemic 
importance of global banks. 
Scope of 
application  
The template is mandatory for Reporting Banks where the Reporting 
Bank (i) has been classified as a G-SIB1129 in the previous year; (ii) 
has a leverage ratio exposure measure1130 exceeding EUR 200 billion; 
or (iii) has been included in the BCBS’ G-SIB assessment sample by 
the Authority based on supervisory judgment.1131 
 
For application of the threshold of EUR 200 billion, Reporting Banks 
must use the applicable exchange rate information provided on the 
BCBS website at www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/. The disclosure itself is 
made in the Reporting Bank’s own currency. 
Content  
At least the 13 indicators (including the two sub-indicators for the 
trading volume indicator, i.e. (i) trading volume of fixed income, and 
(ii) trading volume of equities and other securities) used in the 
assessment methodology of the G-SIB framework.1132 
Frequency  
Annually, or in circumstances when a Reporting Bank is required to 
restate figures to reflect final data submitted to the BCBS1133. This 
template must also be included in a Reporting Bank’s financial year-
end Pillar 3 report. 
Format  
Flexible. The information disclosed must be fully consistent with the 
data submitted to the Authority for subsequent remittance to the 
BCBS in the context of its annual data collection exercise for the 
assessment and identification of G-SIBs. 
 
Where Reporting Banks disclose the full breakdown of the indicators, 
such disclosure must take place using the template and related 
instructions that sample Reporting Banks use to report their data for 
the BCBS’ data collection exercise or as required by the Authority.1134 
Accompanying 
narrative 
A Reporting Bank must indicate the annual reference date of the 
information reported as well as the date of first public disclosure. A 
Reporting Bank must include a web link to the disclosure of the 
previous G-SIB assessment exercise. 
 
A Reporting Bank may supplement the template with a narrative 
commentary to explain any relevant qualitative characteristic deemed 
necessary for understanding the quantitative data. This information 
may include explanations about the use of estimates with a short 
explanation as regards the method used, mergers or modifications of 
the legal structure of the entity subjected to the reported data, the 
 
1129 
The list of G-SIBs will be designated annually based on the BCBS’ methodology for assessing the systemic 
importance of G-SIBs. 
1130 
For G-SIB assessment purposes, the applicable leverage ratio exposure measure definition is contained in 
the Basel III leverage ratio standard of January 2014. Its scope also includes exposures arising from 
insurance subsidiaries.

Definitions  
(a) 
Encumbered assets: Encumbered assets are assets that the Reporting Bank is 
restricted or prevented from liquidating, selling, transferring or assigning due to 
legal, regulatory, contractual or other limitations. To avoid doubt, an asset that 
falls within this definition is an encumbered asset regardless whether the 
Reporting Bank has the ability to monetise these assets during a stress period or 
whether these assets qualify as high quality liquid assets under MAS Notice 649. 
(b) 
Unencumbered assets: Unencumbered assets are assets which do not fall within 
the definition of encumbered assets. 
Instructions 
(c) 
Total (in column (c)): This is the sum of encumbered assets and unencumbered 
assets. The scope of consolidation for the purposes of this disclosure requirement 
must be based on the Reporting Bank's regulatory scope of consolidation, 
including its securitisation and securitised exposures.

RECONCILIATION OF REGULATORY CAPITAL TO BALANCE SHEET 
 
Table 11B-1: Reconciliation of Regulatory Capital to Balance Sheet 
Purpose 
To enable users to identify the differences between the scope of 
accounting consolidation and the scope of regulatory consolidation, and 
to show the link between a Reporting Bank’s balance sheet in its 
published financial statements and the numbers that are used in the 
composition of capital disclosure template set out in Table 11A-1. 
Scope of 
application 
The table is mandatory for all Reporting Banks. 
Content 
Carrying values (corresponding to the values reported in financial 
statements. 
Frequency 
Semi-annually. The frequency of disclosure may, with the prior 
approval of the Authority, be made with at least the same frequency as 
the publication of the Reporting Bank’s financial statements. Despite 
the cancellation of MAS Notice 637 in force immediately before 1 July 
2024, any approval granted under footnote 800A of MAS Notice 637 in 
force immediately before 1 July 2024, that was in force immediately 
before 1 July 2024, is treated as an approval granted under paragraph 
11.3.2 of this Notice. The Authority may at any time vary or revoke any 
existing conditions or restrictions of approval, or impose conditions or 
restrictions, or additional conditions or restrictions. 
Format 
Flexible (but the rows must align with the presentation of the Reporting 
Bank’s financial statements). 
Accompanying 
narrative 
The Reporting Bank must explain any significant changes in the 
expanded balance sheet items over the semi-annual reporting period 
and the key drivers of such changes. The Reporting Bank may explain 
significant changes in other balance sheet items in the narrative 
commentary of Table 11-9.

Items marked with a hash [#] are elements where a more conservative definition has been 
applied relative to those set out under the Basel III capital standards. 
 
A Reporting Bank must take its published financial statements (numbers reported in 
column (a) above) and report the numbers when the regulatory scope of consolidation is 
applied (numbers reported in column (b) above). This is referred to as Step 1 under the 
3-step approach to reconciliation, as explained and illustrated in paragraph 11.3.22(a). 
 
If there are rows in the balance sheet under the regulatory scope of consolidation that are 
not present in the published financial statements, a Reporting Bank is required to add 
these and give a value of zero in column (a). 
 
If a Reporting Bank’s scope of accounting consolidation and its scope of regulatory 
consolidation are exactly the same, columns (a) and (b) must be merged and this fact 
must be clearly disclosed in the accompanying narrative. 
 
As in the case of Table 11-7, the rows in the above template set out in Table 11B-1 must 
follow the balance sheet presentation used by a Reporting Bank in its financial statements, 
on which basis the Reporting Bank is required to expand the balance sheet to identify all 
the items that are disclosed in Table 11A-1 (referred to as Step 2 under the 3-step 
approach to reconciliation, as explained and illustrated in paragraph 11.3.22(b)).1140 ,1141 
The Reporting Bank must make disclosure which is proportionate to the complexity of the 
Reporting Bank’s balance sheet. The Reporting Bank must give each item a reference 
number/letter in column (c) that is used as cross-reference to column (b) of Table 11A-1. 
 
Linkages across tables 
(a) 
The Reporting Bank must ensure that the amounts in columns (a) and (b) in Table 
11B-1 before balance sheet expansion (i.e. before Step 2) are same as the 
amounts in columns (a) and (b) in Table 11-7. 
(b) 
The Reporting Bank must cross-reference each expanded item to the 
corresponding item in Table 11A-1. 
 
 
 
 
 
1140 
For example, paid-in share capital may be reported as one line on the balance sheet. However, some 
elements of this may meet the requirements for inclusion in CET1 and other elements may only meet the 
requirements for AT1 or Tier 2, or may not meet the requirements for inclusion in regulatory capital at all. 
Therefore, if the Reporting Bank has some paid-in capital that feeds into the calculation of CET1 and some 
that feeds into the calculation of AT1, it must expand the “paid-in capital” line of the balance sheet in the 
manner illustrated in Table 11B-1. As another example, one of the regulatory adjustments is the deduction 
of goodwill net of any associated deferred tax liability that would be extinguished if the goodwill becomes 
impaired or derecognised under the Accounting Standards. The Reporting Bank must expand elements of 
the balance sheet in the manner illustrated in Table 11B-1 to separately identify the components of goodwill 
and the associated deferred tax liability. 
1141 
Items (a) to (h) in Table 11B-1 are examples of items that may need to be expanded for a particular 
banking group.

MAIN FEATURES OF REGULATORY CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS  
 
A Reporting Bank is required to complete Table 11C-1 for each outstanding regulatory 
capital instrument (Reporting Banks must insert “NA” if the question is not applicable). 
 
A Reporting Bank is required to report each instrument, including common shares, in a 
separate column of Table 11C-1, such that the completed Table 11C-1 will provide a “main 
features report” that summarises all of the regulatory capital instruments of the banking 
group. 
 
Using the reference numbers in the left-hand column of Table 11C-1, Table 11C-1A 
provides a more detailed explanation of what a Reporting Bank is required to report in 
each of the cells. Table 11C-1A sets out the explanation of each row of Table 11C-1. 
 
Table 11C-1: Main Features of Regulatory Capital Instruments 
Purpose 
To provide a description of the main features of a Reporting Bank’s 
regulatory capital instruments that are recognised as part of its capital 
base under Part VI of this Notice.  
Scope of 
application 
The table is mandatory for all Reporting Banks.  
Content 
Quantitative and qualitative information as required. 
Frequency 
Table 11C-1 must be posted on the Reporting Bank’s website. It must 
be updated whenever the Reporting Bank issues or repays a capital 
instrument, 
and 
whenever 
there 
is 
a 
redemption, 
conversion/writedown or other material change in the nature of an 
existing instrument. The Reporting Bank must, at a minimum, update

Scope of 
application  
The table is mandatory for all Reporting Banks. 
Content  
Quantitative information.1145 A Reporting Bank must report disclosures 
on a quarter-end basis. However, the Reporting Bank may, with prior 
approval of the Authority, use more frequent calculations1146. The 
Reporting Bank is required to include the basis for the frequency of its 
disclosures.1147  
Frequency  
Quarterly. The frequency of disclosure may, with the prior approval of 
the Authority, be made with at least the same frequency as the 
publication of the Reporting Bank’s financial statements. Despite the 
cancellation of MAS Notice 637 in force immediately before 1 July 2024, 
any approval granted under footnote 800B of MAS Notice 637 in force 
immediately before 1 July 2024, that was in force immediately before 
1 July 2024, is treated as an approval granted under paragraph 11.3.3 
of this Notice. The Authority may at any time vary or revoke any 
existing conditions or restrictions of approval, or impose conditions or 
restrictions, or additional conditions or restrictions.

This is the total consolidated assets of a Reporting Bank as per its published 
financial statements. 
2 
This is the adjustment for investments in entities that are consolidated for 
accounting purposes, but outside the regulatory scope of consolidation in 
accordance with paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 of Annex 4C. 
3 
This row shows the reduction of the leverage ratio exposure measure due to 
the exclusion of securitised exposures that meet the operational 
requirements for the recognition of risk transference in accordance with 
Section 1 of Annex 7AC. As these adjustments reduce the total leverage ratio 
exposure measure, the Reporting Bank must report such adjustments as a 
negative amount. 
4 
This relates to paragraph 2.10 of Annex 4C. 
5 
This row shows adjustments for regular-way purchases and sales of financial 
assets subject to trade date accounting. The adjustment reflects (i) the 
reverse-out of any offsetting between cash receivables for unsettled sales 
and cash payables for unsettled purchases of financial assets that may be 
recognised under the Accounting Standards, and (ii) the offset between 
those cash receivables and cash payables that are eligible in accordance with 
the criteria specified in paragraph 2.11 of Annex 4C. If this adjustment leads 
to an increase in exposure, the Reporting Bank must report the adjustment 
as a positive amount. If this adjustment leads to a decrease in exposure, the 
Reporting Bank must report the adjustment as a negative amount. 
6 
This row shows adjustments for cashpooling arrangements that meet the 
criteria in paragraph 2.12 of Annex 4C. The adjustment is the difference 
between the accounting value of cashpooling arrangements and the 
treatments specified in paragraph 2.12 of Annex 4C. If this adjustment leads 
to an increase in exposure, the Reporting Bank must report the adjustment 
as a positive amount. If this adjustment leads to a decrease in exposure, the 
Reporting Bank must report the adjustment as a negative amount. 
7 
This is the adjustment for the difference between the calculation of derivative 
transactions in accordance with the Accounting Standards, and the 
calculation of derivative transactions in accordance with paragraphs 2.13 to 
2.39 of Annex 4C (“derivative exposure measures”). 
8 
This is the adjustment for the difference between the calculation of SFTs in 
accordance with the Accounting Standards, and the calculation of SFTs in 
accordance with paragraphs 2.40 to 2.50 of Annex 4C (“SFT exposure 
measures”).
