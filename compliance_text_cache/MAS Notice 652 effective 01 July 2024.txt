of MAS Notice 649. 
 
Calculation Methodology 
 
(A) 
ASF Calculation Methodology 
 
6 
The amount of ASF is calculated based on the broad characteristics of the relative 
stability of a Reporting Bank’s funding sources, including the contractual maturity of its 
liabilities and the differences in the propensity of different types of funding providers to 
withdraw their funding. A Reporting Bank must calculate its ASF by first assigning the carrying 
value of its capital and liabilities to one of the categories set out in paragraphs 7 to 193 and 
 
2      [Deleted by MAS Notice 652 (Amendment) 2024] 
3 
Table 1 in the Annex provides a summary of the categories and the assigned ASF factors. 


 
5 
 
multiplying the carrying value with the assigned ASF factor. The total ASF is the sum of the 
weighted amounts. 
 
7 
A Reporting Bank must assign the following liabilities and capital instruments a 
100% ASF factor: 
 
(a) 
the total amount of regulatory capital, before the application of capital 
deductions, excluding the proportion of Tier 2 instruments with residual 
maturity of less than one year; 
 
(b) 
the total amount of any capital instrument not included in sub-paragraph (a) 
that has an effective residual maturity of one year or more, but excluding any 
instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce 
the expected maturity to less than one year; 
 
(c) 
the total amount of secured and unsecured borrowings and liabilities 
(including term deposits) with effective residual maturities of one year or more. 
Cash flows falling below the one-year horizon but arising from liabilities with a 
final maturity more than one year do not qualify for the 100% ASF factor; 
 
(d) 
term deposits with residual maturities of more than one year that cannot be 
withdrawn early without paying a penalty that is materially greater than the 
loss of interest and are provided by retail and small business customers. 
 
8 
A Reporting Bank must assign the following liabilities a 95% ASF factor: 
 
(a) 
stable deposits that are demand deposits provided by retail and small business 
customers; 
 
(b) 
stable deposits that are term deposits with residual maturities of less than one 
year provided by retail and small business customers; 
 
(c) 
stable deposits that are term deposits with residual maturities of more than 
one year, can be withdrawn early without having to pay a penalty that is 
materially greater than the loss of interest and are provided by retail and small 
business customers. 
 
9 
A Reporting Bank must assign the following liabilities a 90% ASF factor: 
 
(a) 
less stable deposits that are demand deposits provided by retail and small 
business customers; 
 


 
6 
 
(b) 
less stable deposits that are term deposits with residual maturities of less than 
one year provided by retail and small business customers; 
 
(c) 
less stable deposits that are term deposits with residual maturities of more 
than one year, can be withdrawn early without having to pay a penalty that is 
materially greater than the loss of interest and are provided by retail and small 
business customers. 
 
10 
A Reporting Bank must assign the following liabilities a 50% ASF factor: 
 
(a) 
funding (secured and unsecured) with a residual maturity of less than one year 
provided by non-financial corporates; 
 
(b) 
operational deposits as determined in accordance with paragraph 11, for 
which a Reporting Bank has obtained the approval of the Authority pursuant 
to paragraph 62 of MAS Notice 649; 
 
(c) 
funding with residual maturity of less than one year from sovereigns, PSEs, and 
multilateral and national development banks; 
 
(d) 
other funding (secured and unsecured) not included in paragraphs 7 to 9 with 
residual maturity between 6 months to less than one year, including funding 
from central banks and financial institutions. 
 
11 
For the purposes of paragraph 10(b), a Reporting Bank must determine operational 
deposits as follows: 
 
(a) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that operational deposits only include 
deposits from customers receiving qualifying clearing, custody and cash 
management services from the Reporting Bank (“qualifying operational 
deposits”); 
 
(b) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that qualifying clearing, custody or cash 
management services meet the following criteria: 
 
(i) 
the customer is reliant on the Reporting Bank to perform these services 
as an independent third party intermediary in order to fulfil its normal 
banking activities over the next 30 days4; 
 
 
4 
For example, this condition would not be met if the Reporting Bank is aware that the customer has adequate 
back-up arrangements. 


 
7 
 
(ii) 
the Reporting Bank is providing these services under a legally binding 
agreement to customers; 
 
(iii) 
the customer may only terminate the agreement referred to in sub-
paragraph (b)(ii) by giving prior notice of at least 30 days or paying 
significant switching costs5 if the operational deposits are withdrawn 
before 30 days; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank must ensure that qualifying operational deposits 
generated from the qualifying clearing, custody and cash management 
services meet the following criteria: 
 
(i) 
the deposits are by-products of the underlying services provided by the 
Reporting Bank and not sought out in the wholesale market in the sole 
interest of offering interest income; 
 
(ii) 
the deposits are held in specifically designated accounts and priced 
without giving an economic incentive to the customer6 to leave any 
excess balances in these accounts. In the case that interest rates in a 
country or jurisdiction are close to zero, such accounts are likely to be 
non-interest bearing.7 The Reporting Bank must not treat any excess 
balances that may be withdrawn while still leaving sufficient funds to 
fulfil the qualifying clearing, custody and cash management services as 
qualifying operational deposits; 
 
(d) 
the Reporting Bank must determine the methodology for identifying excess 
balances that are excluded from this category. The Reporting Bank must 
conduct the assessment based on the methodology at a sufficiently granular 
level to adequately assess the risk of withdrawal in an idiosyncratic stress. The 
Reporting Bank must ensure that the methodology takes into account relevant 
factors8, and considers appropriate indicators9 to identify those customers 
that are not actively managing account balances efficiently; 
 
 
5 
For example, those related to transaction, information technology, early termination or legal costs. 
6 
To avoid doubt, paying market interest rates for the deposits is not sufficient for the Reporting Bank to 
determine that the deposits are priced without giving an economic incentive to the customer. 
7 
The Reporting Bank should be particularly aware that during prolonged periods of low interest rates, excess 
balances could be significant. 
8 
For example, the likelihood that wholesale customers have above average balances in advance of specific 
payment needs. 
9 
For example, ratios of account balances to payment or settlement volumes or to assets under custody. 


 
8 
 
(e) 
the Reporting Bank must not treat any deposit arising out of correspondent 
banking or from the provision of prime brokerage services as qualifying 
operational deposits. 
 
12 
A Reporting Bank must assign the following liabilities a 0% ASF factor: 
 
(a) 
all other liabilities and equities not included in paragraphs 7 to 10, including 
other funding with residual maturity of less than 6 months from central banks 
and financial institutions, including banks within the same institutional 
network of cooperative banks; 
 
(b) 
other liabilities without a stated maturity10. The only exceptions for liabilities 
without a stated maturity are the following and the Reporting Bank must 
assign such liabilities either a 100% ASF factor if the effective maturity is one 
year or more, or a 50% ASF factor if the effective maturity is between 6 months 
and less than one year: 
 
(i) 
first, deferred tax liabilities, which should be treated according to the 
nearest possible date on which such liabilities could be realised; 
 
(ii) 
second, minority interest, which should be treated according to the 
term of the instrument, usually in perpetuity; 
 
(c) 
NSFR derivative liabilities net of NSFR derivative assets, if NSFR derivative 
liabilities are greater than NSFR derivative assets11, where NSFR derivative 
liabilities are calculated in accordance with paragraphs 18 and 19 and NSFR 
derivative assets are calculated in accordance with paragraphs 38 to 40; and 
 
(d) 
trade date payables arising from purchases of financial instruments, foreign 
currencies and commodities that – 
 
(i) 
are expected to settle within the standard settlement cycle or period 
that is customary for the relevant exchange or type of transaction; or 
 
(ii) 
have failed to, but are still expected to settle. 
 
13 
To determine the maturity of an equity or liability instrument, a Reporting Bank must 
assume that investors will redeem a call option at the earliest possible date. 
 
 
10 
This may include short positions and open maturity positions. 
11 
ASF = 0% x MAX ((NSFR derivative liabilities – NSFR derivative assets), 0). 


 
9 
 
14 
For funding with options exercisable at a Reporting Bank’s discretion, including 
options to extend the maturity date of its obligations, the Reporting Bank must take into 
account reputational factors that may limit its ability not to exercise the option.12 In particular, 
where the market expects certain liabilities to be redeemed before their legal final maturity 
date, the Reporting Bank must assume such behaviour for the purposes of the NSFR and 
include these liabilities in the corresponding ASF category. 
 
15 
For long-dated liabilities, a Reporting Bank must treat only the portion of cash flows 
falling at or beyond the 6-month and one-year time horizons as having an effective residual 
maturity of 6 months or more and one year or more, respectively. 
 
16 
A Reporting Bank must treat unsecured precious metals liabilities in the same way as 
retail deposits and unsecured wholesale funding, with the appropriate ASF factors assigned 
in accordance with paragraphs 7 to 12. 
 
17 
A Reporting Bank that is a central institution or a specialised service provider of an 
institutional network of cooperative banks, may, with the Authority’s approval, assign an ASF 
factor of higher than 0% to the amount of deposits that members of the institutional network 
have placed with the Reporting Bank arising from statutory minimum deposit requirements 
or in the context of common task sharing and legal, statutory or contractual arrangements, 
so long as both the Reporting Bank that has received the deposits and the member of the 
institutional network that has placed the deposits participate in the same institutional 
network’s mutual protection scheme against illiquidity and insolvency of its members. Such 
deposits may be assigned an ASF factor up to the RSF factor assigned for the same deposits 
to the depositing bank, provided that such ASF factor does not exceed 85%. 
 
18 
A Reporting Bank must calculate derivative liabilities based on the replacement cost 
for derivative contracts (obtained by marking to market) where the contract has a negative 
value. When an eligible bilateral netting contract is in place that meets the conditions as set 
out in Annex 7G of MAS Notice 637, the Reporting Bank must take the replacement cost for 
the set of derivative exposures covered by the contract as the net replacement cost. The 
Reporting Bank may exclude, from its calculation, derivative transactions13 with central banks 
if such transactions – 
 
(a) 
arise from the central bank’s short-term monetary policy and liquidity 
operations; and 
 
 
12 
This refers to a case where the Reporting Bank may be subject to funding risk if it did not exercise an option 
on its own funding. 
13 
Such transactions include foreign exchange derivatives such as foreign exchange swaps. 


 
10 
 
(b) 
have a maturity of 6 months or less at inception. 
 
[MAS Notice 652 (Amendment) 2024] 
 
19 
In calculating NSFR derivative liabilities14, a Reporting Bank must deduct collateral 
posted in the form of variation margin in connection with derivative contracts (regardless of 
the asset type) from the negative replacement cost amount. To the extent that the Reporting 
Bank’s accounting framework reflects on balance sheet, in connection with a derivative 
contract, an asset associated with collateral posted as variation margin that is deducted from 
the replacement cost amount for purposes of the NSFR, the Reporting Bank must not include 
that asset in the calculation of the Reporting Bank’s RSF to avoid any double-counting. 
 
(B) 
RSF Calculation Methodology 
 
20 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the amount of RSF based on the broad characteristics 
of the liquidity risk profile of the Reporting Bank’s assets and OBS exposures. 
 
21 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the amount of RSF by first assigning the carrying value 
of its assets to one of the categories set out in paragraphs 41 to 5515 and multiplying the 
carrying value with the assigned RSF factor. The total RSF is the sum of the weighted amounts 
added to the amount of OBS exposures multiplied by its assigned RSF factor. 
 
22 
The RSF factors assigned to various types of assets are intended to approximate the 
amount of a particular asset that would have to be funded, either because it will be rolled 
over, or because it could not be monetised through sale or used as collateral in a secured 
borrowing transaction over the course of one year without significant expense. 
 
23 
A Reporting Bank must allocate assets to the appropriate RSF factor based on their 
residual maturity or liquidity value. 
 
24 
A Reporting Bank must assume that investors would exercise any option to extend 
maturity when determining the maturity of an instrument. For assets with options exercisable 
at the Reporting Bank’s discretion, the Reporting Bank must take into account reputational 
factors that may limit the Reporting Bank’s ability not to exercise the option.16 In particular, 
where the market expects certain assets to be extended in their maturity, the Reporting Bank 
must assume such behaviour for the purposes of the NSFR and include these assets in the 
corresponding RSF category. 
 
 
14 
NSFR derivative liabilities = (derivative liabilities) – (total collateral posted as variation margin on derivative 
liabilities). 
15 
Table 2 in the Annex provides a summary of the categories and the assigned RSF factors. 
16 
This refers to a case where the Reporting Bank may be subject to funding risk if it did not exercise an option 
on its own assets. 


 
11 
 
25 
For amortising loans and other principal repayment claims, a Reporting Bank must 
treat the portion that comes due within the one-year horizon in the less-than-one-year 
residual maturity category. 
 
26 
A Reporting Bank must treat an unencumbered loan without a stated final maturity 
date, even where the borrower may repay the loan in full and without penalty charges at the 
next reset date, as having an effective residual maturity of more than one year and must 
assign either a 65%, 85% or 100% RSF factor to the unencumbered loan in accordance with 
paragraph 46, 47 or 51. 
 
27 
A Reporting Bank must treat unsecured precious metals assets that must be settled 
by cash settlement in the same way as loans to retail customers and wholesale customers 
with the appropriate RSF factors assigned in accordance with paragraphs 41 to 55. 
 
28 
A Reporting Bank must assign unsecured precious metals assets that must be settled 
by physical delivery or where contractual arrangements allow for both physical delivery and 
cash settlement, with an RSF factor in the following manner: 
 
(a) 
in the case where the assets are – 
 
(i) 
extended to, or placed with, a financial institution, and has a residual 
maturity of one year or more; 
 
(ii) 
encumbered for a period of one year or more; or 
 
(iii) 
non-performing, 
 
assigned a 100% RSF factor; 
 
(b) 
in all other cases, treated in the same way as physical traded commodities and 
assigned an 85% RSF factor in accordance with paragraph 47(d). 
 
[MAS Notice 652 (Amendment) 2024] 
 
29 
Despite paragraph 28, a Reporting Bank must treat an unsecured precious metals 
asset referred to in paragraph 28 in the same way as loans to retail customers and wholesale 
customers, with the appropriate RSF factors assigned in accordance with paragraphs 41 to 55, 
if the Reporting Bank has adopted the treatment set out in paragraph 141 of MAS Notice 649. 
 
30 
To determine its RSF, a Reporting Bank must – 
 
(a) 
include financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a 
purchase order has been executed; and 


 
12 
 
 
(b) 
exclude financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a 
sales order has been executed, 
 
even if such transactions have not been reflected in the balance sheet under a 
settlement-date accounting model, provided that – 
 
(c) 
such transactions are not reflected as derivatives or secured financing 
transactions in the Reporting Bank’s balance sheet; and 
 
(d) 
the effects of such transactions will be reflected in the Reporting Bank’s 
balance sheet when settled. 
 
31 
A Reporting Bank must assign encumbered assets17 on the balance sheet with an RSF 
factor in the following manner: 
 
(a) 
assets that are encumbered for one year or more must be assigned a 100% RSF 
factor18; 
 
(b) 
assets that are encumbered for a period of between 6 months and less than 
one year that would, if unencumbered, receive an RSF factor lower than or 
equal to 50%, must be assigned a 50% RSF factor; 
 
(c) 
assets that are encumbered for between 6 months and less than one year that 
would, if unencumbered, receive an RSF factor higher than 50% must be 
assigned that higher RSF factor; 
 
(d) 
assets that have less than 6 months remaining in the encumbrance period 
must be assigned the same RSF factor as an equivalent asset that is 
unencumbered. 
 
32 
Subject to paragraph 34, a Reporting Bank may assign reduced RSF factors to the 
following assets in the case of exceptional central bank liquidity operations: 
 
(a) 
assets that are posted as collateral for exceptional central bank liquidity 
providing operations may be assigned the same RSF factor assigned to the 
equivalent asset that is unencumbered; 
 
17 
Examples of encumbered assets include assets backing securities or covered bonds and assets pledged in 
securities financing transactions or collateral swaps. An asset pledged in a repo or secured transaction is 
considered encumbered for the term of the repo or secured transaction, even if the actual maturity of the 
collateral is shorter. 
18 
To avoid doubt, a 100% RSF factor applies to collateral pledged in a repo of secured transaction with a 
remaining maturity of one year or more, even if the collateral pledged matures in less than one year. 


 
13 
 
 
(b) 
claims on central banks with a residual maturity of more than 6 months that 
arise from exceptional central bank liquidity absorbing operations may be 
assigned a 5% RSF factor. 
 
33 
For the purposes of paragraph 32, exceptional central bank liquidity operations are 
non-standard, temporary operations conducted by a central bank in order to achieve its 
mandate in a period of market-wide financial stress or exceptional macroeconomic challenges. 
 
34 
A Reporting Bank must obtain the Authority’s approval before applying the treatment 
set out in paragraph 32 in the case of exceptional central bank liquidity operations conducted 
by a central bank other than the Authority. 
 
35 
For securities financing transactions, a Reporting Bank must in determining its assets 
– 
 
(a) 
exclude securities which it has borrowed in securities financing transactions19 
where it does not have beneficial ownership; 
 
(b) 
include securities it has lent in securities financing transactions where it retains 
beneficial ownership; and 
 
(c) 
exclude securities it has received through collateral swaps if those securities 
do not appear on its balance sheets. 
 
36 
Where a Reporting Bank has encumbered securities in repos or other securities 
financing transactions, but has retained beneficial ownership, and those assets remain on the 
Reporting Bank’s balance sheet, the Reporting Bank must allocate such securities to the 
appropriate RSF category in the manner set out in paragraphs 41 to 55. 
 
37 
A Reporting Bank must calculate the amounts receivable and payable under securities 
financing transactions on a gross basis, except that in the case of securities financing 
transactions with a single counterparty that meet the netting conditions set out in paragraphs 
2.40(a), 2.41 and 2.42 in Annex 4C of MAS Notice 637, the Reporting Bank may calculate the 
amounts receivable and payable under such securities financing transactions on a net basis. 
 
[MAS Notice 652 (Amendment) 2024] 
 
38 
A Reporting Bank must calculate derivative assets based on the replacement cost for 
derivative contracts (obtained by marking to market) where the contract has a positive value. 
When an eligible bilateral netting contract is in place that meets the conditions as set out in 
 
19 
These include reverse repos and collateral swaps. 


 
14 
 
Annex 7G of MAS Notice 637, the Reporting Bank must take the replacement cost for the set 
of derivative exposures covered by the contract as the net replacement cost. The Reporting 
Bank may exclude, from its calculation, derivative transactions20 with central banks if such 
transactions – 
 
(a) 
arise from the central bank’s short-term monetary policy and liquidity 
operations; and 
 
(b) 
have a maturity of 6 months or less at inception. 
 
[MAS Notice 652 (Amendment) 2024] 
 
39 
In calculating NSFR derivative assets21, a Reporting Bank must not offset the positive 
replacement cost amount with the collateral received in connection with derivative contracts 
regardless of whether or not netting is permitted under the Reporting Bank’s operative 
accounting or risk-based framework, unless the collateral is received in the form of cash 
variation margin and meets the conditions as set out in paragraphs 2.18 to 2.21 in Annex 4C 
of MAS Notice 637. 
 
[MAS Notice 652 (Amendment) 2024] 
 
40 
A Reporting Bank must not offset derivative assets with any remaining balance sheet 
liability associated with (a) variation margin received that does not meet the criteria as set 
out in paragraph 39 or (b) initial margin received, and must assign such balance sheet 
liabilities a 0% ASF factor. 
 
41 
A Reporting Bank must assign the following assets a 0% RSF factor: 
 
(a) 
coins and banknotes immediately available to meet obligations; 
 
(b) 
all central bank reserves (including required reserves and excess reserves), 
unless relevant supervisors or central bank have assigned RSF factors to these

49 
For the purposes of paragraph 48(f)(i)(A), (i)(iii)(A), (j)(iii)(A), (k)(iii)(A) and (l)(ii), in the 
event of split ratings, a Reporting Bank must determine the applicable rating in accordance 
with the method used in paragraph 7.3.30 of MAS Notice 637. 
 
[MAS Notice 652 (Amendment) 2024] 
 
50 
Despite paragraph 48(f)(i)(A), (i)(iii)(A), (j)(iii)(A), (k)(iii)(A) and (l)(ii), a Reporting Bank 
may recognise local rating scales (rather than international ratings) of a recognised ECAI if the 
corporate debt securities or covered bonds are held by the Reporting Bank for local currency 
liquidity needs arising from its operations in that local country or jurisdiction. 
 
51 
A Reporting Bank must assign the following assets a 100% RSF factor: 
 
(a) 
all assets that are encumbered for a period of one year or more; 
 
(b) 
NSFR derivative assets net of NSFR derivative liabilities, if NSFR derivative 
assets are greater than NSFR derivative liabilities30, where NSFR derivative 
assets are calculated in accordance with paragraphs 38 to 40 and NSFR 
derivative liabilities are calculated in accordance with paragraphs 18 and 19; 
 
(c) 
non-maturity reverse repos, unless the Reporting Bank can demonstrate to the 
Authority that the non-maturity reverse repo would effectively mature in less 
than one year; 
 
(d) 
all other assets not included in paragraphs 41 to 47, including non-performing 
loans, loans to financial institutions with a residual maturity of one year or 
more, non-exchange-traded shares, fixed assets, items deducted from 
regulatory capital, retained interest, insurance assets, subsidiary interests and 
defaulted securities; 
 
(e) 
5% of derivative liabilities (that is negative replacement cost amounts) as 
calculated according to paragraph 18 before deducting variation margin 
posted. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph, for a derivative structured as 
“settled-to-market”, the Reporting Bank must calculate the replacement cost 
amount as if no settlement payments and receipts had been made to account 
for the changes in the value of a derivative transaction or a portfolio of 
derivative transactions. 
 
52 
For loans that are partially secured, a Reporting Bank must treat each of the secured 
and unsecured portions of a loan according to its characteristics and assign the corresponding 
RSF factor. If the Reporting Bank is unable to draw the distinction between the secured and 
 
30 
RSF = 100% x MAX ((NSFR derivative assets – NSFR derivative liabilities), 0). 


 
25 
 
unsecured part of the loan, the Reporting Bank must assign the higher RSF factor that is 
applicable to the whole loan. 
 
(C) 
Interdependent Assets and Liabilities 
 
53 
A Reporting Bank may assign interdependent assets and liabilities31 a 0% RSF or ASF 
factor if they meet the following criteria: 
 
(a) 
the individual interdependent asset and liability items must be clearly 
identifiable; 
 
(b) 
the maturity and principal amount of both the liability and its interdependent 
asset are the same; 
 
(c) 
the Reporting Bank is acting solely as a pass-through unit to channel the 
funding provided by the interdependent liability into the corresponding 
interdependent asset; 
 
(d) 
the counterparties for each pair of interdependent liabilities and assets are not 
the same. 
 
(D) 
OBS Exposures 
 
54 
Many potential OBS liquidity exposures require little direct or immediate funding but 
can lead to significant liquidity drains over a longer time horizon. The NSFR framework assigns 
an RSF factor to various OBS activities in order to ensure that institutions hold stable funding 
for the portion of OBS exposures that may be expected to require funding within a one-year 
horizon. 
 
55 
Consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio framework, the NSFR framework identifies 
OBS exposure categories based broadly on whether the commitment is a credit or liquidity 
facility or some other contingent funding obligation. A Reporting Bank must assign to each 
OBS category, an OBS exposure in accordance with Table 3 in the Annex, and multiply the OBS 
exposure by its RSF factor. 
 
Frequency of Calculation and Reporting 
 
56 
A Reporting Bank must prepare the following NSFR returns set out in Table 4 in the 
Annex as at the last day of each quarter, in accordance with the notes for completion: 
 
 
31 
To avoid doubt, derivative transactions do not qualify for the treatment in paragraph 53. 


 
26 
 
(a) 
in the case of a Reporting Bank set out in paragraph 2(a), the Reporting Bank’s 
– 
 
(i) 
Group level return; and 
 
(ii) 
Singapore Operations level return, which excludes the Reporting 
Bank’s subsidiaries and overseas branches; 
 
(b) 
in the case of a Reporting Bank set out in paragraph 2(b), the Reporting Bank’s 
entity level return; 
 
(c) 
in the case of a Reporting Bank set out in paragraph 2(c), the Reporting Bank’s 
– 
 
(i) 
country-level group level return; and 
 
(ii) 
entity level return. 
 
57 
A Reporting Bank must submit to the Authority the NSFR returns not later than 30 
days after the last day of each quarter. 
 
58 
Despite paragraph 57, if the day on which a Reporting Bank has to submit any return 
is not a business day, the Reporting Bank may submit the return on the next business day. 
 
Effective Date and Transitional Provisions 
 
59 
This Notice takes effect on 1 July 2022 (“effective date”). MAS Notice 652 dated 10 
July 2017 and last revised on 21 September 2020 is cancelled with effect from the effective 
date (the “Repealed Notice”). 
 
60 
Despite the Repealed Notice, in respect of the NSFR returns prepared as of the last 
day of the quarter immediately preceding the effective date in accordance with paragraph 44 
of the Repealed Notice, paragraph 57 of this Notice does not apply and a Reporting Bank must 
submit the NSFR returns in accordance with paragraph 45 of the Repealed Notice.
